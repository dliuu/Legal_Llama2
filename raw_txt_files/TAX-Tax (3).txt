§  503-a.  Imposition  of  additional  tax.  1. In addition to the tax
  imposed by section five hundred three of this chapter, and  in  addition
  to  any  other tax or fee imposed by law, there is hereby imposed on and
  after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight and before January first,
  nineteen hundred ninety-six an additional tax on  highway  use  for  the
  privilege  of  operating any vehicular unit, other than an omnibus, upon
  the public highways of this state,  and  on  and  after  October  first,
  nineteen  hundred  sixty-nine and before January first, nineteen hundred
  ninety-six an additional  tax  on  highway  use  for  the  privilege  of
  operating  upon the public highways of this state any omnibus which is a
  vehicular unit as defined in subdivision eight of this  section.    Such
  tax  shall  be upon the carrier except that where the carrier is not the
  owner of such vehicular unit, the tax  shall  be  a  joint  and  several
  liability upon both.
    2. Such tax shall be at a composite rate determined by adding together
  (i)  a  fuel  tax  component  which  shall be equivalent to the rate per
  gallon in effect under the taxes on motor fuel  and  diesel  motor  fuel
  imposed  by  article  twelve-a  of  this  chapter  and  (ii) a sales tax
  component, which shall be equivalent to the rate per  gallon  applicable
  to the receipts from the sale of a gallon of motor fuel and diesel motor
  fuel  in  effect  under  the sales and compensating use taxes imposed by
  sections eleven hundred five and eleven hundred ten of this chapter plus
  the highest rate applicable to the receipts from the sale of a gallon of
  motor fuel and diesel motor fuel in effect in any locality of this state
  imposing a local sales and compensating use tax on  the  sale  of  motor
  fuel and diesel motor fuel under the authority of section twelve hundred
  ten  of  this  chapter;  provided,  however, that the aggregate rate per
  gallon applicable to the receipts from the sale  of  a  gallon  of  such
  fuels  imposed  under  clause  (ii) of this subdivision shall not exceed
  seven percent. Such total equivalent rate per gallon under  clause  (ii)
  of  this  subdivision shall be determined as provided in subdivision (d)
  of section eleven hundred eleven  of  this  chapter  and  the  schedules
  prescribed  by the commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to such
  subdivision, and  shall  be  based  on  the  average  price  per  gallon
  (including  all  federal  and state and any local taxes included in such
  price or imposed on the use or consumption of such fuels but  determined
  without  the inclusion of any state and local sales tax on receipts from
  sales of such fuels) paid by the carrier during the  return  period  for
  all motor fuel and diesel motor fuel purchased for use in its operations
  either   within  or  without  this  state.  Provided,  however,  if  the
  commissioner shall  determine  that  the  records  of  any  carrier  are
  inadequate  or incomplete for such a determination of average price, the
  price for motor fuel and diesel motor fuel  purchased  by  such  carrier
  shall  be  deemed  to  be the prevailing price for motor fuel and diesel
  motor fuel, as established by the  commissioner  each  calendar  quarter
  pursuant to this section, applicable to the return period. Each calendar
  quarter,  the  commissioner  shall for each calendar quarter establish a
  prevailing price for motor fuel and  diesel  motor  fuel  based  on  the
  prices  being  charged on any given day during the first fifteen days of
  the previous calendar quarter at a minimum of ten selected  truck  stops
  widely  scattered throughout the state. For any return period, a carrier
  may elect to use the prevailing price per gallon so established  by  the
  commissioner.  Such  tax shall be computed by multiplying such composite
  rate by the amount of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel, as the  case  may
  be,  used  by  a carrier in its operations within this state during each
  calendar quarter or, where the commissioner has required or permitted  a
  return  to  be  based upon a different period, during such other period.
  The amount of motor fuel and diesel motor fuel used in the operations of


 any carrier within this state shall be  such  proportion  of  the  total
  amount  of  such  motor  fuel  and  diesel motor fuel used in its entire
  operations within and without this state as the total  number  of  miles
  traveled  within  this state bears to the total number of miles traveled
  within and without this state.  The  commissioner  may,  by  regulation,
  allow  use  of  a  miles  per  gallon  factor  in computing fuel used in
  operations in lieu of the above formula if evidence is presented to  the
  commissioner's  satisfaction  that no loss of revenue will result. Where
  the records of any carrier are inadequate or  incomplete  the  vehicular
  units  of  a carrier filing returns shall be deemed to have consumed, on
  the average, one gallon of  diesel  motor  fuel  for  every  four  miles
  traveled  or  one  gallon  of  motor fuel for every three miles traveled
  unless substantial  evidence  discloses  that  a  different  amount  was
  consumed.
    3.  Every  carrier subject to the tax imposed by this section shall be
  entitled to a credit against such tax determined by adding together  the
  following  components:  (i) a fuel tax component computed by multiplying
  the number of gallons of motor fuel or diesel motor  fuel  purchased  by
  such  carrier  within  this  state  in  a  return period, for use in its
  operations either within or without this state, by the  applicable  rate
  per  gallon imposed on such fuel under article twelve-A of this chapter,
  provided, however, no credit shall be allowed  unless  the  tax  imposed
  under  such article twelve-A upon such purchase of fuel has been paid by
  such carrier, and (ii) a sales tax component computed by multiplying the
  number of gallons of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel purchased  by  such
  carrier  within this state in a return period, for use in its operations
  either within or without this state (as determined in a  manner  similar
  to  the  method for determining the use of fuel in the state as provided
  for under subdivision two of this section), by the applicable equivalent
  rate per gallon  of  the  sales  tax  component  of  the  tax  rate  (as
  determined under subdivision two of this section), provided, however, no
  credit   shall   be   allowed  unless  the  tax  imposed  under  article
  twenty-eight of this chapter upon such purchase of fuel has been paid by
  the carrier. Each carrier claiming such credit components shall  furnish
  to  the  commissioner  such  evidence  of  payment  of such taxes as the
  commissioner may require. When the amount of the  credit  to  which  any
  carrier  is  entitled  for  any  return period with respect to gallonage
  purchased in such return period exceeds the amount of tax for which such
  carrier is liable under this section for such return period, such excess
  shall be allowed as a credit against the tax or which such carrier would
  otherwise be liable for those succeeding periods (after  application  of
  any  credits  derived  with  respect to gallonage purchased in each such
  succeeding period) which fall wholly within the twenty-four month period
  commencing with the end of the return period from which the  excess  was
  derived  or, if a claim for refund is filed on or before the last day of
  the month immediately following the forty-eight month period  commencing
  with  the  end  of  the return period which gave rise to the refund, the
  amount of such excess for such period shall be  refunded;  but,  such  a
  claim  for  refund  may be filed no more frequently than quarterly, with
  respect to the calendar quarters: January through March,  April  through
  June,  July  through  September  and  October  through  December.    The
  commissioner shall grant or deny any such claim for refund in  whole  or
  in  part  and  shall  notify  the claimant by mail of the commissioner's
  determination. Such determination shall be final and irrevocable  unless
  the  claimant  shall,  within thirty days after the mailing of notice of
  such determination, petition the division of tax appeals for a  hearing.
  After such hearing, the division of tax appeals shall mail notice of the
  determination of the administrative law judge to the claimant and to the


 commissioner.  Such  determination  may  be  reviewed by the tax appeals
  tribunal as provided in article forty of this chapter. The  decision  of
  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  may  be reviewed as provided in section two
  thousand  sixteen of this chapter. However, such a proceeding may not be
  commenced unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner  in  such
  amount  and  with  such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall
  approve to the effect  that  if  the  proceeding  be  dismissed  or  the
  decision  confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which
  may accrue against him in the prosecution of the proceeding.
    4. Except as otherwise provided in  this  subdivision,  every  carrier
  subject  to the tax imposed by this section shall file returns reporting
  its operations pursuant to the provisions of section five  hundred  five
  of  this article for the reporting periods provided pursuant thereto. If
  the commissioner of taxation and finance finds that the  enforcement  of
  the  tax  imposed  by  this section would not be adversely affected, the
  commissioner may  provide,  by  regulation,  that  a  carrier  operating
  primarily  within this state may file an information return, rather than
  the aforementioned returns, provided the carrier has purchased  in  this
  state  all  the  motor fuel and diesel motor fuel used in its operations
  during the period covered by such return  and  pays  the  taxes  imposed
  under  articles  twelve-a and twenty-eight and pursuant to the authority
  of article twenty-nine of this chapter  on  such  fuels  in  the  manner
  required  by  such  articles.  An election to file an information return
  shall be made in such form, for such time and upon  such  terms  as  the
  commissioner shall require.
    5.  At  the  time  of  filing  its return, as required pursuant to the
  preceding subdivision, each carrier shall pay the tax  imposed  by  this
  section  calculated  upon the amount of motor fuel and Diesel motor fuel
  used in its operations within this state during the  period  covered  by
  the return filed.
    6.  For  purposes  of  this section, the definition of "motor fuel" in
  subdivision two of section two hundred eighty-two and the definition  of
  "Diesel  motor  fuel"  in  subdivision  fourteen  of section two hundred
  eighty-two of this chapter shall apply.
    7.  For  purposes  of  this  section,  the  term  "operations"   means
  operations  of  all vehicular units, whether loaded or empty, whether or
  not for compensation and whether owned by or leased to the carrier which
  operates them or causes them to be operated.
    8. For purposes of this section only, (a) the  term  "vehicular  unit"
  shall   include   an  omnibus  engaged  in  the  interstate  or  foreign
  transportation of passengers and subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the
  interstate  commerce commission, or any agency successor thereto, or one
  or more state regulatory  agencies  concerned  with  the  regulation  of
  passenger  transport,  having  a  seating  capacity  of  more than seven
  persons in addition to the driver; and  (b)  the  term  "carrier"  shall
  include any person having the lawful use or control, or the right to the
  use or control of any such omnibus.
    9.  The  rest of the provisions of this article shall be applicable to
  the tax imposed by this section except to the extent such provisions are
  inconsistent with a provision in this section.


   §  503-b.  Supplemental  tax.  1.  In addition to the taxes imposed by
  sections five hundred three and five hundred three-a  of  this  article,
  and  in addition to any other tax or fee imposed by law, there is hereby
  imposed on and after July first, nineteen hundred ninety a  supplemental
  tax,  for  the privilege of operating any vehicular unit upon the public
  highways of this state and the purpose of recompensing the state for the
  public expenditures  incurred  by  reason  of  the  operations  of  such
  vehicular  units  on the public highways of this state, equal to the tax
  imposed by section five hundred three of this article.
    2. The provisions concerning returns under section five  hundred  five
  of  this  article  shall be applicable to this section. The supplemental
  tax imposed by this section shall be  payable  to  the  commissioner  of
  taxation  and  finance  in full at the time the return is required to be
  filed.
    3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all of the provisions
  of this article applicable to the tax imposed by  section  five  hundred
  three  of  this article shall apply with respect to the supplemental tax
  imposed by this section to the same extent as if it were imposed by such
  section five hundred three, insofar  as  such  provisions  can  be  made
  applicable  to  the  supplemental tax imposed by this section, with such
  modification as may  be  necessary  to  adapt  such  provisions  to  the
  supplemental tax imposed by this section.
    4. The provisions of this section shall not apply to (i) any vehicular
  unit  used  almost  exclusively to transport boltwood, logs, pulpwood or
  woodchips, and (ii)  any  vehicular  unit  used  almost  exclusively  to
  transport   raw,  unprocessed  milk  in  bulk,  provided,  however,  the
  provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) of this subdivision shall  not  apply
  to  any  carrier  or owner which operates more than three such vehicular
  units.
    5. Notwithstanding any other provision  of  this  article,  commencing
  January   first,   nineteen   hundred   ninety-nine   and  ending  March
  thirty-first, two thousand one, the  supplemental  tax  imposed  on  the
  privilege  of operating any motor vehicle unit shall be fifty percent of
  the tax imposed by section  five  hundred  three  of  this  article  and
  commencing  April  first, two thousand one, the supplemental tax imposed
  on the privilege of operating any motor  vehicle  unit  shall  be  forty
  percent  of  the  tax  imposed  by  section  five  hundred three of this
  article.






   §  503-b.  Supplemental  tax.  1.  In addition to the taxes imposed by
  sections five hundred three and five hundred three-a  of  this  article,
  and  in addition to any other tax or fee imposed by law, there is hereby
  imposed on and after July first, nineteen hundred ninety a  supplemental
  tax,  for  the privilege of operating any vehicular unit upon the public
  highways of this state and the purpose of recompensing the state for the
  public expenditures  incurred  by  reason  of  the  operations  of  such
  vehicular  units  on the public highways of this state, equal to the tax
  imposed by section five hundred three of this article.
    2. The provisions concerning returns under section five  hundred  five
  of  this  article  shall be applicable to this section. The supplemental
  tax imposed by this section shall be  payable  to  the  commissioner  of
  taxation  and  finance  in full at the time the return is required to be
  filed.
    3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all of the provisions
  of this article applicable to the tax imposed by  section  five  hundred
  three  of  this article shall apply with respect to the supplemental tax
  imposed by this section to the same extent as if it were imposed by such
  section five hundred three, insofar  as  such  provisions  can  be  made
  applicable  to  the  supplemental tax imposed by this section, with such
  modification as may  be  necessary  to  adapt  such  provisions  to  the
  supplemental tax imposed by this section.
    4. The provisions of this section shall not apply to (i) any vehicular
  unit  used  almost  exclusively to transport boltwood, logs, pulpwood or
  woodchips, and (ii)  any  vehicular  unit  used  almost  exclusively  to
  transport   raw,  unprocessed  milk  in  bulk,  provided,  however,  the
  provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) of this subdivision shall  not  apply
  to  any  carrier  or owner which operates more than three such vehicular
  units.
    5. Notwithstanding any other provision  of  this  article,  commencing
  January   first,   nineteen   hundred   ninety-nine   and  ending  March
  thirty-first, two thousand one, the  supplemental  tax  imposed  on  the
  privilege  of operating any motor vehicle unit shall be fifty percent of
  the tax imposed by section  five  hundred  three  of  this  article  and
  commencing  April  first, two thousand one, the supplemental tax imposed
  on the privilege of operating any motor  vehicle  unit  shall  be  forty
  percent  of  the  tax  imposed  by  section  five  hundred three of this
  article.




   §  503-a.  Imposition  of  additional  tax.  1. In addition to the tax
  imposed by section five hundred three of this chapter, and  in  addition
  to  any  other tax or fee imposed by law, there is hereby imposed on and
  after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight and before January first,
  nineteen hundred ninety-six an additional tax on  highway  use  for  the
  privilege  of  operating any vehicular unit, other than an omnibus, upon
  the public highways of this state,  and  on  and  after  October  first,
  nineteen  hundred  sixty-nine and before January first, nineteen hundred
  ninety-six an additional  tax  on  highway  use  for  the  privilege  of
  operating  upon the public highways of this state any omnibus which is a
  vehicular unit as defined in subdivision eight of this  section.    Such
  tax  shall  be upon the carrier except that where the carrier is not the
  owner of such vehicular unit, the tax  shall  be  a  joint  and  several
  liability upon both.
    2. Such tax shall be at a composite rate determined by adding together
  (i)  a  fuel  tax  component  which  shall be equivalent to the rate per
  gallon in effect under the taxes on motor fuel  and  diesel  motor  fuel
  imposed  by  article  twelve-a  of  this  chapter  and  (ii) a sales tax
  component, which shall be equivalent to the rate per  gallon  applicable
  to the receipts from the sale of a gallon of motor fuel and diesel motor
  fuel  in  effect  under  the sales and compensating use taxes imposed by
  sections eleven hundred five and eleven hundred ten of this chapter plus
  the highest rate applicable to the receipts from the sale of a gallon of
  motor fuel and diesel motor fuel in effect in any locality of this state
  imposing a local sales and compensating use tax on  the  sale  of  motor
  fuel and diesel motor fuel under the authority of section twelve hundred
  ten  of  this  chapter;  provided,  however, that the aggregate rate per
  gallon applicable to the receipts from the sale  of  a  gallon  of  such
  fuels  imposed  under  clause  (ii) of this subdivision shall not exceed
  seven percent. Such total equivalent rate per gallon under  clause  (ii)
  of  this  subdivision shall be determined as provided in subdivision (d)
  of section eleven hundred eleven  of  this  chapter  and  the  schedules
  prescribed  by the commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to such
  subdivision, and  shall  be  based  on  the  average  price  per  gallon
  (including  all  federal  and state and any local taxes included in such
  price or imposed on the use or consumption of such fuels but  determined
  without  the inclusion of any state and local sales tax on receipts from
  sales of such fuels) paid by the carrier during the  return  period  for
  all motor fuel and diesel motor fuel purchased for use in its operations
  either   within  or  without  this  state.  Provided,  however,  if  the
  commissioner shall  determine  that  the  records  of  any  carrier  are
  inadequate  or incomplete for such a determination of average price, the
  price for motor fuel and diesel motor fuel  purchased  by  such  carrier
  shall  be  deemed  to  be the prevailing price for motor fuel and diesel
  motor fuel, as established by the  commissioner  each  calendar  quarter
  pursuant to this section, applicable to the return period. Each calendar
  quarter,  the  commissioner  shall for each calendar quarter establish a
  prevailing price for motor fuel and  diesel  motor  fuel  based  on  the
  prices  being  charged on any given day during the first fifteen days of
  the previous calendar quarter at a minimum of ten selected  truck  stops
  widely  scattered throughout the state. For any return period, a carrier
  may elect to use the prevailing price per gallon so established  by  the
  commissioner.  Such  tax shall be computed by multiplying such composite
  rate by the amount of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel, as the  case  may
  be,  used  by  a carrier in its operations within this state during each
  calendar quarter or, where the commissioner has required or permitted  a
  return  to  be  based upon a different period, during such other period.
  The amount of motor fuel and diesel motor fuel used in the operations of


 any carrier within this state shall be  such  proportion  of  the  total
  amount  of  such  motor  fuel  and  diesel motor fuel used in its entire
  operations within and without this state as the total  number  of  miles
  traveled  within  this state bears to the total number of miles traveled
  within and without this state.  The  commissioner  may,  by  regulation,
  allow  use  of  a  miles  per  gallon  factor  in computing fuel used in
  operations in lieu of the above formula if evidence is presented to  the
  commissioner's  satisfaction  that no loss of revenue will result. Where
  the records of any carrier are inadequate or  incomplete  the  vehicular
  units  of  a carrier filing returns shall be deemed to have consumed, on
  the average, one gallon of  diesel  motor  fuel  for  every  four  miles
  traveled  or  one  gallon  of  motor fuel for every three miles traveled
  unless substantial  evidence  discloses  that  a  different  amount  was
  consumed.
    3.  Every  carrier subject to the tax imposed by this section shall be
  entitled to a credit against such tax determined by adding together  the
  following  components:  (i) a fuel tax component computed by multiplying
  the number of gallons of motor fuel or diesel motor  fuel  purchased  by
  such  carrier  within  this  state  in  a  return period, for use in its
  operations either within or without this state, by the  applicable  rate
  per  gallon imposed on such fuel under article twelve-A of this chapter,
  provided, however, no credit shall be allowed  unless  the  tax  imposed
  under  such article twelve-A upon such purchase of fuel has been paid by
  such carrier, and (ii) a sales tax component computed by multiplying the
  number of gallons of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel purchased  by  such
  carrier  within this state in a return period, for use in its operations
  either within or without this state (as determined in a  manner  similar
  to  the  method for determining the use of fuel in the state as provided
  for under subdivision two of this section), by the applicable equivalent
  rate per gallon  of  the  sales  tax  component  of  the  tax  rate  (as
  determined under subdivision two of this section), provided, however, no
  credit   shall   be   allowed  unless  the  tax  imposed  under  article
  twenty-eight of this chapter upon such purchase of fuel has been paid by
  the carrier. Each carrier claiming such credit components shall  furnish
  to  the  commissioner  such  evidence  of  payment  of such taxes as the
  commissioner may require. When the amount of the  credit  to  which  any
  carrier  is  entitled  for  any  return period with respect to gallonage
  purchased in such return period exceeds the amount of tax for which such
  carrier is liable under this section for such return period, such excess
  shall be allowed as a credit against the tax or which such carrier would
  otherwise be liable for those succeeding periods (after  application  of
  any  credits  derived  with  respect to gallonage purchased in each such
  succeeding period) which fall wholly within the twenty-four month period
  commencing with the end of the return period from which the  excess  was
  derived  or, if a claim for refund is filed on or before the last day of
  the month immediately following the forty-eight month period  commencing
  with  the  end  of  the return period which gave rise to the refund, the
  amount of such excess for such period shall be  refunded;  but,  such  a
  claim  for  refund  may be filed no more frequently than quarterly, with
  respect to the calendar quarters: January through March,  April  through
  June,  July  through  September  and  October  through  December.    The
  commissioner shall grant or deny any such claim for refund in  whole  or
  in  part  and  shall  notify  the claimant by mail of the commissioner's
  determination. Such determination shall be final and irrevocable  unless
  the  claimant  shall,  within thirty days after the mailing of notice of
  such determination, petition the division of tax appeals for a  hearing.
  After such hearing, the division of tax appeals shall mail notice of the
  determination of the administrative law judge to the claimant and to the


 commissioner.  Such  determination  may  be  reviewed by the tax appeals
  tribunal as provided in article forty of this chapter. The  decision  of
  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  may  be reviewed as provided in section two
  thousand  sixteen of this chapter. However, such a proceeding may not be
  commenced unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner  in  such
  amount  and  with  such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall
  approve to the effect  that  if  the  proceeding  be  dismissed  or  the
  decision  confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which
  may accrue against him in the prosecution of the proceeding.
    4. Except as otherwise provided in  this  subdivision,  every  carrier
  subject  to the tax imposed by this section shall file returns reporting
  its operations pursuant to the provisions of section five  hundred  five
  of  this article for the reporting periods provided pursuant thereto. If
  the commissioner of taxation and finance finds that the  enforcement  of
  the  tax  imposed  by  this section would not be adversely affected, the
  commissioner may  provide,  by  regulation,  that  a  carrier  operating
  primarily  within this state may file an information return, rather than
  the aforementioned returns, provided the carrier has purchased  in  this
  state  all  the  motor fuel and diesel motor fuel used in its operations
  during the period covered by such return  and  pays  the  taxes  imposed
  under  articles  twelve-a and twenty-eight and pursuant to the authority
  of article twenty-nine of this chapter  on  such  fuels  in  the  manner
  required  by  such  articles.  An election to file an information return
  shall be made in such form, for such time and upon  such  terms  as  the
  commissioner shall require.
    5.  At  the  time  of  filing  its return, as required pursuant to the
  preceding subdivision, each carrier shall pay the tax  imposed  by  this
  section  calculated  upon the amount of motor fuel and Diesel motor fuel
  used in its operations within this state during the  period  covered  by
  the return filed.
    6.  For  purposes  of  this section, the definition of "motor fuel" in
  subdivision two of section two hundred eighty-two and the definition  of
  "Diesel  motor  fuel"  in  subdivision  fourteen  of section two hundred
  eighty-two of this chapter shall apply.
    7.  For  purposes  of  this  section,  the  term  "operations"   means
  operations  of  all vehicular units, whether loaded or empty, whether or
  not for compensation and whether owned by or leased to the carrier which
  operates them or causes them to be operated.
    8. For purposes of this section only, (a) the  term  "vehicular  unit"
  shall   include   an  omnibus  engaged  in  the  interstate  or  foreign
  transportation of passengers and subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the
  interstate  commerce commission, or any agency successor thereto, or one
  or more state regulatory  agencies  concerned  with  the  regulation  of
  passenger  transport,  having  a  seating  capacity  of  more than seven
  persons in addition to the driver; and  (b)  the  term  "carrier"  shall
  include any person having the lawful use or control, or the right to the
  use or control of any such omnibus.
    9.  The  rest of the provisions of this article shall be applicable to
  the tax imposed by this section except to the extent such provisions are
  inconsistent with a provision in this section.




   §  503-b.  Supplemental  tax.  1.  In addition to the taxes imposed by
  sections five hundred three and five hundred three-a  of  this  article,
  and  in addition to any other tax or fee imposed by law, there is hereby
  imposed on and after July first, nineteen hundred ninety a  supplemental
  tax,  for  the privilege of operating any vehicular unit upon the public
  highways of this state and the purpose of recompensing the state for the
  public expenditures  incurred  by  reason  of  the  operations  of  such
  vehicular  units  on the public highways of this state, equal to the tax
  imposed by section five hundred three of this article.
    2. The provisions concerning returns under section five  hundred  five
  of  this  article  shall be applicable to this section. The supplemental
  tax imposed by this section shall be  payable  to  the  commissioner  of
  taxation  and  finance  in full at the time the return is required to be
  filed.
    3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all of the provisions
  of this article applicable to the tax imposed by  section  five  hundred
  three  of  this article shall apply with respect to the supplemental tax
  imposed by this section to the same extent as if it were imposed by such
  section five hundred three, insofar  as  such  provisions  can  be  made
  applicable  to  the  supplemental tax imposed by this section, with such
  modification as may  be  necessary  to  adapt  such  provisions  to  the
  supplemental tax imposed by this section.
    4. The provisions of this section shall not apply to (i) any vehicular
  unit  used  almost  exclusively to transport boltwood, logs, pulpwood or
  woodchips, and (ii)  any  vehicular  unit  used  almost  exclusively  to
  transport   raw,  unprocessed  milk  in  bulk,  provided,  however,  the
  provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) of this subdivision shall  not  apply
  to  any  carrier  or owner which operates more than three such vehicular
  units.
    5. Notwithstanding any other provision  of  this  article,  commencing
  January   first,   nineteen   hundred   ninety-nine   and  ending  March
  thirty-first, two thousand one, the  supplemental  tax  imposed  on  the
  privilege  of operating any motor vehicle unit shall be fifty percent of
  the tax imposed by section  five  hundred  three  of  this  article  and
  commencing  April  first, two thousand one, the supplemental tax imposed
  on the privilege of operating any motor  vehicle  unit  shall  be  forty
  percent  of  the  tax  imposed  by  section  five  hundred three of this
  article.




   §  504.  Exemptions. The provisions of this article shall not apply to
  any vehicular unit:
    1. Operating over  a  rural  route  and  engaged  exclusively  in  the
  transportation of United States mail under contract.

  own  agricultural  commodities  and  products,  pulpwood  or  livestock,
  including the packed, processed, or manufactured products thereof,  that
  were originally grown or raised on such farmer's farm, lands or orchard,
  or  when  used to transport supplies and equipment to such farmer's farm
  or orchard that are consumed and used thereon or when operated  by  such
  farmer  or  such  person  in  transporting  farm  products  from  a farm
  contiguous to such farmer's farm.
    (b) The relationship to such farmer as referenced in paragraph (a)  of
  this subdivision, shall include:
    (i)   members  of  a  family,  including  spouses,  ancestors,  lineal
  descendants, brothers and sisters (whether by the whole or half  blood),
  and   entities   related  to  such  a  family  member  as  described  in
  subparagraphs (ii) through (iv) of this paragraph;
    (ii) a shareholder and a corporation more than fifty  percent  of  the

  vehicle is filed to  compute  the  tax  under  the  method  provided  in
  subdivision three of section five hundred three of this chapter.
    5.  Used  exclusively  in  the  transportation  of household goods (as
  defined by the commissioner of  transportation  of  this  state  or  the
  interstate  commerce  commission)  by  a  carrier under authority of the
  commissioner of transportation  of  this  state  or  of  the  interstate
  commerce commission.
    6.  Owned  and  operated  by  any  fire  company or fire department as

   §  505.  Returns.  Every  carrier  subject  to  this article and every
  carrier to whom a certificate of registration was issued shall  file  on
  or before the last day of each month a return for the preceding calendar
  month  where  a carrier's total tax liability under this article for the
  preceding calendar  year  exceeded  twelve  thousand  dollars.  Where  a
  carrier's  total  tax  liability  under  this  article for the preceding
  calendar year did not exceed twelve thousand dollars or where a  carrier
  was  not  subject  to  such  tax in the preceding calendar year, returns
  shall be filed quarterly, on or before the  last  day  of  the  calendar
  month  following  each  of the calendar quarters: January through March,
  April through June, July through September and October through December.
  Provided, however, if the commissioner consents thereto in writing,  any
  carrier may file a return on or before the thirtieth day after the close
  of  any different period, if the carrier's books are regularly kept on a
  periodic basis other than a calendar month or quarter. The  commissioner
  may  permit  the  filing  of  returns  on  an annual basis, provided the
  carrier was subject to the tax under  this  article  during  the  entire
  preceding calendar year and the carrier's total tax liability under this
  article for such year did not exceed twelve hundred dollars. Such annual
  returns  shall  be  filed  on  or  before  January  thirty-first  of the
  succeeding calendar year. Returns shall be filed with  the  commissioner
  on forms to be furnished by such commissioner for such purpose and shall
  contain such data, information or matter as the commissioner may require
  to  be  included  therein. The fact that a carrier's name is signed to a
  filed return shall be prima facie evidence for  all  purposes  that  the
  return was actually signed by such carrier. The commissioner may grant a
  reasonable  extension  of  time  for  filing returns whenever good cause
  exists and may waive the filing of returns if a carrier is  not  subject
  to the tax imposed by this article for the period covered by the return.
  Every  return  shall  have annexed thereto a certification to the effect
  that the statements contained therein are true.




   §  506. Payment of tax. 1. At the time of filing a return, as required
  by this article, each carrier shall pay to the tax  commission  the  tax
  imposed  by this article for the period covered by such return. Such tax
  shall be due and payable at the time of  filing  the  return  or,  if  a
  return  is  not  filed  when due, on the last day on which the return is
  required to be filed.    The  tax  commission  may  grant  a  reasonable
  extension of time for paying the tax whenever good cause exists.
    2. The fees, taxes, penalties and interest accruing under this article
  shall  constitute  a  lien  upon  all motor vehicles and vehicular units
  which are owned by such carrier or of which he has  the  lawful  use  or
  control.  The  lien  shall  attach  at the time of operation of any such
  motor vehicle or vehicular unit  within  this  state  and  shall  remain
  effective until the fees, taxes, penalties and interest are paid, or the
  motor  vehicle  or vehicular unit is sold for the payment thereof.  Such
  liens shall be paramount to all  prior  liens  or  encumbrances  of  any
  character  and  to  the rights of any holder of the legal title in or to
  any such motor vehicle or vehicular unit, provided, however, that:
    a. No lien for any additional tax assessed pursuant  to  this  article
  shall  be  enforceable against any motor vehicle or vehicular unit which
  prior to such assessment had been transferred in good faith  to  a  bona
  fide transferee for value.
    b.  The  lien  of  such  tax  shall  be  subject  to  the  lien of any
  indebtedness  secured  by  a  chattel  mortgage  or  conditional   sales
  agreement existing against such motor vehicle or vehicular unit previous
  to the time when such tax became a lien, if:
    (1)  Such  indebtedness was incurred in good faith to secure a portion
  of the purchase price of such motor vehicle or vehicular unit, and
    (2) Such indebtedness is secured by a chattel mortgage or  conditional
  sales agreement duly filed as required by law, and
    (3)  Such  chattel  mortgage  or  conditional  sales agreement was not
  given, directly or indirectly, to any  officer  or  stockholder  of  the
  corporation  owning  or  having  the lawful use or control of such motor
  vehicle or vehicular unit, whether  as  a  purchase  money  mortgage  or
  otherwise.
    The  lien  of such tax shall be enforceable, however, as to any equity
  after the encumbrance of such  chattel  mortgage  or  conditional  sales
  agreement.  In  the  event  a motor vehicle or vehicular unit subject to
  such tax lien is repossessed by a chattel  mortgagee  or  a  conditional
  vendor  such motor vehicle or vehicular unit shall not be sold at public
  or private sale unless at least five days notice of the time  and  place
  of  such  sale  is  served by registered mail upon the tax commission in
  Albany.




   §  507.  Records.  Every  carrier  subject  to  this article and every
  carrier to whom a certificate of registration was issued  shall  keep  a
  complete  and  accurate daily record which shall show the miles traveled
  in this state by each vehicular unit and such other information  as  the
  commissioner  may  require.  Such  records  shall  be kept in this state
  unless the commissioner consents to their removal and shall be preserved
  for a period of four years and be open for inspection at any  reasonable
  time upon the demand of the commissioner.




   §  508.  Responsibility of owner. In those instances where the carrier
  is not the owner of the vehicular unit, the owner may  file  the  return
  and  maintain  the record required by section five hundred five and five
  hundred seven, and shall  be  jointly  and  severally  liable  with  the
  carrier for the payment of tax required under section five hundred six.




   §  509.  Powers  of  tax  commission.  In  addition to any other power
  conferred by this chapter the tax commission shall  have  the  following
  powers:
    1. To prescribe such methods and means as the commission determines to
  be  necessary  for  checking,  verifying  and ascertaining the number of
  miles traveled by, and the weight of, each vehicular unit on the  public
  highways in this state;
    2.  To  prescribe the method of accounts and the type of records to be
  kept by any carrier to the extent necessary to determine liability under
  this article;
    3. To weigh at reasonably frequent intervals any vehicular unit or any
  motor vehicle, as defined in section  one  hundred  twenty-five  of  the
  vehicle  and  traffic  law,  having  a gross weight in excess of sixteen
  thousand pounds, operating on the public highways in this state;
    4. To require any carrier subject to tax hereunder to file,  with  the
  department  of  taxation  and finance, a bond issued by a surety company
  approved by the superintendent of financial services as to solvency  and
  responsibility  and  authorized  to  transact  business in this state or
  other security acceptable to the tax commission, in such amount  as  the
  tax  commission  may  fix, to secure the payment of any monies which may
  become due from such carrier pursuant to this article. If securities are
  deposited as security under this subdivision, such securities  shall  be
  kept  in the custody of the comptroller and the commissioner of taxation
  and finance and may  be  sold  by  the  tax  commission  if  it  becomes
  necessary  so  to  do in order to recover any sums due from such carrier
  pursuant to this article; but no such sale shall be had until after such
  carrier shall have had an opportunity to litigate the  validity  of  any
  tax if it elects so to do. Upon such sale the surplus, if any, above the
  sums  due  under  this  article  shall  be returned to said carrier. The
  amount of the  bond  or  other  security  required  hereunder  shall  be
  reasonably  related  to the probable liability of the carrier under this
  article;
    5. To request the division of state police, the  state  department  of
  transportation  and other public officials to cooperate in enforcing the
  provisions of this article;
    5-a. To take possession of any certificate of registration  which  has
  been  suspended  or revoked under the provisions of this article and any
  decal  issued  in  conjunction  therewith,  and   any   certificate   of
  registration  which is being used for a motor vehicle other than the one
  for which it was issued and any decal that is on a motor  vehicle  other
  than  the  one  for which it was issued, or to direct any peace officer,
  acting pursuant to his or her special duties, or any police  officer  or
  any employee of the department to take possession thereof and return the
  same to the commissioner.
    6. To release any property from the lien of any fees, taxes, penalties
  or  interest imposed by this article upon application made to it and the
  payment of a fee of one dollar provided payment be made of such a sum as
  the commission shall deem adequate consideration  for  such  release  or
  after  payment  of any such amount is secured to the satisfaction of the
  commission;
    7. To make reasonable rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes
  of this article.
    8. To issue replacement certificates of registration or decals at such
  times as  the  commissioner  may  deem  necessary  for  the  proper  and
  efficient  enforcement  of  the provisions of this article, but not more
  often than once every year and to require  the  surrender  of  the  then
  outstanding   certificates  of  registration  and  decals.  All  of  the
  provisions of this article with respect to certificates of  registration


 and   decals   shall   be  applicable  to  replacement  certificates  of
  registration and decals issued hereunder, except  that  the  replacement
  certificate  of  registration or decal shall be issued upon payment of a
  fee  of  one  dollar  and fifty cents for each motor vehicle and for any
  trailer, semi-trailer, dolly or other device drawn thereby for  which  a
  certificate of registration or decal is required to be issued under this
  article;
    9. To examine, or cause to be examined or cause any person to keep any
  books,  papers  or  records with respect to the operations on the public
  highways of this state of any vehicular unit or any  motor  vehicle,  if
  the  tax  commission has reasonable grounds to believe that such vehicle
  may be subject to the provisions of this  article  or  employed  in  the
  computation  of  the  taxes  imposed  by  this  article,  to require the
  attendance of any person having knowledge thereof and to take  testimony
  and  require  proof  under  oath  material  for its information, for the
  purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return filed with respect
  thereto or for the purpose  of  determining  tax  liability  under  this
  article;
    10.  To  waive  the  liability imposed by, or any requirement of, this
  article,  or  both,  under  such  conditions  and  limitations  as   the
  commissioner  may  prescribe,  as the commissioner may deem necessary to
  facilitate prompt relief to an area determined by the president  of  the
  United  States to warrant assistance by the federal government under the
  disaster relief and emergency assistance act.




   §  510.  Determination of tax. 1. In case any return filed pursuant to
  this  article  shall  be   insufficient   or   unsatisfactory   to   the
  commissioner,  or  if no return is made for any period, the commissioner
  shall determine the amount of  tax  due  from  such  information  as  is
  available  to  the commissioner. Such determination shall be made within
  four years from the time the return was filed or, if no return was filed
  or in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent  to
  evade   the   tax,   such   determination  may  be  made  at  any  time.
  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section,  where,
  before  the  expiration  of  the time prescribed in this section for the
  determination of tax,  both  the  commissioner  and  the  taxpayer  have
  consented  in  writing to its determination after such time, the tax may
  be determined at any time prior to the expiration of the  period  agreed
  upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements
  in  writing  made  before the expiration of the period previously agreed
  upon. The commissioner shall give notice of such  determination  to  the
  person  liable  for  such  tax.  Such  determination  shall  finally and
  conclusively fix such tax, unless the person against whom it is assessed
  shall,  within  ninety  days  after  the  giving  of  notice   of   such
  determination,  petition  the  division of tax appeals for a hearing, or
  unless the commissioner of his own motion shall  redetermine  the  same.
  After such hearing, the division of tax appeals shall give notice of the
  determination  of  the administrative law judge to the person liable for
  the tax and to the commissioner. Such determination may be  reviewed  by
  the  tax  appeals tribunal as provided in article forty of this chapter.
  The decision of the tax appeals tribunal may be reviewed as provided  in
  section  two thousand sixteen of this chapter. The proceeding may not be
  commenced unless the amount of any  tax  sought  to  be  reviewed,  with
  penalties  and  interest  thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with
  the commissioner and an undertaking filed with him, in such  amount  and
  with  such  sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to
  the effect that, if such proceeding be dismissed or the decision of  the
  tax  appeals  tribunal  confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and
  charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the  proceeding,  or,  at
  the  option  of  the  petitioner,  such  undertaking  may  be  in  a sum
  sufficient to cover the tax,  penalties,  interest,  costs  and  charges
  aforesaid,  in  which  event the petitioner shall not be required to pay
  such tax, penalties  and  interest  as  a  condition  precedent  to  the
  commencement of the proceeding.
    2.  The  remedy provided by subdivision one of this section for review
  of a decision of the tax appeals tribunal shall be the exclusive  remedy
  available  to judicially determine the liability of any person for taxes
  under this article.
    3. Any notice authorized or required under this article may  be  given
  by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a postpaid
  envelope,  addressed  to  such person at the address given by him in the
  application for a certificate of registration  or  in  the  last  return
  filed  by  him  under  this article, or, if no application or return has
  been filed then to such address as may be  obtainable.  The  mailing  of
  such  notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of same by the
  person to whom addressed.  Any  period  of  time,  which  is  determined
  according  to  the  provisions of this article, for the giving of notice
  shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.




   §  511.  Proceedings to recover tax. 1. Whenever any person shall fail
  to pay, within the time limited herein, any tax, interest  or  penalties
  which  he  is  required to pay under the provisions of this article, the
  attorney general shall, upon the request of the department  of  taxation
  and finance, enforce payment of such tax, interest or penalties by civil
  action,  in the name of the people of the state, against such person for
  the amount of such tax, interest  or  penalties.  The  proceeds  of  the
  judgment,  if  any,  shall  be  paid  to  the department of taxation and
  finance.
    2. Whenever any person shall fail to  pay,  within  the  time  limited
  herein, any tax which he is required to pay under the provisions of this
  article, the tax commission may issue a warrant under its official seal,
  directed  to  the  sheriff of any county of the state, commanding him to
  levy upon and sell the real and personal property of such person,  found
  within his county, for the payment of the amount thereof, with the added
  penalties, interest and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return
  such  warrant to the department of taxation and finance and to pay to it
  the money collected by  virtue  thereof  within  sixty  days  after  the
  receipt  of  such  warrant. The sheriff shall within five days after the
  receipt of the warrant, file  with  the  clerk  of  his  county  a  copy
  thereof,  and thereupon the clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the
  name of the person mentioned in the warrant, and the amount of the  tax,
  penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when
  such copy is filed, and thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed
  shall  become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal
  property of the person against whom the warrant  is  issued.  Such  lien
  shall  not  apply to personal property unless such warrant is also filed
  in the department of state. The said  sheriff  shall  thereupon  proceed
  upon  the  warrant  in  all  respects, with like effect, and in the same
  manner prescribed  by  law  in  respect  to  executions  issued  against
  property  upon  judgments of a court of record, and shall be entitled to
  the same fees for his services in executing the warrant, to be collected
  in the same manner. In the discretion of the tax commission a warrant of
  like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to  any  officer
  or  employee  of  the  department  of  taxation  and finance, and in the
  execution thereof such officer or employee shall  have  all  the  powers
  conferred  by  law  upon  sheriffs,  but  shall be entitled to no fee or
  compensation in excess of actual expenses paid  in  the  performance  of
  such  duty.  Upon such filing of a copy of a warrant, the tax commission
  shall have the same remedies to enforce the claim for  taxes,  penalties
  and  interest  against  any  person  as  if  the people of the state had
  recovered judgment against such person for the amount of the tax.
    3. Whenever any person is delinquent in the payment of any amount  due
  under this article the commission may forthwith collect such amount from
  such  person  by  seizing any motor vehicle or vehicular unit subject to
  the lien of the tax, which is owned by him or of which he has the lawful
  use or control and may thereafter sell  it  at  public  auction  in  the
  county  in  which  it  was  seized  to pay the fees, taxes, interest and
  penalties and any costs incurred on account of  the  seizure  and  sale,
  after giving ten days' notice of the sale in writing to such person and,
  where  such  person  is not the owner of such motor vehicle or vehicular
  unit, to the owner thereof provided that  he  has  filed  with  the  tax
  commission  a  statement  of  his  ownership  of  the  motor  vehicle or
  vehicular unit subject to the lien. Public notice of the time and  place
  of the sale of the property to be sold shall be given by posting same in
  at  least  six public places in the county where the sale is to be made,
  at least six days prior thereto. A copy of such notice shall be filed at
  least six days prior to the sale in  an  office  of  the  department  of


 taxation  and  finance in Albany to be designated by the tax commission,
  and shall be available for public inspection. The proceeds of such  sale
  shall  be paid into the state treasury to the credit of the general fund
  provided,  however, any excess received upon the sale over the amount of
  the fees, taxes, interest  and  penalties  and  any  costs  incurred  on
  account  of  the  seizure  and  sale shall be refunded to such person or
  owner.
    4. In addition to the foregoing proceedings, in case of default of any
  person to  pay,  within  the  time  limited  herein,  any  fees,  taxes,
  penalties  or  interest which he is required to pay under the provisions
  of this article or to file  a  bond,  other  security  or  a  return  as
  required  by  this  article or by the tax commission, the tax commission
  may forward a written statement of the facts showing such default to the
  department of motor vehicles which shall suspend all registration plates
  of all motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers, dollies or other devices
  of such person on account of such default,  which  suspension  shall  be
  terminated  if  the  commission certifies that such persons have paid or
  secured the above amounts, or filed the required bond or other security.
    5. The operation by a nonresident of a vehicular unit in this state or
  the operation in this state of a motor vehicle,  trailer,  semi-trailer,
  dolly  or other device owned by a nonresident shall be deemed equivalent
  to an appointment by such nonresident of the secretary of  state  to  be
  his  true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served the process in any
  action or proceeding against him growing out of any liability for  fees,
  taxes, penalties or interest under this article and such operation shall
  be deemed a signification of his agreement that any such process against
  him  which is so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as
  if served on him personally within the state and within the  territorial
  jurisdiction  of  the  court  from  which the process issues. Service of
  process shall be made by either (1) personally delivering to and leaving
  with the secretary of state or a deputy  secretary  of  state  duplicate
  copies  thereof  at the office of the department of state in the city of
  Albany, in which event the secretary of state shall  forthwith  send  by
  registered  mail  one  of  such  copies  to  the  person  at the address
  designated by him in his application for a certificate  of  registration
  under this article or in the last return filed by him under this article
  or as shown on the records of the commissioner, or if no application has
  been  filed,  at  his  last  known  office address within or without the
  state, or (2) personally delivering to and leaving with the secretary of
  state or a deputy secretary of state a copy thereof at the office of the
  department of state in the city of  Albany  and  by  delivering  a  copy
  thereof  to  the  person,  personally  without  the state. Proof of such
  personal service without the state shall be filed with the clerk of  the
  court  in  which  the  process  is pending within thirty days after such
  service and such service shall be complete ten days after proof  thereof
  is filed.






	   §  512.  Penalties  and  interest. 1. (a) Any person failing to file a
  return or to pay any tax within the time required by or pursuant to this
  article (determined with regard to any extension of time for  filing  or
  paying) shall be subject to a penalty of ten per centum of the amount of
  tax determined to be due as provided in this article plus one per centum
  of  such  amount  for  each  month or fraction thereof during which such
  failure continues after the expiration of the  first  month  after  such
  return  was  required  to be filed or such tax became due, not exceeding
  thirty per centum in the aggregate. Provided, however, that  any  person
  who  fails to file any return required by this article within sixty days
  of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
  to any extension of time for filing) shall be subject to a penalty which
  shall not be less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or one  hundred
  per centum of the amount required to be shown as tax on such return. For
  the  purpose of the preceding sentence, the amount of tax required to be
  shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any  part  of  the
  tax  which  is  paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the
  tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
  upon the return.
    (b) If any amount of tax is not  paid  on  or  before  the  last  date
  prescribed  in  this article for payment, interest on such amount at the
  underpayment rate set  by  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance
  pursuant  to subdivision twenty-sixth of section one hundred seventy-one
  of this chapter shall be paid for the period from such last date to  the
  date paid, whether or not any extension of time for payment was granted.
  Interest under this paragraph shall not be paid if the amount thereof is
  less than one dollar.
    (c)  If  the  tax commission determines that such failure or delay was
  due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, it  shall  remit
  all  or  part of such penalty. The tax commission shall promulgate rules
  and regulations as to what constitutes reasonable cause.
    (d) If the failure to pay any tax  within  the  time  required  by  or
  pursuant  to  this article is due to fraud, in lieu of the penalties and
  interest provided for in paragraphs (a) and  (b)  of  this  subdivision,
  there shall be added to the tax (i) a penalty of two times the amount of
  tax  due, plus (ii) interest on such unpaid tax at the underpayment rate
  set by the commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to  subdivision
  twenty-sixth  of section one hundred seventy-one of this chapter for the
  period beginning on the last day prescribed  by  this  article  for  the
  payment  of such tax (determined without regard to any extension of time
  for paying) and ending on the day on which such tax is paid.
    (e) In addition to any other penalty  imposed  by  this  chapter,  any
  person  who  fails  to  obtain a certificate of registration or decal as
  required under this article shall, after due notice and  an  opportunity
  for a hearing, for a first violation be liable for a civil fine not less
  than five hundred dollars but not to exceed two thousand dollars and for
  a  second  or  subsequent violation within three years following a prior
  finding of violation be liable for  a  civil  fine  not  less  than  one
  thousand dollars but not to exceed three thousand five hundred dollars.
    (f)  The  penalties  and interest imposed by this subdivision shall be
  assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as the taxes imposed  by
  this article. Interest under this subdivision shall be compounded daily.
    2.  For purposes of this chapter the failure to do any act required by
  or under the provisions of this article shall be deemed an act committed
  in part at the office of the  department  of  taxation  and  finance  in
  Albany.    For  purposes  of  this  chapter,  the certificate of the tax
  commission to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that a return has
  not been filed, or that information has not been supplied,  as  required


 by  or  under the provisions of this article, or that a claim for refund
  has been filed, shall be prima facie evidence that such tax has not been
  paid, that such return has not been filed, that such information has not
  been supplied, or that such claim has been filed.
    3.  Violations  of  this  article  may  be  prosecuted by the attorney
  general in the name of the people  of  the  state,  in  which  case  the
  attorney  general  shall  exercise  all  the  powers and perform all the
  duties which the district attorney  would  otherwise  be  authorized  to
  exercise or to perform therein.
    4.  Cross-reference:  For  criminal  penalties and other offenses, see
  article thirty-seven of this chapter.




   §  512-a.  Admissibility  of  weigh  slips.  An official weigh slip or
  ticket issued and certified by any truck weigher in the  employ  of  the
  department  of transportation or by any duly licensed weigh master shall
  constitute prima facie evidence of the information therein set forth and
  of the operation of the vehicle therein described upon a public  highway
  and shall be admissible before any court in any civil proceeding.




   §  513.  Refunds.  Whenever  the commissioner shall determine that any
  monies received under the provisions of this article were paid in error,
  he may cause the same to be refunded  or  credited,  with  interest,  in
  accordance  with  such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, except
  that no interest shall be allowed or paid if the amount thereof would be
  less than one dollar. Such interest shall be at the overpayment rate set
  by the commissioner pursuant to subdivision twenty-sixth of section  one
  hundred  seventy-one  of this chapter, or if no rate is set, at the rate
  of six percent per annum,  from  the  date  when  the  tax,  penalty  or
  interest  to  be  refunded  or credited was paid to a date preceding the
  date of the refund check by  not  more  than  thirty  days.    Provided,
  however,  that for the purposes of this section, any tax paid before the
  last day prescribed for its payment shall be deemed to have been paid on
  such last day. Such moneys received under the provisions of this article
  which the commissioner shall  determine  were  paid  in  error,  may  be
  refunded  or  credited out of funds in the custody of the comptroller to
  the credit of such taxes provided an application therefor is filed  with
  the  commissioner  within four years from the time the erroneous payment
  was made, except if an agreement under the provisions  of  section  five
  hundred  ten  (extending  the period for determination of tax imposed by
  this article) is made within the four-year period for the filing  of  an
  application  for  refund  provided  for  in this section, the period for
  filing an application for refund shall not expire prior  to  six  months
  after  the  expiration of the period within which a determination may be
  made pursuant to the agreement or any extension thereof.




   §  514.  Secrecy  of  returns.  1.  Except  in  accordance with proper
  judicial order or as in this section or otherwise provided  by  law,  it
  shall  be  unlawful  for  the  tax commission, any tax commissioner, any
  officer or employee of the department of taxation and  finance,  or  any
  officer or person who, pursuant to this section, is permitted to inspect
  any  return or report or to whom a copy, an abstract or a portion of any
  return or report is furnished, or to whom any information  contained  in
  any  return or report is furnished, or any person engaged or retained by
  such department on an independent contract basis, or any person  who  in
  any  manner  may acquire knowledge of the contents of a return or report
  filed pursuant to this article, to divulge or make known in  any  manner
  the  contents  or  any  other  information relating to the business of a
  carrier or other person contained in any return or report required under
  this article. The officers charged with the custody of such  returns  or
  reports  shall  not  be  required  to produce any of them or evidence of
  anything contained in them in any action or  proceeding  in  any  court,
  except  on  behalf of the state, the department of taxation and finance,
  the department of transportation or the tax commission in an  action  or
  proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, the vehicle and traffic
  law  or  the  transportation  law,  or on behalf of the state or the tax
  commission in any other action or proceeding involving the collection of
  a tax due under this chapter to which the state or the tax commission is
  a party or a claimant or on  behalf  of  any  party  to  any  action  or
  proceeding  under  the  provisions  of  this  article or the vehicle and
  traffic law or the transportation law when the returns or the reports or
  the facts  shown  thereby  are  directly  involved  in  such  action  or
  proceeding, or on behalf of officers to whom information shall have been
  supplied as provided in subdivision two of this section, in any of which
  events  the  court  may  require  the  production  of,  and may admit in
  evidence so much of said returns  or  reports  or  of  the  facts  shown
  thereby  as  are  pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. The
  tax commission may, nevertheless, publish a copy or  a  summary  of  any
  decision  rendered after the formal hearing provided for in section five
  hundred ten of this  chapter.  Nothing  herein  shall  be  construed  to
  prohibit  the  tax  commission,  in  its  discretion,  from allowing the
  inspection or delivery of a certified copy of any return or report filed
  under this article or of any information contained in any such return or
  report by or to a duly authorized officer or employee of the  department
  of  transportation,  or  by  or  to  the attorney general or other legal
  representatives of the state when an action shall have been  recommended
  or commenced pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the vehicle and
  traffic  law  or the transportation law in which such returns or reports
  or the facts shown thereby are directly involved; or the  inspection  of
  the returns or reports required under this article by the comptroller or
  duly designated officer or employee of the state department of audit and
  control,  for  purposes  of the audit of a refund of any tax paid by any
  person under this article; nor to prohibit the delivery to  any  person,
  or  a  duly authorized representative of such person of a certified copy
  of any return or report filed by such person pursuant to  this  article,
  nor  to  prohibit  the  publication  of  statistics  so classified as to
  prevent the identification of particular  returns  or  reports  and  the
  items  thereof;  nor  to  prohibit  the  publication of delinquent lists
  showing the names of taxpayers who have failed to pay their taxes at the
  time and in the manner provided by section  five  hundred  six  of  this
  chapter,  together with any relevant information which in the opinion of
  the tax commission may assist  in  the  collection  of  such  delinquent
  taxes.  Returns  and  reports  shall  be  preserved  for four years, and
  thereafter until the tax commission orders them to be destroyed.


   2. The tax commission, in its discretion and pursuant  to  such  rules
  and regulations as it may adopt, may permit the commissioner of internal
  revenue  of  the United States, or the appropriate officers of any other
  state which imposes a similar highway use tax, or  the  duly  authorized
  representatives of such commissioner or of any such officers, to inspect
  returns or reports made pursuant to this article, or may furnish to such
  commissioner  or  other  officers, or duly authorized representatives, a
  copy of any such return or report or  an  abstract  of  the  information
  therein   contained,   or  any  portion  thereof,  or  may  supply  such
  commissioner  or  any  such  officers  or  such   representatives   with
  information  relating  to  the  business of any person making returns or
  reports hereunder. The tax commission may refuse to  supply  information
  pursuant  to this subdivision to the commissioner of internal revenue of
  the United States or to the officers of any other state if the  statutes
  of  the  United States, or of the state represented by such officers, do
  not grant substantially similar privileges to the tax commission of this
  state, but such refusal shall not be mandatory. Information shall not be
  supplied to the commissioner of internal revenue of the United States or
  the appropriate officers of any other  state  which  imposes  a  similar
  highway  use  tax,  or  the  duly  authorized  representatives  of  such
  commissioner or of any  of  such  officers,  unless  such  commissioner,
  officer  or  other  representatives  shall  agree not to divulge or make
  known in any manner the information so supplied, but such  officers  may
  transmit  such  information  to their employees or legal representatives
  when necessary, who in turn shall be subject to the same restrictions as
  those  hereby  imposed  upon  such  commissioner,   officer   or   other
  representatives.
    3. (a) Any officer or employee of the state who willfully violates the
  provisions  of subdivision one or two of this section shall be dismissed
  from office and be barred from holding any public office in  this  state
  for a period of five years thereafter.
    (b)  Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see article thirty-seven
  of this chapter.
    4. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one of this  section,
  the  tax commission, in its discretion, may require or permit any or all
  persons or carriers liable for any tax or fee imposed by  this  article,
  to  make  payment of any tax, fee, penalty or interest to banks, banking
  houses or trust companies designated by the tax commission and  to  file
  returns  and  reports with such banks, banking houses or trust companies
  as agents of the tax commission, in lieu  of  making  any  such  payment
  directly  to  the  tax  commission.  However,  the  tax commission shall
  designate only such banks, banking houses or trust companies as  are  or
  shall  be  designated  by  the  comptroller  as depositories pursuant to
  section five hundred fifteen.
    5. Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  this  section:  (a)  Upon
  agreement  with  the  heads  of  the  department  of motor vehicles, the
  department  of   transportation,   the   department   of   environmental
  conservation,  the  division of state police, the thruway authority, the
  United States  department  of  transportation,  and  the  United  States
  department  of  homeland security (or any other federal agency which may
  assume the duties of either or  both  of  such  federal  agencies),  the
  commissioner  may  disclose to such agencies the name, address, employer
  identification number, vehicle identification number, application status
  information,  and  other   appropriate   identifying   and   application
  information,  of  persons  holding  a  certification  of registration or
  license under this article, persons whose certificate of registration or
  license under this article has been revoked, suspended  or  surrendered,
  and  persons  whose  application  for  a  certificate of registration or


 license under  this  article  has  been  denied,  for  the  purposes  of
  improving  the  safety  and  security  oversight  of  the  motor carrier
  industry and coordinating and streamlining the credentialing process for
  such industry administered by such agencies.
    (b)   Any  information  disclosed  by  the  commissioner  pursuant  to
  paragraph (a) of this subdivision may, pursuant to  such  agreement,  be
  re-disclosed  by  and  among  the heads of such agencies and may also be
  re-disclosed to the heads of comparable agencies of any other state, the
  District  of  Columbia  or  any  province  or  territory  of  Canada  in
  furtherance of the purposes specified in this subdivision.
    6.  (a)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision one of this
  section, upon written request from the chairperson of the  committee  on
  ways  and  means  of  the  United  States  House of Representatives, the
  chairperson of the committee on finance of the United States Senate,  or
  the  chairperson of the joint committee on taxation of the United States
  Congress, the commissioner shall furnish such committee with any current
  or prior year returns or reports specified in  such  request  that  were
  filed  under  this  article  by  the  president  of  the  United States,
  vice-president of  the  United  States,  member  of  the  United  States
  Congress representing New York state, or any person who served in or was
  employed  by the executive branch of the government of the United States
  on the executive staff of the president, in the executive office of  the
  president,  or  in an acting or confirmed capacity in a position subject
  to confirmation by the United States senate; or, in New  York  state:  a
  statewide  elected  official, as defined in paragraph (a) of subdivision
  one of section seventy-three-a of  the  public  officers  law;  a  state
  officer  or employee, as defined in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (c) of
  subdivision one of  such  section  seventy-three-a;  a  political  party
  chairperson,  as  defined  in  paragraph  (h) of subdivision one of such
  section  seventy-three-a;  a  local  elected  official,  as  defined  in
  subdivisions  one  and  two  of section eight hundred ten of the general
  municipal law; a person appointed, pursuant to  law,  to  serve  due  to
  vacancy  or  otherwise  in  the position of a local elected official, as
  defined in subdivisions one and two of section eight hundred ten of  the
  general  municipal law; a member of the state legislature; or a judge or
  justice of the unified court system; or filed by  a  partnership,  firm,
  association,  corporation,  joint-stock company, trust or similar entity
  directly or indirectly controlled  by  any  individual  listed  in  this
  paragraph,  whether  by  contract,  through  ownership  or  control of a
  majority  interest  in  such  entity,  or  otherwise,  or  filed  by   a
  partnership,  firm, association, corporation, joint-stock company, trust
  or similar entity of which any individual listed in this paragraph holds
  ten percent or more of the voting securities of  such  entity;  provided
  however that, prior to furnishing any return or report, the commissioner
  shall  redact any copy of a federal return (or portion thereof) attached
  to, or any information on a federal return that is  reflected  on,  such
  return  or  report, and any social security numbers, account numbers and
  residential address information.
    (b) No  returns  or  reports  shall  be  furnished  pursuant  to  this
  subdivision unless the chairperson of the requesting committee certifies
  in  writing that such returns or reports have been requested related to,
  and in furtherance of, a legitimate  task  of  the  Congress,  that  the
  requesting  committee  has  made  a written request to the United States
  secretary of the treasury for related  federal  returns  or  reports  or
  return or report information, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 6103(f), and
  that  if  such  requested  returns  or  reports  are inspected by and/or
  submitted  to  another  committee,  to  the  United  States   House   of
  Representatives,  or  to  the United States Senate, then such inspection


 and/or submission shall occur in a manner consistent with federal law as
  informed by the requirements and procedures  established  in  26  U.S.C.
  Section 6103(f).




   §  514-a. Mailing rules; holidays. 1. If any return, claim, statement,
  notice, application, or other document required  to  be  filed,  or  any
  payment  required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before
  a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this  article  is,
  after  such  period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the
  tax commission, bureau, office, officer or person  with  which  or  with
  whom  such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such
  payment is required to be made, the date of the United  States  postmark
  stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This
  subdivision  shall  apply  only  if  the  postmark date falls within the
  prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing  of
  such  document,  or  for  making  the  payment,  including any extension
  granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment
  was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly  addressed  to  the
  tax  commission,  bureau,  office,  officer or person with which or with
  whom the document is required to be filed or to which or  to  whom  such
  payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States
  registered  mail,  such  registration shall be prima facie evidence that
  such document was delivered  to  the  tax  commission,  bureau,  office,
  officer  or person to which or to whom addressed. To the extent that the
  tax commission shall prescribe by regulation, certified mail may be used
  in lieu of registered mail under this section.  This  subdivision  shall
  apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States Post Office
  only if and to the extent provided by regulations of the tax commission.
    2.  When  the  last  day  prescribed  under  authority of this article
  (including any extension of  time)  for  performing  any  act  falls  on
  Saturday,  Sunday  or  a  legal  holiday  in  the state of New York, the
  performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on
  the next succeeding day which is not  a  Saturday,  Sunday  or  a  legal
  holiday.
    3.  (a) Any reference in subdivision one of this section to the United
  States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
  service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
  pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred two of the internal revenue
  code and any reference in subdivision one of this section to a  postmark
  by  the  United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to
  any  date  recorded  or  marked  in  the  manner  described  in  section
  seventy-five  hundred  two  of the internal revenue code by a designated
  delivery service.  If the commissioner finds that any  delivery  service
  designated  by  such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the state,
  the commissioner may withdraw such  designation  for  purposes  of  this
  article.    The  commissioner  may  also  designate  additional delivery
  services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the
  internal revenue code for purposes of this article, or may withdraw  any
  such  designation  if  the commissioner finds that a delivery service so
  designated is inadequate for the needs of the state.   Any reference  in
  subdivision  one  of  this  section  to  the United States mail shall be
  treated as including a reference to any delivery service  designated  by
  the commissioner and any reference in subdivision one of this section to
  a  postmark  by  the  United States mail shall be treated as including a
  reference to any date recorded or marked  in  the  manner  described  in
  section  seventy-five  hundred  two  of  the  internal revenue code by a
  delivery service designated by the commissioner.
    (b) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated  by  the
  United  States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the
  commissioner pursuant to the same criteria used  by  the  secretary  for
  such  designations  pursuant  to section seventy-five hundred two of the
  internal  revenue  code,  shall  be  included  within  the  meaning   of


 registered or certified mail as used in subdivision one of this section.
  If the commissioner finds that any equivalent of registered or certified
  mail  designated by such secretary or the commissioner is inadequate for
  the  needs  of the state, the commissioner may withdraw such designation
  for purposes of this article.




   §  515.  Disposition  of  revenues. All taxes, interest, penalties and
  fees collected or received pursuant to this article shall  be  deposited
  daily  in  one  account  with  such responsible banks, banking houses or
  trust companies as may be designated by  the  comptroller,  and  to  the
  credit of the comptroller on account of the dedicated highway and bridge
  trust  fund  established  pursuant to section eighty-nine-b of the state
  finance law. Such an account may be established in one or more  of  such
  depositories and such deposits shall be kept separate and apart from all
  other moneys in the possession of the comptroller. The comptroller shall
  require adequate security from all such depositories.
    Of  the  revenues  so  deposited,  the comptroller shall retain in his
  hands such amount as  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  may
  determine  to  be  necessary  for refunds or reimbursements of the taxes
  collected or received pursuant to this article to which taxpayers  shall
  be  entitled  under  the provisions of this article, out of which amount
  the comptroller shall pay any refunds or  reimbursements  of  the  taxes
  collected  or received pursuant to this article to which taxpayers shall
  be entitled under such provisions. The comptroller, after reserving  the
  amount  to  pay  such refunds or reimbursements, shall, on or before the
  last day of each month, pay the balance  of  the  revenue  so  deposited
  during  such  month  into  the  dedicated  highway and bridge trust fund
  established pursuant to section eighty-nine-b of the state finance law.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other law to  the  contrary,  the
  comptroller  shall  deposit  all  monies  collected  on  account  of the
  registration fees imposed pursuant to section  five  hundred  two-a  and
  subdivision  eight of section five hundred nine of this article into the
  highway use tax administration account established pursuant  to  section
  ninety-nine-y  of  the  state  finance law. The monies deposited in such
  account shall be available to the commissioner for the costs of  issuing
  the  certificates of registration and highway use tax decals required by
  this article and for any other costs of administering the provisions  of
  sections  five  hundred two, five hundred two-a and five hundred nine of
  this article. Any moneys not used in a given year shall be  returned  to
  such  account and be added to the total funds available for disbursement
  in the succeeding year.

  under this section or, if the commissioner  enters  into  a  cooperative
  agreement pursuant to section five hundred twenty-eight of this article,
  the  license  and  decal  authorizing  such  operation  pursuant to such
  agreement.
    (c) Denial, suspension and revocation. The  commissioner,  for  cause,
  may  deny  a license and suspend or revoke any license issued under this
  section, after an opportunity  for  a  hearing  has  been  afforded  the
  carrier;  provided,  however,  that a license may be denied or it may be
  suspended or revoked for failure to file a return as  required  pursuant
  to this article or for nonpayment of moneys due under this article prior
  to  a  hearing.  A violation of any of the provisions of this article or
  article twenty-one of this chapter or of any rule or regulation  of  the
  commissioner  promulgated  under this article or such article twenty-one
  shall  constitute  sufficient  cause  for  the  denial,  suspension   or
  revocation  of a license. In addition, if the commissioner enters into a
  cooperative agreement with other jurisdictions pursuant to section  five
  hundred  twenty-eight  of  this  article,  the  commissioner may deny an
  application for  license  where  a  license  previously  issued  to  the
  applicant  is  under suspension or revocation by any member jurisdiction
  and a license may be revoked or suspended for  failure  to  comply  with
  such agreement. A denial, revocation or suspension of a license shall be
  final  unless  the applicant or licensee shall, within thirty days after
  the giving of notice of such denial, revocation or suspension,  petition
  the  division  of  tax  appeals for a hearing in accordance with article
  forty of this chapter. If the commissioner  enters  into  a  cooperative
  agreement  pursuant to such section five hundred twenty-eight, notice of
  a hearing shall be given and a hearing held within any time restrictions
  prescribed in such agreement.
    (d) Trip permits. In lieu of the license and  decal  provided  for  in
  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section,  any carrier, except as hereinafter
  limited, may apply to  the  commissioner  for  a  trip  permit  for  any
  qualified  motor vehicle to be operated by him on the public highways of
  this state. Application for the trip permit shall  be  made  on  a  form
  prescribed by the commissioner and shall contain such information as the
  commissioner  shall  require.  The application shall be accompanied by a
  fee of twenty-five dollars for each qualified motor vehicle.  Each  trip
  permit shall be valid for a period of seventy-two hours from the time of


 its  issuance.  The  issuance  of  a  trip  permit for a qualified motor
  vehicle shall exempt the carrier from the requirement of filing  returns
  and  payment  of  the  taxes  imposed  by this article and section three
  hundred  one-h  of this chapter on the operation of such qualified motor
  vehicle for the effective period of the permit but no refund application
  may be filed on account of trip permit applications. Provided,  however,
  that in order for any person liable for the tax to claim such exemption,
  such person must retain a copy of the trip permit in his records for the
  complete  period  of time required by section five hundred seven of this
  chapter. A carrier may not apply for more than ten  trip  permits  under
  this section during a single calendar year.
    (e)  Motor vehicle registration. If the license covering any qualified
  motor vehicle has been suspended or  revoked  under  this  section,  the
  department  of  motor  vehicles  shall  not  thereafter  reregister  the
  qualified motor  vehicle  or  transfer  the  registration  of  ownership
  thereof  upon  the records of the department until there is furnished to
  such department a certificate issued by the commissioner to  the  effect
  that the carrier has fully complied with the provisions of this article.
  On  and  after  the  date  tax  is  first  imposed  by this article, the
  department of motor  vehicles  shall  not  reregister  or  transfer  the
  registered ownership of any qualified motor vehicle covered by a license
  under  this  article until there is furnished to it a certificate of tax
  clearance issued by the commissioner. Such certificate shall  be  issued
  after  the  payment  of all monies known to be due under this article or
  after the payment of any such amount is secured to the  satisfaction  of
  the commissioner.
    (f)  Construction  regarding  vehicle  and traffic law. Nothing herein
  contained shall be construed as authorizing motor vehicle weight  limits
  in excess of those permitted by the vehicle and traffic law.




   §  523.  Fuel  use tax. (a) Imposition. There is hereby imposed on and
  after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-six a tax on fuel  use  for
  the  privilege  of operating any qualified motor vehicle upon the public
  highways of this state.
    (b) Rate of tax. The tax  imposed  by  this  section  shall  be  at  a
  composite  rate  determined  by adding together (1) a fuel tax component
  which shall be equal to the applicable rate per gallon in  effect  under
  the  taxes  on  motor  fuel  and  diesel  motor  fuel imposed by article
  twelve-A of this chapter and (2) a sales tax component, which  shall  be
  equal  to  the  sum  of  (A)  a  state  sales  and  compensating use tax
  subcomponent, equal to the applicable rate per gallon  in  effect  under
  the sales and compensating use taxes on motor fuel and diesel motor fuel
  imposed  by  sections eleven hundred five and eleven hundred ten of this
  chapter as described in subdivision (m) of section eleven hundred eleven
  of this chapter  plus  (B)  a  local  sales  and  compensating  use  tax
  subcomponent, which shall be the lower of (i) the lowest applicable rate
  per  gallon in effect under the sales and compensating use taxes on such
  fuels in effect in any county of this state imposing a local  sales  and
  compensating  use  tax  on  a  cents  per  gallon  basis pursuant to the
  authority of subpart B of  part  one  of  article  twenty-nine  of  this
  chapter,  or  (ii)  the  equivalent rate per gallon based on the highest
  rate applicable to the receipts from the sale of a gallon of motor  fuel
  or  diesel motor fuel in effect in any locality of this state imposing a
  local sales and compensating use tax on a percentage rate basis  on  the
  sale  of  motor  fuel and diesel motor fuel pursuant to the authority of
  subpart B of part one of article twenty-nine of this chapter.  Provided,
  however,  that the total rate per gallon applicable to the receipts from
  the sale of a  gallon  of  such  fuels  imposed  under  clause  (ii)  of
  subparagraph  (B)  of paragraph two of this subdivision shall not exceed
  three percent. Such equivalent rate per  gallon  under  clause  (ii)  of
  subparagraph  B of paragraph two of this subdivision shall be determined
  as provided in subdivision (d) or (m) of section eleven  hundred  eleven
  of  this  chapter  and  the  schedules  prescribed  by  the commissioner
  pursuant to such subdivision (d), and shall  be  based  on  the  average
  price  per  gallon  (including all federal and state and any local taxes
  included in such price or imposed on the  use  or  consumption  of  such
  fuels  upon  which  the state and local sales and compensating use taxes
  are computed but determined without the inclusion of any state or  local
  sales  tax  on  receipts  from  sales of such fuels) paid by the carrier
  during the reporting period for all motor fuel  and  diesel  motor  fuel
  purchased for use in its operations either within or without this state.
  For purposes of clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph two of this
  subdivision, the price for motor fuel and diesel motor fuel purchased by
  such  carrier  shall be deemed to be the prevailing price for motor fuel
  and diesel motor fuel, as established by the commissioner each  calendar
  quarter  pursuant  to  this section, applicable to the reporting period.
  The commissioner shall for each calendar quarter establish a  prevailing
  price  for  motor  fuel  and diesel motor fuel based on the prices being
  charged on any given day during the first fifteen days of  the  previous
  calendar  quarter  at  a  minimum  of  ten  selected  truck stops widely
  scattered throughout the state. The tax imposed by this section shall be
  computed by multiplying such composite rate by the amount of motor  fuel
  or  diesel  motor  fuel,  as  the  case may be, used by a carrier in its
  operations within this state during each reporting period. The amount of
  motor fuel and diesel motor fuel used in the operations of  any  carrier
  within  this  state  shall be determined by dividing the number of miles
  traveled in this state subject to tax under this section by the  average
  miles  per gallon for the type of fuel. Where the records of any carrier


 are inadequate or incomplete, the qualified motor vehicles of a  carrier
  filing  returns  shall  be  deemed to have consumed, on the average, one
  gallon of diesel motor fuel for every four miles traveled or one  gallon
  of motor fuel for every three miles traveled unless substantial evidence
  discloses  that a different amount was consumed; provided, however, that
  if the commissioner enters into  a  cooperative  agreement  pursuant  to
  section  five  hundred  twenty-eight  of this article and such agreement
  prescribes a different average miles per gallon deemed to  be  consumed,
  the commissioner shall prescribe such different average.




   §  524.  Credits  and refunds. (a) Purchases. Every carrier subject to
  the tax imposed by this article shall be entitled to  a  credit  against
  such  tax  determined by adding together the following components: (1) a
  fuel tax component computed by multiplying  the  number  of  gallons  of
  motor  fuel  or  diesel motor fuel purchased by such carrier within this
  state in a return period, for use in its  operations  either  within  or
  without  this  state,  by the applicable rate per gallon imposed on such
  fuel under article twelve-A  of  this  chapter;  provided,  however,  no
  credit  shall  be  allowed  unless  the  tax  imposed under such article
  twelve-A upon such purchase of fuel has been paid by such  carrier,  and
  (2)  a sales tax component computed by multiplying the number of gallons
  of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel purchased by such carrier within this
  state in a return period, for use in its operations  within  or  without
  this state by the applicable rate per gallon of the sales tax component;
  provided,  however,  such  credit shall not exceed the tax imposed under
  article twenty-eight or pursuant to the authority of article twenty-nine
  of this chapter upon such purchase of fuel that has  been  paid  by  the
  carrier.   Each carrier claiming such credit components shall furnish to
  the  commissioner  such  evidence  of  payment  of  such  taxes  as  the
  commissioner  may  require.  When  the amount of the credit to which any
  carrier is entitled for any return period exceeds the amount of tax  for
  which  such carrier is liable under this article for such return period,
  such excess shall be allowed as a credit against the tax for which  such
  carrier  would  otherwise  be  liable  for the eight succeeding calendar
  quarters following the end of the reporting period from which the excess
  was derived or, if a claim for refund is filed on or before the last day
  of the month immediately following the four-year period commencing  with
  the  end  of  the reporting period for which such excess is derived, the
  amount of such excess for such period shall be refunded.
    (b) Transition. Every carrier subject  to  the  tax  imposed  by  this
  article  shall  be  entitled  to  a  credit against the tax equal to the
  credit determined  under  subdivision  three  of  section  five  hundred
  three-a  of  this  chapter which the carrier would have been entitled to
  carry forward against the tax  imposed  by  such  section  but  for  the
  termination  of  such  tax.  Such  credit may be applied against the tax
  imposed by this section or refunded, subject to the limitations provided
  in subdivision (a) of this section. A person  not  subject  to  the  tax
  imposed  by  this  article  may apply for a refund of such excess credit
  which such person would have been entitled to carry forward against  the
  tax imposed by such section five hundred three-a but for the termination
  of  such  tax, subject to the limitations provided in subdivision (a) of
  this section.
    (c) Actual price.  Every  carrier  which  can  substantiate  that  its
  average  price  paid per gallon (including all federal and state and any
  local taxes included in such price or imposed on the use or  consumption
  of  such fuels upon which the state and local sales and compensating use
  taxes are computed but determined with out the inclusion of any state or
  local sales tax on receipts from sales of such fuels) during a reporting
  period is less than the prevailing  price  determined  for  such  period
  pursuant to subdivision (b) of section five hundred twenty-three of this
  article,  if  such calculation was based upon an amount determined under
  clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph two of subdivision  (b)  of
  section  five  hundred  twenty-three  of  this  article, may apply for a
  refund of the difference between the tax paid relating to the sales  tax
  component  computed based upon such prevailing price for such period and
  the tax relating to the sales tax  component  computed  based  upon  the
  carrier's  actual  average  purchase  price for such period. Such refund
  must be applied for on or before the last day of the  month  immediately


 following  the four-year period commencing with the end of the reporting
  period which gave rise to the refund.
    (d)  Erroneous payment. Whenever the commissioner shall determine that
  any moneys received under the provisions of this article  were  paid  in
  error,  he  or  she  may cause the same to be refunded or credited. Such
  moneys  received  under  the  provisions  of  this  article  which   the
  commissioner  shall  determine  were  paid  in error, may be refunded or
  credited out of funds in the custody of the comptroller to the credit of
  such  taxes  provided  an  application  therefor  is  filed   with   the
  commissioner  within  four years from the time the erroneous payment was
  made, except if an  agreement  under  the  provisions  of  section  five
  hundred  ten  of  this  chapter as made applicable to the tax imposed by
  this article by  section  five  hundred  twenty-eight  of  this  article
  (extending  the period for determination of tax imposed by this article)
  is made within the four-year period for the filing of an application for
  refund provided for in  this  subdivision,  the  period  for  filing  an
  application  for  refund  shall not expire prior to six months after the
  expiration of the period  within  which  a  determination  may  be  made
  pursuant to the agreement or any extension thereof.
    (e)  Determination  and review. The commissioner shall grant or deny a
  claim for refund under this section in whole or in part and shall notify
  the  claimant  by  mail  of  the  commissioner's   determination.   Such
  determination  shall be final and irrevocable unless the claimant shall,
  within thirty days after the mailing of notice  of  such  determination,
  petition  the division of tax appeals for a hearing. If the commissioner
  enters into a cooperative agreement pursuant  to  section  five  hundred
  twenty-eight  of  this article, notice of a hearing shall be given and a
  hearing held within any time restrictions prescribed in such  agreement.
  After such hearing, the division of tax appeals shall mail notice of the
  determination of the administrative law judge to the claimant and to the
  commissioner.  Such  determination  may  be  reviewed by the tax appeals
  tribunal as provided in article forty of this chapter. The  decision  of
  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  may  be reviewed as provided in section two
  thousand sixteen of this chapter. However, such a proceeding may not  be
  commenced  unless  an undertaking is filed with the commissioner in such
  amount and with such sureties as a justice of the  supreme  court  shall
  approve  to  the  effect  that  if  the  proceeding  be dismissed or the
  decision confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges  which
  may accrue against him in the prosecution of the proceeding.




   §  525.  Exemptions. (a) General. The provisions of this article shall
  not apply to any qualified motor vehicle:
    (1) Which is a road roller, tractor crane, truck crane, power  shovel,
  road  building  machine,  snow plow, road sweeper, sand spreader or well
  driller.
    (2) Which is described in section five hundred four of  this  chapter,
  except subdivision four of such section.
    (b)  Omnibus carriers. (1) An omnibus carrier shall not be required to
  apply for a license and decal or decals for a  qualified  motor  vehicle
  which  is an omnibus operated on a public highway in this state; except,
  if  the  commissioner  enters  into  a   cooperative   agreement   under
  subdivision  (b)  of  section five hundred twenty-eight of this article,
  the commissioner may, pursuant to such agreement, require such a carrier
  to be licensed and obtain such decal or decals with respect  to  such  a
  vehicle.
    (2)  The  taxes  imposed by this article shall not apply to motor fuel
  and diesel motor fuel used by an omnibus carrier in the operation of  an
  omnibus  in  local  transit  service  in  this state, as described under
  paragraph (d) of subdivision three of section two hundred  eighty-nine-c
  of  this  chapter,  pursuant  to a certificate of public convenience and
  necessity issued by the commissioner of transportation of this state  or
  by  the  interstate commerce commission of the United States or pursuant
  to a contract, franchise or consent between  such  carrier  and  a  city
  having  a population of more than one million inhabitants, or any agency
  of such city.
    (c) Effect of cooperative agreement. Notwithstanding subdivisions  (a)
  and  (b) of this section, in the event that the commissioner enters into
  a cooperative agreement under subdivision (b) of  section  five  hundred
  twenty-eight  of  this article, the commissioner may issue a license and
  decal or decals with respect to qualified motor  vehicles  described  in
  subdivisions  (a)  and (b) of this section which are based in this state
  for the purpose of reporting and payment of tax imposed by other  member
  jurisdictions with respect to such qualified motor vehicles.




   §  526. Returns and payment of tax. (a) Returns. Every carrier subject
  to this article and every carrier to whom a  license  was  issued  shall
  file a return quarterly, on or before the last day of the calendar month
  immediately  following  the  close  of  each  of  the calendar quarters:
  January through March, April through June, July  through  September  and
  October  through  December.  Provided, however, the commissioner may, if
  the commissioner deems it necessary in order to insure  the  payment  of
  the  taxes  imposed  by  this  article  or  to comply with a cooperative
  agreement with other jurisdictions  pursuant  to  section  five  hundred
  twenty-eight  of  this article, require returns to be made at such times
  and covering such  periods  as  the  commissioner  may  deem  necessary.
  Returns  shall  be  filed on forms required by the commissioner for such
  purpose and shall contain such  information  and  certification  as  the
  commissioner may require, including any information required pursuant to
  a cooperative agreement pursuant to section five hundred twenty-eight of
  this  article.  The  fact that an individual's name is signed to a filed
  return shall be prima facie evidence for all purposes  that  the  return
  was  actually  signed  by  such  individual  and that such individual is
  authorized to sign on behalf of the carrier.
    (b) Payment of tax. At the time of filing a  return,  as  required  by
  this article, each carrier shall pay the tax imposed by this article for
  the  period covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at
  the time of filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due,  on
  the last day on which the return is required to be filed.
    (c)  Extensions.  The commissioner may grant a reasonable extension of
  time for filing returns or paying the tax whenever good cause exists and
  may waive the filing of returns if a carrier is not subject to  the  tax
  imposed by this article for the period covered by the return.
    (d)  Leases.  In those instances where the carrier is not the owner of
  the qualified motor vehicle, the owner may be licensed and file  returns
  and  maintain  records  pursuant  to  this  article as prescribed by the
  commissioner or, if the commissioner enters into a cooperative agreement
  under section five hundred twenty-eight of this article,  as  prescribed
  in such agreement. In any event, where the carrier is not the owner of a
  qualified motor vehicle, the owner shall be jointly and severally liable
  with  the  carrier for payment of tax under this article with respect to
  such qualified motor vehicle.




   § 527. Interest and penalty. (a) Interest on tax due. If any amount of
  tax  is  not  paid on or before the last date prescribed in this article
  for payment (determined without regard to  any  extension  of  time  for
  payment),  interest  on such amount at the rate of one percent per month
  or fraction thereof shall be paid for the period from such last date  to
  the date paid.
    (b)  Penalty.  Any  person  failing to file a return or to pay any tax
  within the time required by or pursuant to this article (determined with
  regard to any extension of time for filing or paying) shall  be  subject
  to  a  penalty  of  fifty  dollars  or  ten percent of the amount of tax
  determined  to  be  due,  whichever  is  greater.  If  the  commissioner
  determines that the failure or delay was due to reasonable cause and not
  due to willful neglect, the commissioner shall waive all or part of such
  penalty.
    (c)  Interest  on  refunds.  Interest  at  the  rate  determined under
  subdivision (a) of this section shall be paid with respect to  a  refund
  claim  for the period ninety days after receipt of a claim for refund in
  processible form to the date  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the
  refund  check.  No  interest shall be paid if the check is mailed within
  ninety days of such receipt.
    (d) Fraud. If the failure to pay any tax within the time  required  by
  or  pursuant  to  this article is due to fraud, in lieu of the penalties
  provided for in subdivision (b) of this section, there shall be added to
  the tax (1) a penalty of two times the amount of tax due.
    (e) Enforcement of penalty and interest. The  penalties  and  interest
  imposed  by or pursuant to this section shall be assessed, collected and
  paid in the same manner as the taxes imposed by this article.
    (f)  Cooperative  agreement.  If  the  commissioner  enters   into   a
  cooperative  agreement  pursuant to section five hundred twenty-eight of
  this article and:  (1)  this  state  is  thereby  authorized  to  impose
  penalties  on  taxes collected on behalf of other jurisdictions pursuant
  to such agreement, then the penalties  imposed  by  this  section  shall
  apply  with  respect  to  such  taxes;  (2) the rates of interest or any
  penalty or the method of computation contained therein is different from
  that  prescribed  in  this  section  or  the  imposition  of  a  penalty
  prescribed  in  this  section  is  precluded by such agreement, then the
  provisions of such agreement shall apply.
    (g) Location of acts; evidence.  For  purposes  of  this  chapter  the
  failure  to  do  any  act  required  by  or under the provisions of this
  article shall be deemed an act committed in part at the  office  of  the
  department  of  taxation  and  finance  in  Albany. For purposes of this
  chapter, the certificate of the commissioner to the effect  that  a  tax
  has not been paid, that a return has not been filed, or that information
  has  not  been  supplied, as required by or under the provisions of this
  article, or that a claim for refund has been filed, shall be prima facie
  evidence that such tax has not been paid, that such return has not  been
  filed,  that  such information has not been supplied, or that such claim
  has been filed.
    (h) Prosecution. Violations of this article may be prosecuted  by  the
  attorney  general  in the name of the people of the state, in which case
  the attorney general shall exercise  all  powers  and  perform  all  the
  duties  which  the  district  attorney  would otherwise be authorized to
  exercise or to perform therein.
    (i) Cross-reference. For criminal penalties and  other  offenses,  see
  article thirty-seven of this chapter.




   §  528.  Procedure,  administration  and  disposition of revenues. (a)
  General. The provisions of subdivision two of section five  hundred  six
  and  sections  five  hundred  seven through five hundred fifteen of this
  chapter (excluding sections five hundred eight, five hundred twelve  and
  five  hundred  thirteen)  shall  apply to the provisions of this article
  with the same force and effect as if the language  of  such  subdivision
  and  sections  had  been  incorporated in full into this article and had
  expressly referred to the tax under this article, except to  the  extent
  that  any  such provision is either inconsistent with or not relevant to
  this article or inconsistent with a provision of any agreement which the
  commissioner enters into pursuant to subdivision (b)  of  this  section,
  with such modification as may be necessary to adapt the language of such
  provisions  to  the  tax  imposed  by  this  article,  provided that (1)
  notwithstanding such section five hundred ten and  subdivision  four  of
  section  two  thousand six of this chapter, a determination, as provided
  in such section five hundred ten, relating to the tax  imposed  by  this
  article,  shall finally and conclusively fix such tax, unless the person
  against whom it is assessed shall, within thirty days after  the  giving
  of  notice  of  such determination, petition the division of tax appeals
  for a hearing, or unless the  commissioner  on  the  commissioner's  own
  motion  shall  redetermine the same; (2) the term "vehicular unit" shall
  be read as "qualified motor vehicle"; (3)  if  the  commissioner  enters
  into  a  cooperative  agreement  under  this  section,  the reference in
  section five hundred fourteen-a of this chapter  to  the  United  States
  postmark  shall  include a postmark made by the Canadian postal service;
  and (4) if the commissioner enters into a  cooperative  agreement  under
  this  section, for purposes of applying subdivision four of section five
  hundred fourteen of this chapter, the banks,  banking  houses  or  trust
  companies  which  may  be designated by the commissioner may include any
  such banks, banking houses or  trust  companies  designated  or  seeking
  designation  by  other member jurisdictions. For purposes of determining
  the amount of tax due in accordance with section  five  hundred  ten  of
  this  chapter  as  incorporated  by  this  subdivision, any return filed
  before the last day prescribed for its filing  shall  be  deemed  to  be
  filed  on  such  last day. The commissioner is authorized to provide for
  the joint administration, in whole or in part, of  the  tax  imposed  by
  article twenty-one of this chapter and the tax imposed by this article.
    (b) Cooperative agreements. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision
  of  law,  the  commissioner  is  authorized  to enter into a cooperative
  agreement with other states, the District of Columbia  or  provinces  or
  territories  of Canada for the administration of the tax imposed by this
  article and similar taxes imposed by other member jurisdictions and  for
  the  reporting  and  payment  of  tax  to  a  single  base  state  and a
  proportional sharing of revenue of taxes relating to fuel use among  the
  jurisdictions where a qualified motor vehicle is operated. The agreement
  may  provide  for  determining  the  base  state  for carriers, carriers
  records requirements, audit procedures, exchange of information, persons
  eligible  for  tax  licensing,  defining   qualified   motor   vehicles,
  determining if bonding is required and requiring bonds to secure the tax
  imposed  by  this  article  and  similar  taxes  imposed by other member
  jurisdictions, specifying reporting requirements and  periods  including
  defining   uniform  penalty  and  interest  rates  for  late  reporting,
  determining methods for collecting and forwarding of taxes, interest and
  penalties to another jurisdiction, notice and  timing  of  hearings  and
  other provisions as will facilitate the administration of the agreement.
  The commissioner may, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, forward to
  the  proper  officers  of another member jurisdiction any information in
  the commissioner's possession  relating  to  the  manufacture,  receipt,


 sale, use, transportation or shipment of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel
  by   any   person   and  may  share  any  information  relating  to  the
  administration of taxes pursuant to the agreement  with  such  officers.
  The  commissioner  may disclose to the proper officers of another member
  jurisdiction the location of offices, motor vehicles and other real  and
  personal property of carriers. The agreement may provide for each member
  jurisdiction  to  audit  the  records  of  persons  based  in the member
  jurisdiction and determine  taxes  due  each  member  jurisdiction.  The
  commissioner  may adopt rules and regulations for the administration and
  enforcement of the agreement. In connection with the  administration  of
  taxes  under  such  a  cooperative agreement, the commissioner may enter
  into an agreement with other member jurisdictions and any banks, banking
  houses, trust companies or other similar institutions  with  respect  to
  the payment of any tax, fees, penalty or interest to such banks, banking
  houses,  trust  companies  or  similar  institutions  and  the filing of
  returns and reports with such banks, banking houses, trust companies  or
  similar  institutions as agent of the commissioner and such other member
  jurisdictions. Pursuant to a written agreement made with one or more  of
  the  appropriate departments, agencies, officers or instrumentalities of
  other jurisdictions, the commissioner may let contracts for provision of
  such services to the department and to one or more of such  entities  of
  other jurisdictions; provided, that provisions shall be made in all such
  agreements  with the participating governmental entities and in all such
  contracts let by the commissioner for the  assumption  by  each  of  the
  participating  governmental  entities  of  sole  responsibility  for its
  proportionate share of the costs under the terms of such  contract.  The
  commissioner may contract for such services jointly with and pursuant to
  a  contract  let  by  the  appropriate  department,  agency,  officer or
  instrumentality  of  another  jurisdiction;  provided   that   (1)   the
  commissioner shall approve the proposed terms and conditions of all such
  joint governmental contracts, (2) the letting of such joint governmental
  contract  shall be based on invitation of competitive bids or proposals,
  and (3) the participation by the department in any such  joint  contract
  shall  be  preceded  by  an  evaluation  and  finding  in writing by the
  commissioner that a reasonable potential exists for the saving of  costs
  by the state, by means of such joint governmental contract.
    (c)  Rate  changes.  In  the  event the rate of tax imposed under this
  article or under section three hundred one-h of this chapter or the rate
  of surcharge imposed on such  tax  changes  and  such  change  does  not
  coincide  with the beginning of a reporting period, the rates of tax and
  surcharge for the reporting period which includes such change  shall  be
  equal  to  the  sum of the respective rates otherwise applicable in each
  month of the reporting period divided by the number  of  months  in  the
  reporting period.
    (d)  Construction.  In  the  event  the  commissioner, pursuant to the
  authority of this  article,  enters  into  a  cooperative  agreement  as
  provided in this section, the commissioner shall carry out any provision
  of such agreement required for continued New York state participation in
  such   agreement,  to  the  extent  not  inconsistent  with  a  specific
  requirement of this article or any other provision of the laws  and  the
  constitution of the state of New York.

  section for the purpose of recapturing the benefit  of  the  tax  tables
  contained in such subsections or section six hundred ninety-nine of this
  article,  as  the  case  may be. The supplemental tax shall be an amount
  equal to the sum of the tax table benefits in paragraphs  one,  two  and
  three  of  this  subsection  multiplied by their respective fractions in
  such paragraphs provided, however, that paragraph two of this subsection
  shall not apply to taxpayers that are not subject to the second  highest
  rate of tax.
    (1)  Resident  married  individuals  filing  joint  returns,  resident
  surviving spouses, resident  heads  of  households,  resident  unmarried
  individuals,  resident  married  individuals filing separate returns and
  resident estates and trusts. (A) The tax table benefit is the difference
  between (i) the amount of taxable income set forth in the tax  table  in
  subsection  (a),  (b) or (c), of this section, as the case may be, or in
  section six hundred ninety-nine, as the case may be, not subject to  the
  6.85  percent  rate  of tax for the taxable year multiplied by such rate
  and (ii) the dollar denominated tax for such amount  of  taxable  income
  set  forth in the tax table applicable to the taxable year in subsection


 (a), (b) or (c) of this section, as the case  may  be,  or  section  six
  hundred ninety-nine, as the case may be.
    (B)  The  fraction is computed as follows: the numerator is the lesser
  of fifty thousand dollars or the  excess  of  New  York  adjusted  gross
  income  for  the  taxable year over one hundred thousand dollars and the
  denominator is fifty thousand dollars.
    (2) Resident  married  individuals  filing  joint  returns,  surviving
  spouses,  resident  heads of households, resident unmarried individuals,
  resident  married  individuals  filing  separate  returns  and  resident
  estates  and trusts. (A) The tax table benefit is the difference between
  (i) the amount  of  taxable  income  set  forth  in  the  tax  table  in
  subsection  (a),  (b)  or  (c)  of this section, as the case may be, not
  subject to  the  second  highest  rate  of  tax  for  the  taxable  year
  multiplied  by  such rate and (ii) the second highest dollar denominated
  tax for such amount of  taxable  income  set  forth  in  the  tax  table
  applicable  to  the  taxable  year in subsection (a), (b) or (c) of this
  section, as the case may be, less the tax table benefit in paragraph one
  of this subsection.
    (B) For taxable years beginning after two thousand two and before  two
  thousand  six, the fraction is computed as follows: the numerator is the
  lesser of fifty thousand dollars or the  excess  of  New  York  adjusted
  gross  income  for  the  taxable  year  over  one hundred fifty thousand
  dollars and the denominator is fifty thousand dollars. For taxable years
  beginning after two thousand eight and before two thousand  twelve,  the
  fraction  is  computed  as follows: the numerator is the lesser of fifty
  thousand dollars or the excess of New York adjusted gross income for the
  taxable year over three hundred thousand dollars and the denominator  is
  fifty thousand dollars.
    (C)  This  paragraph shall only apply to taxable years beginning after
  two thousand two and before two thousand  six  and  after  two  thousand
  eight and before two thousand twelve.
    (3)  Resident  married  individuals  filing  joint  returns, surviving
  spouses, resident heads of households, resident  unmarried  individuals,
  resident  married  individuals  filing  separate  returns  and  resident
  estates and trusts. (A) The tax table benefit is the difference  between

  subsection (a), (b) or (c) of this section, as  the  case  may  be,  not
  subject  to  the  highest rate of tax for the taxable year multiplied by
  such rate and (ii) the highest dollar denominated tax set forth  in  the
  tax  table  applicable to the taxable year in subsection (a), (b) or (c)
  of this section, as the case may be, less  the  sum  of  the  tax  table
  benefits in paragraphs one and two of this subsection.
    (B)  For  such  taxpayers with adjusted gross income over five hundred
  thousand dollars, for taxable years beginning after two  thousand  eight
  and before two thousand twelve, the fraction is computed as follows: the
  numerator  is  the lesser of fifty thousand dollars or the excess of New
  York adjusted gross income  for  the  taxable  year  over  five  hundred
  thousand   dollars  and  the  denominator  is  fifty  thousand  dollars.
  Provided, however, that the total tax prior to the  application  of  any
  tax  credits  shall  not exceed the highest rate of tax set forth in the
  tax table in subsection (a) of this section multiplied by the taxpayer's
  taxable income.
    (C) This paragraph shall only apply to taxable years  beginning  after
  two  thousand  two  and  before  two thousand six and after two thousand
  eight and before two thousand twelve.
    (d-1) Alternative tax table  benefit  recapture.  Notwithstanding  the
  provisions  of  subsection  (d)  of  this  section,  for  taxable  years
  beginning  after  two  thousand  eleven,  there  is  hereby  imposed   a


 supplemental  tax  in addition to the tax imposed under subsections (a),
  (b) and (c) of this section for the purpose of recapturing  the  benefit

  over  twenty-five  million dollars and the denominator is fifty thousand
  dollars. This  subparagraph  shall  apply  only  to  the  taxable  years
  beginning  on or after January first, two thousand twenty-one and before
  January first, two thousand twenty-eight.
    (G) Provided, however, the total tax prior to the application  of  any
  tax  credits  shall  not exceed the highest rate of tax set forth in the
  tax  tables  in  subsection  (b)  of  this  section  multiplied  by  the
  taxpayer's taxable income.
    (3)  For  resident unmarried individuals, resident married individuals
  filing  separate  returns  and  resident   estates   and   trusts,   the
  supplemental  tax  shall  be an amount equal to the sum of the tax table
  benefits described in subparagraphs (A), (B) and (C) of  this  paragraph
  multiplied   by   their  respective  fractions  in  such  subparagraphs.
  Furthermore, in making the calculations described in these subparagraphs
  in taxable years beginning after tax year two  thousand  seventeen,  the
  applicable  tax  rates specified in subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of
  subsection (c) of this  section  shall  be  substituted  for  the  rates
  referenced in these subparagraphs.
    (A)  The tax table benefit is the difference between (i) the amount of
  taxable income set forth in the tax table in paragraph one of subsection
  (c) of this section not subject to the 6.65 percent rate of tax for  the
  taxable year multiplied by such rate and (ii) the dollar denominated tax
  for  such amount of taxable income set forth in the tax table applicable
  to the taxable year in paragraph one of subsection (c) of this  section.
  The  fraction  is  computed  as  follows: the numerator is the lesser of
  fifty thousand dollars or the excess of New York adjusted  gross  income
  for  the  taxable  year  over  one  hundred  thousand  dollars  and  the
  denominator is fifty thousand dollars.
    (B) The tax table benefit is the difference between (i) the amount  of

  for such amount of taxable income set forth in the tax table  applicable
  to  the  taxable year in paragraph one of subsection (c) of this section
  less the sum of the tax table benefits in subparagraphs (A) and  (B)  of
  this  paragraph.  The  fraction  for  this  subparagraph  is computed as
  follows: the numerator is the lesser of fifty thousand  dollars  or  the
  excess  of  New York adjusted gross income for the taxable year over one
  million dollars and the denominator  is  fifty  thousand  dollars.  This
  subparagraph  shall  apply  only  to taxable years beginning on or after
  January first,  two  thousand  twelve  and  before  January  first,  two
  thousand  twenty-one  and  for  tax  years beginning on or after January

  taxable year multiplied by such rate and (ii) the dollar denominated tax
  for such amount of taxable income set forth in the tax table  applicable
  to  the  taxable year in paragraph one of subsection (a) of this section
  less the sum of the tax table benefits in subparagraphs (A) and  (B)  of
  this  paragraph.  The  fraction  for  this  subparagraph  is computed as
  follows: the numerator is the lesser of fifty thousand dollars or excess
  of New York adjusted gross income for the taxable year over one  million
  five  hundred  thousand  dollars  and  the denominator is fifty thousand
  dollars. This  subparagraph  shall  apply  only  to  the  taxable  years
  beginning  on or after January first, two thousand twenty-one and before
  January first, two thousand twenty-eight.
    (E) The tax table benefit is the difference between (i) the amount  of
  taxable income set forth in the tax table in paragraph one of subsection
  (a) of this section not subject to the 10.30 percent rate of tax for the
  taxable year multiplied by such rate and (ii) the dollar denominated tax
  for  such amount of taxable income set forth in the tax table applicable
  to the taxable year in paragraph one of subsection (a) of  this  section
  less the sum of the tax table benefits in subparagraphs (A), (B) and (D)
  of  this  paragraph.  The  fraction for this subparagraph is computed as
  follows: the numerator is the lesser of fifty thousand dollars or excess
  of New York adjusted gross income for the taxable year over five million
  dollars and the denominator is fifty thousand dollars. This subparagraph
  shall apply only to the taxable years  beginning  on  or  after  January
  first,  two  thousand  twenty-one and before January first, two thousand
  twenty-eight.

  for  such amount of taxable income set forth in the tax table applicable
  to the taxable year in paragraph one of subsection (a) of  this  section
  less  the  sum  of the tax table benefits in subparagraphs (A), (B), (D)
  and (E) of  this  paragraph.  The  fraction  for  this  subparagraph  is
  computed  as  follows:  the  numerator  is  the lesser of fifty thousand
  dollars or excess of New York adjusted gross income for the taxable year


 over twenty-five million dollars and the denominator is  fifty  thousand
  dollars.  This  subparagraph  shall  apply  only  to  the  taxable years
  beginning on or after January first, two thousand twenty-one and  before

  tax credits shall not exceed the highest rate of tax set  forth  in  the
  tax  tables  in  subsection  (c)  of  this  section  multiplied  by  the
  taxpayer's taxable income.

  provisions of subsection (d) or (d-1) of this section, for taxable years
  beginning  on  or  after two thousand twenty-one and before two thousand

  product of 6.25 percent and New York taxable income and  the  tax  table
  computation on the New York taxable income set forth in paragraph one of
  subsection  (c) of this section, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
  of which is the lesser of fifty thousand dollars or  New  York  adjusted
  gross income minus one hundred seven thousand six hundred fifty dollars,
  and the denominator of which is fifty thousand dollars.
    (B)  If  New  York  adjusted  gross income is greater than twenty-five
  million dollars, the supplemental tax due  shall  equal  the  difference

  two thousand twenty-eight, there is hereby imposed a supplemental tax in
  addition  to  the tax imposed under subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this
  section for the purpose of recapturing the benefit  of  the  tax  tables
  contained in such subsections. During these taxable years, any reference

  thousand fourteen, the commissioner, not later than September first, two
  thousand thirteen, shall multiply the amounts  specified  in  subsection

  the twelve month period ending on June thirtieth of the year immediately
  preceding the tax year for which the adjustment is being made  (referred
  to  as  the  adjustment  year)  exceeds the average monthly value of the
  consumer price  index  for  the  twelve  month  period  ending  on  June
  thirtieth  of  the  year  immediately preceding the adjustment year. For
  purposes of this section, the consumer price index  means  the  consumer
  price  index  for  all  urban  consumers  published by the United States
  department of labor.

  methods. (1) Accounting periods. A taxpayer's taxable  year  under  this
  article  shall  be  the  same as his taxable year for federal income tax
  purposes.
    (2) Change of accounting periods. If  a  taxpayer's  taxable  year  is
  changed  for  federal income tax purposes, his taxable year for purposes
  of this article shall be similarly changed. If a taxable  year  of  less
  than  twelve  months results from a change of taxable year, the New York
  standard deduction and the New York exemptions shall be  prorated  under
  regulations of the tax commission.
    (3)  Accounting  methods. A taxpayer's method of accounting under this
  article shall be the same as his method of accounting for federal income

  such method as in the opinion of the  tax  commission  clearly  reflects
  income.
    (4)  Change  of  accounting  methods.  (A)  If  a taxpayer's method of
  accounting is changed for federal income tax  purposes,  his  method  of
  accounting for purposes of this article shall be similarly changed.

  an accrual to an installment method, any additional  tax  which  results
  from  adjustments  determined  to  be  necessary solely by reason of the
  change shall not be  greater  than  if  such  adjustments  were  ratably
  allocated  and  included  for  the  taxable  year  of the change and the
  preceding taxable years, not in excess of two, during which the taxpayer
  used the method of accounting from which the change is made.
    (C) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed from an accrual to
  an installment method, any additional tax for the year of such change of
  method and for any subsequent year which is attributable to the  receipt
  of  installment  payments  properly  accrued  in  a prior year, shall be
  reduced by the portion of tax for any prior taxable year attributable to
  the accrual of such installment payments, in accordance with regulations
  of the tax commission.
    (b) Resident, nonresident and part-year resident defined. (1) Resident

  taxable year with or within which the period of five hundred forty-eight
  consecutive  days begins and the nonresident portion of the taxable year
  with or within which the period ends, the taxpayer is  present  in  this
  state  for  a number of days which does not exceed an amount which bears
  the same ratio to ninety as the number of days contained in that portion
  of the taxable year bears to five hundred forty-eight, or
    (B) who maintains a permanent place of abode in this state and  spends
  in  the aggregate more than one hundred eighty-three days of the taxable
  year in this state, whether or not  domiciled  in  this  state  for  any
  portion of the taxable year, unless such individual is in active service
  in the armed forces of the United States.

  state, or
    (C) a trust, or portion of a trust, consisting of the property of:
    (i)  a  person  domiciled  in this state at the time such property was
  transferred to the trust, if such trust or portion of a trust  was  then

  irrevocable.
    (D) (i) Provided, however, a resident trust  is  not  subject  to  tax
  under this article if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

  trust were a non-resident trust.
    (ii) For purposes of item (II) of clause  (i)  of  this  subparagraph,
  intangible property shall be located in this state if one or more of the
  trustees are domiciled in the state of New York.

  chapter, as such section was in effect  on  December  thirty-first,  two
  thousand  fourteen, and which is domiciled outside the state of New York
  at the time it becomes a  trustee  of  the  trust  shall  be  deemed  to
  continue  to  be  a  trustee  domiciled  outside  the  state of New York
  notwithstanding that it thereafter otherwise becomes a trustee domiciled
  in the state of New York by virtue of being acquired by, or becoming  an
  office  or  branch of, a corporate trustee domiciled within the state of
  New York.
    For the purposes of the foregoing, a trust or portion of  a  trust  is
  revocable if it is subject to a power, exercisable immediately or at any
  future  time,  to  revest title in the person whose property constitutes
  such trust or portion of a trust, and a trust  or  portion  of  a  trust

  contrary,  the  making  of  a  financial  contribution,  gift,  bequest,
  donation or any other financial instrument or pledge in  any  amount  or
  the  donation  or  loan of any object of any value, or the volunteering,
  giving or donation of uncompensated time,  or  any  combination  of  the

  credit  base. The investment credit base is the cost or other basis, for
  federal income tax purposes, of tangible  personal  property  and  other
  tangible  property,  including  buildings  and  structural components of
  buildings, described in paragraph  two  of  this  subsection,  less  the
  amount  of  the  nonqualified nonrecourse financing with respect to such
  property to the extent such  financing  would  be  excludible  from  the
  credit  base  pursuant  to section 46(c)(8) of the internal revenue code
  (treating such property as section thirty-eight property irrespective of
  whether or not it in fact constitutes  section  thirty-eight  property).
  If,  at  the close of a taxable year following the taxable year in which
  such property was placed in service, there is  a  net  decrease  in  the
  amount  of  nonqualified  nonrecourse  financing  with  respect  to such
  property, such net decrease shall be treated as if it were the  cost  or
  other  basis  of  property described in paragraph two of this subsection
  acquired, constructed, reconstructed or erected during the year  of  the
  decrease  in  the  amount  of  nonqualified  nonrecourse  financing. The
  percentage to be used to compute the credit  allowed  pursuant  to  this
  subsection  shall  be  that  percentage appearing in column two which is
  opposite the appropriate period in column  one  in  which  the  tangible
  personal  property  was acquired, constructed, reconstructed or erected,
  as the case may be:
 
  Column 1                             Column 2
  After December 31, 1968 and
  prior to January 1, 1974             one per cent
  After December 31, 1973 and
  prior to January 1, 1978             two per cent
  After December 31, 1977 and
  prior to January 1, 1979             three per cent
  After December 31, 1978 and
  prior to June 1, 1981                four per cent
  After May 31, 1981 and
  prior to July 1, 1982                five per cent
  After June 30, 1982 and
  before January 1, 1987               six per cent
  After December 31, 1986              four per cent, except that  in  the
                                       case of  research  and  development
                                       property  the applicable percentage
                                       shall be seven
 
  Provided, however, that in the case  of  an  acquisition,  construction,
  reconstruction  or  erection  which  was commenced in any one period and
  continued or completed in any subsequent period the credit shall be  the
  sum  of  the portions of the investment credit base attributable to each
  such period, which portion with respect to each  such  period  shall  be
  ascertained by multiplying such investment credit base by a fraction the
  numerator  of  which  shall  be the expenditures paid or incurred during
  such period for such purposes and the denominator of which shall be  the
  total  of  all  expenditures  paid  or  incurred  for  such acquisition,
  construction, reconstruction or erection, multiplied  by  the  allowable
  percentage for each such period.
    (1-a)  For  a  taxpayer  that  is  an  eligible  farmer, as defined in
  subsection (n) of this section, the percentage to be used to compute the
  credit allowed  under  this  subsection  shall  be  twenty  percent  for


 property  described  in  subparagraph  (A)  of  paragraph  two  of  this
  subsection that is principally used by the taxpayer in the production of
  goods   by   farming,   agriculture,   horticulture,   floriculture   or
  viticulture.
    (2)  (A)  A credit shall be allowed under this subsection with respect
  to tangible personal property and  other  tangible  property,  including
  buildings and structural components of buildings, which are: depreciable
  pursuant  to  section  one  hundred  sixty-seven of the internal revenue
  code, have a useful life of four years or more, are acquired by purchase
  as defined in section one  hundred  seventy-nine  (d)  of  the  internal
  revenue code, have a situs in this state and are (i) principally used by
  the  taxpayer  in  the production of goods by manufacturing, processing,
  assembling,  refining,   mining,   extracting,   farming,   agriculture,
  horticulture,  floriculture,  viticulture  or  commercial  fishing, (ii)
  industrial  waste  treatment  facilities  or   air   pollution   control
  facilities, used in the taxpayer's trade or business, (iii) research and
  development  property,  (iv)  principally used in the ordinary course of
  the taxpayer's trade or business as a broker  or  dealer  in  connection
  with the purchase or sale (which shall include but not be limited to the
  issuance, entering into, assumption, offset, assignment, termination, or
  transfer)  of  stocks,  bonds  or other securities as defined in section
  four hundred seventy-five (c)(2) of the Internal  Revenue  Code,  or  of
  commodities  as  defined in section 475(e) of the Internal Revenue Code,
  (v) principally used in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's  trade  or
  business  of  providing  investment  advisory  services  for a regulated
  investment company as defined in section eight hundred fifty-one of  the
  Internal  Revenue Code, or lending, loan arrangement or loan origination
  services to customers in connection with the  purchase  or  sale  (which
  shall  include  but  not  be  limited  to  the  issuance, entering into,
  assumption, offset, assignment, termination, or transfer) of  securities
  as  defined  in section four hundred seventy-five (c)(2) of the Internal
  Revenue Code, or (vi) principally used as a  qualified  film  production
  facility  including  qualified film production facilities having a situs
  in an empire zone designated as such pursuant to article  eighteen-B  of
  the general municipal law, where the taxpayer is providing three or more
  services  to  any  qualified film production company using the facility,
  including such services as a studio lighting  grid,  lighting  and  grip
  equipment,  multi-line  phone  service, broadband information technology
  access, industrial scale electrical capacity,  food  services,  security
  services, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning. For purposes of
  clauses  (iv)  and  (v)  of  this  subparagraph, property purchased by a
  taxpayer affiliated with  a  regulated  broker,  dealer,  or  registered
  investment  adviser  is  allowed  a  credit under this subsection if the
  property  is  used  by  its  affiliated  regulated  broker,  dealer   or
  registered  investment  adviser  in accordance with this subsection. For
  purposes  of  determining  if  the  property  is  principally  used   in
  qualifying  uses, the uses by the taxpayer described in clauses (iv) and
  (v) of this subparagraph may be aggregated. In addition, the uses by the
  taxpayer,  its  affiliated  regulated  broker,  dealer  and   registered
  investment  adviser  under  either  or  both  of  those  clauses  may be
  aggregated. Provided, however, a  taxpayer  shall  not  be  allowed  the
  credit  provided by clauses (iv) and (v) of this subparagraph unless (I)
  eighty percent or more of the employees  performing  the  administrative
  and  support  functions resulting from or related to the qualifying uses
  of such equipment are located in this state, or (II) the average  number
  of  employees  that  perform  the  administrative  and support functions
  resulting from or related to the qualifying uses of such  equipment  and
  are  located  in this state during the taxable year for which the credit


 is claimed is equal to  or  greater  than  ninety-five  percent  of  the
  average number of employees that perform these functions and are located
  in  this  state  during  the thirty-six months immediately preceding the
  year  for  which the credit is claimed, or (III) the number of employees
  located in this state during the taxable year for which  the  credit  is
  claimed  is  equal  to  or  greater than ninety percent of the number of
  employees located in  this  state  on  December  thirty-first,  nineteen
  hundred  ninety-eight  or,  if  the  taxpayer  was  not  a calendar year
  taxpayer in nineteen hundred ninety-eight, the last  day  of  its  first
  taxable  year  ending  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-eight. If the taxpayer becomes subject to tax in this state after
  the taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred  ninety-eight,  then  the
  taxpayer  is not required to satisfy the employment test provided in the
  preceding sentence of this subparagraph for its first taxable year.  For
  the  purposes  of  clause (III) of this subparagraph the employment test
  will be based on the number of employees located in this  state  on  the
  last  day  of  the  first taxable year the taxpayer is subject to tax in
  this state. If the uses of the property must be aggregated to  determine
  whether the property is principally used in qualifying uses, then either
  each  affiliate  using the property must satisfy this employment test or
  this employment test must be satisfied through the  aggregation  of  the
  employees  of the taxpayer, its affiliated regulated broker, dealer, and
  registered investment adviser using the property. For purposes of clause
  (i) of this subparagraph, tangible personal property and other  tangible
  property  shall not include property principally used by the taxpayer in
  the  production  or  distribution  of  electricity,  natural  gas  after
  extraction  from  wells,  steam,  or  water  delivered through pipes and
  mains.
    (B) For purposes of this paragraph, the  following  definitions  shall
  apply:
    (i) Manufacturing shall mean the process of working raw materials into
  wares  suitable  for  use  or which gives new shapes, new quality or new
  combinations to matter which already has gone  through  some  artificial
  process  by  the  use  of machinery, tools, appliances and other similar
  equipment. Property used  in  the  production  of  goods  shall  include
  machinery,  equipment  or  other  tangible property which is principally
  used in the repair and service of other machinery,  equipment  or  other
  tangible  property used principally in the production of goods and shall
  include all facilities  used  in  the  production  operation,  including
  storage  of  material  to be used in production and of the products that
  are produced.
    (ii) Research and development property shall mean  property  which  is
  used  for  purposes  of  research and development in the experimental or
  laboratory sense. Such purposes shall  not  be  deemed  to  include  the
  ordinary  testing  or  inspection  of  materials or products for quality
  control,  efficiency  surveys,  management  studies,  consumer  surveys,
  advertising,  promotions,  or  research  in  connection  with  literary,
  historical or similar projects.
    (iii)  Industrial  waste  treatment  facilities  shall  mean  property
  constituting   facilities   for   the   treatment,   neutralization   or
  stabilization of  industrial  waste  and  other  wastes  (as  the  terms
  "industrial  waste" and "other wastes" are defined in section 17-0105 of
  the environmental conservation law) from a point  immediately  preceding
  the  point  of  such  treatment,  neutralization or stabilization to the
  point of disposal, including  the  necessary  pumping  and  transmitting
  facilities,  but  excluding  such  facilities  installed for the primary
  purpose of salvaging materials which are  usable  in  the  manufacturing
  process or are marketable.


   (iv) Air pollution control facilities shall mean property constituting
  facilities which remove, reduce, or render less noxious air contaminants
  emitted from an air contamination source (as the terms "air contaminant"
  and  "air  contamination  source"  are defined in section 19-0107 of the
  environmental  conservation  law) from a point immediately preceding the
  point of such removal, reduction or rendering to the point of  discharge
  of  air,  meeting emission standards as established by the department of
  environmental conservation, but excluding such facilities installed  for
  the  primary  purpose  of  salvaging  materials  which are usable in the
  manufacturing process or are marketable and excluding  those  facilities
  which rely for their efficacy on dilution, dispersion or assimilation of
  air  contaminants  in  the  ambient  air after emission. Such term shall
  further include flue gas desulfurization equipment and attendant  sludge
  disposal  facilities, fluidized bed boilers, precombustion coal cleaning
  facilities or other facilities that conform  with  this  subsection  and
  which  comply  with  the provisions of the State Acid Deposition Control
  Act set forth in title nine of article  nineteen  of  the  environmental
  conservation law.
    (v)  For  purposes  of  this  paragraph,  the  terms  "qualified  film
  production facility" and "qualified film production company" shall  have
  the same meaning as in section twenty-four of this chapter.
    (C)  However,  such credit shall be allowed with respect to industrial
  waste treatment facilities and air pollution control facilities only  on
  condition  that  such  facilities  have  been  certified  by  the  state
  commissioner   of   environmental   conservation   or   his   designated
  representative,  pursuant  to  subdivision  one  of  section  17-0707 or
  subdivision one of section 19-0309  of  the  environmental  conservation
  law,  as  complying  with  applicable  provisions  of  the environmental
  conservation law, the public health law, the  state  sanitary  code  and
  codes, rules, regulations, permits or orders issued pursuant thereto.
    (3)  A  taxpayer  shall  not be allowed a credit under this subsection
  with respect to any property described in clause (i) of subparagraph (B)
  of paragraph two hereof if such property qualifies for the  modification
  allowed under either paragraph three or paragraph four of subsection (g)
  of section six hundred twelve whether or not such amount shall have been
  subtracted.  Provided, however, with respect to property which qualifies
  for a modification under either clause (A), (B) or (C) of paragraph four
  of subsection (g)  because  such  property  was  ordered  on  or  before
  December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, but with respect to
  which  no  expenditure  has  been  paid  or  incurred  at such date, the
  taxpayer may elect to subtract the amount allowable under  clauses  (A),
  (B)  or  (C) or may take the credit provided by this subsection, but not
  both.
    (4) A taxpayer shall not be allowed a  credit  under  this  subsection
  with  respect to tangible personal property and other tangible property,
  including buildings and structural components  of  buildings,  which  it
  leases to any other person or corporation except where a taxpayer leases
  property  to  an  affiliated  regulated  broker,  dealer,  or registered
  investment adviser that uses such property  in  accordance  with  clause
  (iv) or (v) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph two of this subsection. For
  purposes  of  the preceding sentence, any contract or agreement to lease
  or rent or for a license to use such  property  shall  be  considered  a
  lease.  Provided,  however,  in  determining whether a taxpayer shall be
  allowed a credit under this subsection with respect  to  such  property,
  any  election  made  with  respect  to  such  property  pursuant  to the
  provisions of paragraph eight of subsection (f) of section  one  hundred
  sixty-eight  of  the  internal  revenue  code,  as such paragraph was in
  effect for agreements entered into  prior  to  January  first,  nineteen


 hundred   eighty-four,  shall  be  disregarded.  For  purposes  of  this
  paragraph, the  use  of  a  qualified  film  production  facility  by  a
  qualified  film  production  company  shall not be considered a lease of
  such facility to such company.
    (5)  If  the  amount of credit allowable under this subsection for any
  taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year,  the  excess
  allowed  for  a taxable year commencing prior to January first, nineteen
  hundred eighty-seven may be carried over to the following year or  years
  and  may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years, but
  in no  event  shall  such  credit  be  carried  over  to  taxable  years
  commencing on or after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven, and
  any  amount  of credit allowed for a taxable year commencing on or after
  January first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven and not deductible in  such
  year  may  be  carried over to the ten taxable years next following such
  taxable year and may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for  such  year
  or  years.  In lieu of carrying over any such excess, (A) a taxpayer who
  qualifies as an owner of a new business for purposes of paragraph ten of
  this subsection may, at the taxpayer's option, receive such excess as  a
  refund,  and  (B)  a  taxpayer  that is an eligible farmer as defined in
  subsection (n) of this  section  may,  at  the  taxpayer's  option,  for
  taxable  years beginning before January first, two thousand twenty-eight
  receive such excess as a  refund.  Any  refund  paid  pursuant  to  this
  paragraph  shall  be  deemed  to be a refund of an overpayment of tax as
  provided in section six hundred eighty-six of  this  article,  provided,
  however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.
    (6)  At  the option of the taxpayer for taxable years commencing prior
  to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven, air or water  pollution
  control  facilities  which  qualify  for  elective  modifications  under
  subsection  (h)  of  section  six  hundred  twelve,  or   research   and
  development  facilities  which  qualify for elective modifications under
  paragraphs two and four of subsection (g) of section six hundred  twelve
  may  be  treated  as  property  principally  used by the taxpayer in the
  production of goods by manufacturing, processing, assembling,  refining,
  mining,  extracting,  farming,  agriculture, horticulture, floriculture,
  viticulture or  commercial  fishing,  provided  the  property  otherwise
  qualifies  under  paragraph  two  of  this subsection, in which event, a
  modification shall not be allowed under such subsection  (h)  and  under
  such paragraphs two and four of subsection (g).
    (7)  (A)  With  respect  to  property which is depreciable pursuant to
  section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code but is  not
  subject  to  the  provisions  of section one hundred sixty-eight of such
  code and which is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior  to
  the  end  of  the  taxable  year in which the credit is to be taken, the
  amount of the credit shall be that portion of the credit provided for in
  this subsection which represents the ratio which the months of qualified
  use bear to the months of useful life. If property on which  credit  has
  been  taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to the
  end of its useful life, the difference between the credit taken and  the
  credit  allowed  for  actual  use  must  be  added  back  in the year of
  disposition. Provided, however, if  such  property  is  disposed  of  or
  ceases  to  be  in  qualified use after it has been in qualified use for
  more than twelve consecutive years, it shall not  be  necessary  to  add
  back  the  credit as provided in this subparagraph. The amount of credit
  allowed for actual use shall be determined by multiplying  the  original
  credit by the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to the months
  of  useful  life.  For  purposes  of  this  subparagraph, useful life of
  property shall be  the  same  as  the  taxpayer  uses  for  depreciation
  purposes when computing his federal income tax liability.


   (B)  Except with respect to that property to which subparagraph (D) of
  this paragraph applies, with respect to three-year property, as  defined
  in  subsection  (e)  of  section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal
  revenue code, which is disposed of or ceases  to  be  in  qualified  use
  prior to the end of the taxable year in which the credit is to be taken,
  the  amount  of  the credit shall be that portion of the credit provided
  for in this subsection which represents the ratio which  the  months  of
  qualified  use  bear to thirty-six. If property on which credit has been
  taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to  the  end
  of  thirty-six  months,  the difference between the credit taken and the
  credit allowed for actual  use  must  be  added  back  in  the  year  of
  disposition.  The  amount  of  credit  allowed  for  actual use shall be
  determined by multiplying the original credit by  the  ratio  which  the
  months of qualified use bear to thirty-six.
    (C)  Except with respect to that property to which subparagraph (D) of
  this  paragraph  applies,  with  respect  to  property  subject  to  the
  provisions  of  section  one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue
  code, other than three-year property as defined  in  subsection  (e)  of
  such  section  one hundred sixty-eight which is disposed of or ceases to
  be in qualified use prior to the end of the taxable year  in  which  the
  credit is to be taken, the amount of the credit shall be that portion of
  the  credit  provided  for in this subsection which represents the ratio
  which the months of qualified use bear to sixty. If  property  on  which
  credit  has  been  taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use
  prior to the end of sixty months,  the  difference  between  the  credit
  taken  and  the  credit allowed for actual use must be added back in the
  year of disposition. The amount of credit allowed for actual  use  shall
  be  determined by multiplying the original credit by the ratio which the
  months of qualified use bear to sixty.
    (D) With  respect  to  any  property  to  which  section  one  hundred
  sixty-eight of the internal revenue code applies, which is a building or
  a  structural component of a building and which is disposed of or ceases
  to be in qualified use prior to the end of the taxable year in which the
  credit is to be taken, the amount of the credit shall be that portion of
  the credit provided for in this subsection which  represents  the  ratio
  which  the  months  of  qualified use bear to the total number of months
  over which the  taxpayer  chooses  to  deduct  the  property  under  the
  internal  revenue  code.  If  property on which credit has been taken is
  disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to  the  end  of  the
  period  over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the property under the
  internal revenue code, the difference between the credit taken  and  the
  credit  allowed  for  actual  use  must  be  added  back  in the year of
  disposition. Provided, however, if  such  property  is  disposed  of  or
  ceases  to  be  in  qualified use after it has been in qualified use for
  more than twelve consecutive years, it shall not  be  necessary  to  add
  back  the  credit as provided in this subparagraph. The amount of credit
  allowed for actual use shall be determined by multiplying  the  original
  credit  by the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to the total
  number of months over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the  property
  under the internal revenue code.
    (E) For purposes of this paragraph, property (i) which is described in
  subparagraph  (B),  (C)  or  (D)  of  this  paragraph, and (ii) which is
  subject  to  paragraph  twenty-six  of  subsection  (c)  and   paragraph
  twenty-five  of  subsection  (b)  of  section six hundred twelve of this
  chapter, shall be treated as property which is depreciable  pursuant  to
  section  one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code but is not
  subject to section one hundred sixty-eight of such code.


   (F) For purposes of this paragraph, where a  credit  is  allowed  with
  respect  to  an  air  pollution  control  facility  on  the  basis  of a
  certificate  of  compliance  issued  pursuant   to   the   environmental
  conservation  law and the certificate is revoked pursuant to subdivision
  three  of  section  19-0309  of the environmental conservation law, such
  revocation shall constitute a disposal or cessation  of  qualified  use,
  unless such facility is described in clause (i) or (iii) of subparagraph
  (A)  of  paragraph  two  of  this  subsection. Also for purposes of this
  subparagraph, the use  of  an  air  pollution  control  facility  or  an
  industrial waste treatment facility for the primary purpose of salvaging
  materials   which  are  usable  in  the  manufacturing  process  or  are
  marketable shall constitute a cessation of qualified  use,  unless  such
  facility  is  described  in  clause  (i) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) of
  paragraph two of this subsection.
    (G) For taxable years commencing on or after January  first,  nineteen
  hundred  eighty-seven,  the amount required to be added back pursuant to
  this paragraph shall be augmented by an amount equal to the  product  of
  such  amount  and  the  underpayment rate of interest (without regard to
  compounding), set by the commissioner  pursuant  to  subsection  (j)  of
  section  six  hundred  ninety-seven,  in  effect  on the last day of the
  taxable year.
    (H) If, as of the close of the taxable year, there is a  net  increase
  with  respect  to the taxpayer in the amount of nonqualified nonrecourse
  financing (within the meaning of  section  46(c)  (8)  of  the  internal
  revenue  code)  with  respect  to any property with respect to which the
  credit  under  this  subsection  was  limited  based   on   attributable
  nonqualified nonrecourse financing, then an amount equal to the decrease
  in such credit which would have resulted from reducing, by the amount of
  such  net  increase,  the  cost  or  other basis taken into account with
  respect to such property must be added back in such  taxable  year.  The
  amount  of  nonqualified  nonrecourse  financing shall not be treated as
  increased by reason of a transfer of  (or  agreement  to  transfer)  any
  evidence  of  an indebtedness if such transfer occurs (or such agreement
  is entered into) more than one year after the date such indebtedness was
  incurred.
    (10) For purposes of paragraph five of this subsection, an  individual
  who  is  either  a  sole  proprietor  or a member of a partnership shall
  qualify as an owner of a new business unless:
    (A) the business of which the individual is an owner is  substantially
  similar  in  operation and in ownership to a business entity taxable, or
  previously taxable, under section one hundred eighty-three, one  hundred
  eighty-four  or former section one hundred eighty-five former section of
  article nine; article nine-A or thirty-three of  this  chapter;  article
  twenty-three  of  this  chapter  or which would have been subject to tax
  under such article twenty-three  (as  such  article  was  in  effect  on
  January  first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty),  article thirty-two of this
  chapter or which would have been  subject  to  tax  under  such  article
  thirty-two  (as such article was in effect on December thirty-first, two
  thousand fourteen) or the income  (or  losses)  of  which  is  (or  was)
  includable  under  article twenty-two of this chapter whereby the intent
  and purpose of this paragraph and paragraph five of this subsection with
  respect to refunding of credit to new business would be evaded; or
    (B) the individual has operated such new business entity in this state
  for  more  than  five  taxable  years  (excluding  short  years  of  the
  business).
    (11)  Retail  enterprise tax credit. A retail enterprise, not eligible
  to claim the credit under paragraph one of this subsection, but eligible
  to claim the credit allowable under section thirty-eight of the internal


 revenue code pursuant solely to the provisions of  subparagraph  (E)  of
  paragraph  one  of  subsection  (a) of section forty-eight of such code,
  shall be allowed a credit as hereinafter computed.  The  amount  of  the
  credit  shall  be  the  percentage  appearing  in  paragraph one of this
  subsection for the periods described therein for the amount of qualified
  rehabilitation expenditures, as defined in  subsection  (g)  of  section
  forty-eight  of  such code, paid or incurred with respect to a qualified
  rehabilitated building, as defined in such subsection  (g),  located  in
  this  state  and  such expenditures shall be further limited to only the
  portion thereof paid  or  incurred  with  respect  to  that  part  of  a
  qualified rehabilitated building employed by such taxpayer in the retail
  sales  activity  of  such  retail  enterprise.  For the purposes of this
  subsection, the term "retail enterprise" means a taxpayer which is:  (A)
  a  registered  vendor  under  article  twenty-eight of this chapter, (B)
  primarily engaged in the retail sale,  as  the  term  "retail  sale"  is
  defined  in  subparagraph  (i)  of  paragraph four of subdivision (b) of
  section eleven  hundred  one  of  this  chapter,  of  tangible  personal
  property,  and (C) otherwise eligible for the credit allowed pursuant to
  section thirty-eight of the internal revenue code.
    (12) Rehabilitation credit for historic barns.  A  taxpayer  shall  be
  allowed  a  credit,  to be computed as hereinafter provided, against the
  tax imposed  by  this  article.  The  amount  of  the  credit  shall  be
  twenty-five   percent   of   the   taxpayer's  qualified  rehabilitation
  expenditures  paid  or  incurred  within  the  five  years   immediately
  preceding  the  year  in  which  such  tax  credit shall be applied with
  respect to any barn located in this state which qualifies as an historic
  barn pursuant to subdivision five of section four hundred eighty-three-b
  of the real property tax law. For purposes of this paragraph,  the  term
  "barn"  means a building that is or was used as an agricultural facility
  or  for  purposes  related  to  agriculture.  Provided,  however,   such
  qualified   rehabilitation  expenditures  shall  not  include  any  such
  expenditures  which  are  included,  directly  or  indirectly,  in   the
  computation  of  a  credit claimed by the taxpayer pursuant to paragraph
  one of this subsection. Provided further that no  rehabilitation  credit
  shall  be  allowed  for  any rehabilitation of a barn which, immediately
  prior  to  the  commencement  of  such  rehabilitation,  was  used   for
  residential  purposes,  or  which  converts  a  barn  not  suitable  for
  residential purposes  into  one  which  is  so  suitable,  nor  shall  a
  rehabilitation  credit be allowed for any rehabilitation that materially
  alters the historic appearance of the barn.
    (13)(A)(i) If a taxpayer  is  required  by  paragraph  seven  of  this
  subsection  to  add  back a portion of the credit taken because property
  was destroyed or ceased to be in qualified use as a direct result of the
  September eleventh, two thousand one terrorist  attacks,  such  taxpayer
  may  elect to defer the amount to be recaptured for all such property to
  the  taxable  year  next  succeeding  the  taxable  year  in  which  the
  destruction  or cessation of qualified use occurred. The taxable year in
  which the destruction or cessation of qualified use  occurred  shall  be
  hereinafter  referred  to  as the "recapture event taxable year". If the
  taxpayer's total employment number in the state on the last day  of  the
  taxable  year  next  succeeding  the  recapture  event taxable year is a
  significant percentage of the taxpayer's average total employment number
  in the state for the taxpayer's recapture event taxable year and the two
  taxable years immediately preceding the recapture  event  taxable  year,
  then  the  taxpayer  shall  not be required to recapture any credit with
  respect to such property. If the taxpayer's total employment  number  in
  the  state  on  the  last  day  of  the taxable year next succeeding the
  recapture event taxable year is not  a  significant  percentage  of  the


 taxpayer's  average  total  employment  number  in  the  state  for  the
  taxpayer's recapture event  taxable  year  and  the  two  taxable  years
  immediately  preceding  the  recapture  event taxable year, the taxpayer
  shall  be  required  to  recapture the portion of the credit taken under
  this subsection, as required by paragraph seven of this subsection,  for
  all  of its property destroyed or which ceased to be in qualified use as
  a direct result of the September eleventh, two  thousand  one  terrorist
  attacks.  The  amount  required  to  be recaptured shall be augmented as
  required pursuant  to  subparagraph  (G)  of  paragraph  seven  of  this
  subsection  by  using  an  interest  rate equal to two times the rate of
  interest specified in such subparagraph seven applicable for the taxable
  year in which the recapture occurs.
    (ii)  The  taxpayer's  total  employment  number  shall  include   all
  employees  of  the  taxpayer  employed  full-time by the taxpayer in the
  state. The average total  employment  number  for  the  recapture  event
  taxable  year  and  the  two  taxable  years  immediately  preceding the
  recapture event taxable  year  shall  be  computed  by  determining  the
  taxpayer's total employment number on the thirty-first day of March, the
  thirtieth   day  of  June,  the  thirtieth  day  of  September  and  the
  thirty-first day of December during the applicable taxable years, adding
  together the number of such individuals determined to be so employed  on
  each  of  such  dates  and dividing the sum so obtained by the number of
  such dates occurring within such applicable taxable years.  However,  in
  the  case  of  the  taxable  year which included September eleventh, two
  thousand one, the average total employment number for such taxable  year
  shall  be  determined  by using the total employment number on September
  first, two thousand one in lieu of September thirtieth, two thousand one
  and, if such taxable year included December thirty-first,  two  thousand
  one,  by excluding the total employment number on December thirty-first,
  two thousand one.
    (B) In lieu of subparagraph (A) of  this  paragraph,  a  taxpayer  may
  elect   to  recapture  the  portion  of  the  credit  taken  under  this
  subsection, as required by paragraph seven of this subsection,  for  all
  of  its  property  destroyed or which ceased to be in qualified use as a
  direct result of the September  eleventh,  two  thousand  one  terrorist
  attacks,  in  the  taxable year in which the destruction or cessation of
  qualified use occurred. If the taxpayer makes such election and acquires
  property (hereinafter referred to as "replacement property") to  replace
  any property destroyed as a direct result of the September eleventh, two
  thousand  one  terrorist  attacks  (regardless of when such property was
  placed in service and whether a credit  was  claimed  on  that  property
  pursuant  to  this subsection), and such replacement property is similar
  or related in service or use to such destroyed property, the  investment
  credit  base  of  the  replacement  property shall be determined without
  regard to any basis reduction required pursuant to section 1033  of  the
  internal revenue code.
    (C) The election made by the taxpayer under subparagraph (A) or (B) of
  this  paragraph  shall  be made in the manner and form prescribed by the
  commissioner.
    (D) A taxpayer, over fifty percent of whose employees died as a direct
  result of the September eleventh, two thousand  one  terrorist  attacks,
  may  make  the  election  provided  for  in  subparagraph  (A)  of  this
  paragraph, and shall not  be  required  to  recapture  any  credit  with
  respect  to  property  which  was  destroyed  or  which  ceased to be in
  qualified use as a direct result of such  attacks,  whether  or  not  it
  meets the employment test specified in clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of
  this paragraph.


   (a-1)  Employment  incentive  credit (EIC). (1)(A) Where a taxpayer is
  allowed a credit under subsection (a) of this section, other than at the
  optional rate applicable  to  research  and  development  property,  the
  taxpayer  shall  be  allowed  a  credit  for  each of the two years next
  succeeding  the  taxable year for which the credit under such subsection
  (a) is allowed with respect to such property, whether or not  deductible
  in  such  taxable  year  or  in  subsequent  taxable  years  pursuant to
  paragraph five of subsection (a) of  this  section.  Provided,  however,
  that  the  credit  allowable  under this subsection for any taxable year
  shall be allowed only if the average number  of  employees  during  such
  taxable  year  is at least one hundred one percent of the average number
  of employees during the employment base year. The employment  base  year
  shall  be  the  taxable  year immediately preceding the taxable year for
  which the credit under such subsection (a) is allowed except that in the
  case of a new business, the employment base year shall  be  the  taxable
  year in which the credit under such subsection (a) is allowed.
    (B) The amount of the credit allowed under this subsection shall be as
  set forth in the following table:
 
  Average number of employees during      Credit allowed under this
  the taxable year expressed as a         subsection expressed as a
  percentage of average number of         percentage of the applicable
  employees in employment base year:      investment credit base:
    Less than 102%                                    1.5%
    at least 102% and less than 103%                  2%
    at least 103%                                     2.5%
 
    (2)  The  average  number  of  employees  in  a  taxable year shall be
  computed by ascertaining  the  number  of  employees  within  the  state
  employed by the taxpayer on the thirty-first day of March, the thirtieth
  day  of June, the thirtieth day of September and the thirty-first day of
  December in the taxable year, by adding together the number of employees
  ascertained on each of such dates and dividing the sum  so  obtained  by
  the  number  of  such  abovementioned dates occurring within the taxable
  year. For the purposes of this subsection, the  term  "employees  within
  the state" shall not include, except with respect to the employment base
  year,  any  employee  with  respect  to whom a credit provided for under
  subsection (k) of this section is claimed for the taxable year, based on
  employment within a zone equivalent area designated as such pursuant  to
  article eighteen-B of the general municipal law.
    (3)  If  the  amount of credit allowable under this subsection for any
  taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year,  the  excess
  allowed  for a taxable year may be carried over to the ten taxable years
  next following such taxable year and may be deducted from the taxpayer's
  tax for such year or years. In lieu of carrying over any such excess,  a
  taxpayer  who  qualifies  as  an owner of a new business for purposes of
  paragraph ten of subsection (a) of this  section  may,  at  his  or  her
  option,  receive  such  excess  as a refund. Any refund paid pursuant to
  this paragraph shall be deemed to be a refund of an overpayment  of  tax
  as provided in section six hundred eighty-six of this article, provided,
  however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.
    (a-2)  Hire  a vet credit.  (1) Allowance of credit. For taxable years
  beginning on or after January first, two  thousand  fifteen  and  before
  January  first,  two  thousand twenty-six, a taxpayer shall be allowed a
  credit, to be computed as provided in this subsection, against  the  tax
  imposed  by  this  article,  for hiring and employing, for not less than
  twelve continuous and uninterrupted months (hereinafter referred  to  as
  the  twelve-month  period)  in  a  full-time  or  part-time  position, a


 qualified veteran within the state. The taxpayer may claim the credit in
  the year in which  the  qualified  veteran  completes  the  twelve-month
  period  of employment by the taxpayer. If the taxpayer claims the credit
  allowed  under this subsection, the taxpayer may not use the hiring of a
  qualified veteran that is the basis for this credit in the basis of  any
  other credit allowed under this article.
    (2) Qualified veteran. A qualified veteran is an individual:
    (A)  who  served  on  active duty in the United States army, navy, air
  force, space force, marine corps, coast guard or the  reserves  thereof,
  or  who  served  in  active  military  service of the United States as a
  member of the army national guard, air national guard, New York guard or
  New York naval militia, or who served in the active  uniformed  services
  of  the  United  States  as  a  member  of the commissioned corps of the
  national oceanic and  atmospheric  administration  or  the  commissioned
  corps  of  the United States public health service; who (i) was released
  from active duty by general  or  honorable  discharge,  or  (ii)  has  a
  qualifying  condition,  as  defined  in  section  one  of  the veterans'
  services law, and has received a discharge other  than  bad  conduct  or
  dishonorable  from  such service, or (iii) is a discharged LGBT veteran,
  as defined in section  one  of  the  veterans'  services  law,  and  has
  received  a  discharge  other than bad conduct or dishonorable from such
  service;
    (B) who commences employment by the qualified  taxpayer  on  or  after
  January  first,  two  thousand  fourteen,  and before January first, two
  thousand twenty-five; and
    (C) who certifies by signed affidavit, under penalty of perjury,  that
  he or she has not been employed for thirty-five or more hours during any
  week  in  the  one hundred eighty day period immediately prior to his or
  her employment by the taxpayer.
    (3) Employer prohibition. An employer shall not discharge an  employee
  and  hire  a qualifying veteran solely for the purpose of qualifying for
  this credit.
    (4) Amount of credit. The  amount  of  the  credit  shall  be  fifteen
  percent  of  the  total  amount  of  wages paid to the qualified veteran
  during the veteran's first twelve-month period of employment.  Provided,
  however,  that,  if  the  qualified  veteran  is  a disabled veteran, as
  defined in paragraph (b) of subdivision one of  section  eighty-five  of
  the  civil service law, the amount of the credit shall be twenty percent
  of the total amount of wages paid to the qualified  veteran  during  the
  veteran's  first  twelve-month  period of employment. The credit allowed
  pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed in any  taxable  year:  (i)
  fifteen  thousand  dollars  for  any  qualified  veteran,  other  than a
  disabled veteran, employed in a  full-time  position  for  one  thousand
  eight  hundred  twenty  or  more  hours in one twelve-month period, (ii)
  twenty thousand dollars for any qualified  veteran  who  is  a  disabled
  veteran  employed in a full-time position for one thousand eight hundred
  twenty or more hours in one twelve-month period,  (iii)  seven  thousand
  five  hundred  dollars  for any qualified veteran, other than a disabled
  veteran, employed in a part-time position  for  at  least  one  thousand
  forty  hours but not more than one thousand eight hundred nineteen hours
  in one twelve-month period,  and  (iv)  ten  thousand  dollars  for  any
  qualified  veteran  who  is  a  disabled veteran employed in a part-time
  position for at least one thousand forty hours but  not  more  than  one
  thousand eight hundred nineteen hours in one twelve-month period.
    (5) Carryover. If the amount of credit allowable under this subsection
  for  any  taxable  year  exceeds  the  taxpayer's tax for such year, any
  amount of credit not deductible in such taxable year may be carried over


 to the following three years and may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax
  for such year or years.
    (b) Household credit.  (1) A household credit shall be allowed against
  the  tax  determined  under  subsections  (a) through (d) of section six
  hundred one of this  article.  The  credit,  computed  as  described  in
  paragraph  two  of  this subsection, shall not exceed the tax determined
  under subsections (a) through (d) of section six  hundred  one  for  the
  taxable  year,  reduced  by  the  credits  permitted  under sections six
  hundred twenty and six hundred twenty-one of this article.
    (2) (A) For any individual who is  not  married  nor  the  head  of  a
  household  nor  a  surviving  spouse,  the  amount of the credit allowed
  pursuant to this subsection for taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after
  January  first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-six  shall  be  determined in
  accordance with the following table:
 
    If household gross income is               The credit shall be
  Not over $5,000                                     $75.00
  Over $5,000 but not over $6,000                      60.00
  Over $6,000 but not over $7,000                      50.00

  Over $20,000 but not over $25,000                    40.00
  Over $25,000 but not over $28,000                    20.00
 
    (B) For any husband and  wife,  head  of  a  household,  or  surviving
  spouse, the amount of the credit allowed pursuant to this subsection for
  taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after January first, nineteen hundred
  eighty-six shall be determined in accordance with the following table:
 
    If household gross income is               The credit shall be
  Not over $5,000                     $90.00  plus  an  amount  equal   to
                                      $15.00 multiplied by a number  which
                                      is  one  less  than  the  number  of
                                      exemptions for  which  the  taxpayer
                                      (or  in  the  case  of a husband and
                                      wife, taxpayers) is  entitled  to  a
                                      deduction  for  the taxable year for
                                      federal income  tax  purposes  under
                                      subsections  (b)  and (c) of section
                                      one   hundred   fifty-one   of   the
                                      internal revenue code
  Over $5,000 but not over $6,000     $75.00 plus such an amount
  Over $6,000 but not over $7,000     $65.00 plus such an amount
  Over $7,000 but not over $20,000    $60.00 plus such an amount
  Over $20,000 but not over $22,000   $60.00  plus  an  amount  equal   to
                                      $10.00  multiplied by a number which
                                      is  one  less  than  the  number  of
                                      exemptions  for  which  the taxpayer
                                      (or in the case  of  a  husband  and
                                      wife,  taxpayers)  is  entitled to a
                                      deduction for the taxable  year  for
                                      federal  income  tax  purposes under
                                      subsections (b) and (c)  of  section
                                      one   hundred   fifty-one   of   the
                                      internal revenue code
  Over $22,000 but not over $25,000   $50.00 plus such an amount
  Over $25,000 but not over $28,000   $40.00 plus an amount equal to $5.00
                                      multiplied by a number which is  one
                                      less  than  the number of exemptions


                                     for which the taxpayer  (or  in  the
                                      case   of   a   husband   and  wife,
                                      taxpayers)   is   entitled   to    a
                                      deduction  for  the taxable year for
                                      federal income  tax  purposes  under
                                      subsections  (b)  and (c) of section
                                      one   hundred   fifty-one   of   the
                                      internal revenue code
  Over $28,000 but not over $32,000   $20.00 plus such an amount
 
    (3) For the purposes of this subsection:
    (A) "Household gross income" shall mean the aggregate federal adjusted
  gross  income  of  a  household,  as  the  term  household is defined in
  subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, for the taxable year.
    (B) "Household" means a husband and  wife,  a  head  of  household,  a
  surviving  spouse, or an individual who is not married nor the head of a
  household nor a surviving spouse nor a taxpayer with respect to  whom  a
  deduction  under  subsection (c) of section one hundred fifty-one of the
  internal revenue code is allowable to another taxpayer for  the  taxable
  year.
    (C)  "Household  gross  income  of  a  husband  and wife" shall be the
  aggregate of their federal adjusted gross incomes for the  taxable  year
  irrespective  of  whether  joint or separate New York income tax returns
  are filed. Provided, however, that a husband or wife who is required  to
  file  a  separate New York income tax return shall be permitted one-half
  the credit otherwise allowed his or her household, except as limited  by
  paragraph one of this subsection.
    (c) Credit for certain household and dependent care services necessary
  for gainful employment.
    (1)  A  taxpayer shall be allowed a credit as provided herein equal to
  the  applicable  percentage  of  the  credit  allowable  under   section
  twenty-one  of  the  internal  revenue  code  for  the same taxable year
  (without regard to whether the taxpayer in fact claimed the credit under
  such  section  twenty-one  for  such  taxable  year).   The   applicable
  percentage  shall be the sum of (i) twenty percent and (ii) a multiplier
  multiplied by a  fraction.  For  taxable  years  beginning  in  nineteen
  hundred  ninety-six  and nineteen hundred ninety-seven, the numerator of
  such fraction shall be the lesser of (i) four thousand dollars  or  (ii)
  fourteen  thousand  dollars  less the New York adjusted gross income for
  the taxable year, provided, however, the numerator  shall  not  be  less
  than   zero.   For  the  taxable  year  beginning  in  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-eight, the numerator of such fraction shall be the lesser of  (i)
  thirteen  thousand  dollars or (ii) thirty thousand dollars less the New
  York adjusted gross income for the taxable year, provided, however,  the
  numerator  shall  not  be less than zero. For taxable years beginning in
  nineteen hundred ninety-nine, the numerator of such  fraction  shall  be
  the  lesser  of  (i)  fifteen  thousand  dollars  or (ii) fifty thousand
  dollars less the New York adjusted gross income for  the  taxable  year,
  provided,  however,  the  numerator  shall  not  be  less than zero. For
  taxable  years  beginning  after  nineteen  hundred   ninety-nine,   the
  numerator  of  such fraction shall be the lesser of (i) fifteen thousand
  dollars or (ii) sixty-five thousand dollars less the New  York  adjusted
  gross  income  for  the  taxable  year, provided, however, the numerator
  shall not be less than zero. The denominator of such fraction  shall  be
  four  thousand  dollars  for taxable years beginning in nineteen hundred
  ninety-six and nineteen hundred ninety-seven, thirteen thousand  dollars
  for  the  taxable  year  beginning in nineteen hundred ninety-eight, and
  fifteen thousand dollars for  taxable  years  beginning  after  nineteen


 hundred  ninety-eight.  The  multiplier shall be ten percent for taxable
  years beginning  in  nineteen  hundred  ninety-six,  forty  percent  for
  taxable  years  beginning  in  nineteen hundred ninety-seven, and eighty
  percent for taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred ninety-seven.
  Provided,  however,  for  taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred
  ninety-nine, for a person whose New York adjusted gross income  is  less
  than  forty  thousand dollars, such applicable percentage shall be equal
  to (i) one hundred percent,  plus  (ii)  ten  percent  multiplied  by  a
  fraction  whose  numerator  shall  be the lesser of (i) fifteen thousand
  dollars or (ii) forty thousand dollars less the New York adjusted  gross
  income  for  the taxable year, provided such numerator shall not be less
  than zero, and whose denominator  shall  be  fifteen  thousand  dollars.
  Provided,  further,  that  if  the  reversion  event, as defined in this
  paragraph, occurs, the applicable percentage shall,  for  taxable  years
  ending  on  or  after the date on which the reversion event occurred, be
  determined using the rules specified in  this  paragraph  applicable  to
  taxable  years  beginning in nineteen hundred ninety-nine. The reversion
  event shall be deemed to have occurred on  the  date  on  which  federal
  action,  including  but  not  limited  to,  administrative, statutory or
  regulatory changes, materially reduces or eliminates  New  York  state's
  allocation  of the federal temporary assistance for needy families block
  grant, or materially reduces the ability of the state to  spend  federal
  temporary assistance for needy families block grant funds for the credit
  for  certain household and dependent care services necessary for gainful
  employment or to apply state general fund spending  on  the  credit  for
  certain  household  and  dependent  care  services necessary for gainful
  employment toward the temporary  assistance  for  needy  families  block
  grant  maintenance  of  effort  requirement, and the commissioner of the
  office of temporary and disability assistance shall certify the date  of
  such  event  to  the  commissioner,  the director of the division of the
  budget, the speaker of the assembly and the temporary president  of  the
  senate.
    (1-a)  For taxable years beginning after two thousand seventeen, for a
  taxpayer with New York adjusted gross income of at least fifty  thousand
  dollars but less than one hundred fifty thousand dollars, the applicable
  percentage  shall  be the applicable percentage otherwise computed under
  paragraph one of this subsection multiplied by a factor as follows:
    If New York adjusted gross
    income is:                                         The factor is:
    At least $50,000 and less
    than $55,000                                       1.1682
    At least $55,000 and less
    than $60,000                                       1.2733
    At least $60,000 and less
    than $65,000                                       2.322
    At least $65,000 and less
    than $150,000                                      3.000
    (1-b) Notwithstanding anything in this subsection to the  contrary,  a
  taxpayer  shall be allowed a credit as provided in this subsection equal
  to the applicable percentage  of  the  credit  allowable  under  section
  twenty-one  of  the  internal  revenue  code  for  the same taxable year
  (without regard to whether the taxpayer in fact claimed the credit under
  such section twenty-one for such taxable  year)  that  would  have  been
  allowed  absent  the  application  of  section  21(c)  of  such code for
  taxpayers with more than two qualifying individuals,  provided  however,
  that  the  credit  shall  be calculated as if the dollar limit on amount
  creditable shall not exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars if there
  are three qualifying individuals, eight thousand five hundred dollars if


 there are four qualifying individuals,  and  nine  thousand  dollars  if
  there are five or more qualifying individuals.
    (2)  Residents.  In  the case of a resident taxpayer, the credit under
  this subsection shall be allowed  against  the  taxes  imposed  by  this
  article  for  the  taxable year reduced by the credits permitted by this
  article.  If the credit exceeds the tax as so reduced, the taxpayer  may
  receive,   and   the  comptroller,  subject  to  a  certificate  of  the
  commissioner, shall pay as an overpayment, without interest, the  amount
  of such excess.
    (3)  Nonresidents.  In  the case of a nonresident taxpayer, the credit
  under this subsection shall be allowed against the tax determined  under
  subsections  (a)  through  (d) of section six hundred one. The amount of
  the credit shall not exceed the tax determined  under  such  subsections
  for  the  taxable  year reduced by the credit permitted under subsection
  (b) of this section.
    (4) Part-year residents. In the case of a part-year resident taxpayer,
  the credit under this  subsection  shall  be  allowed  against  the  tax
  determined  under subsections (a) through (d) of section six hundred one
  reduced by the credit permitted under subsection (b)  of  this  section,
  and  any  excess  credit after such application shall be allowed against
  the tax imposed by section six  hundred  three.  Any  remaining  excess,
  after  such  application, shall be refunded as provided in paragraph two
  hereof, provided, however, that any  overpayment  under  such  paragraph
  shall  be  limited to the amount of the remaining excess multiplied by a
  fraction, the numerator of which is federal adjusted  gross  income  for
  the  period  of  residence,  computed as if the taxable year for federal
  income tax purposes were limited to the period  of  residence,  and  the
  denominator  of  which  is federal adjusted gross income for the taxable
  year.
    (5) In the case of a husband and wife who file a joint federal return,
  but who are required to determine their New York taxes  separately,  the
  credit  allowed  pursuant to this subsection may only be applied against
  the tax imposed on the spouse with the lower  taxable  income,  computed
  without regard to such credit. In the case of a husband and wife who are
  not  required to file a federal return, the credit under this subsection
  shall be allowed only if such taxpayers file a joint New York income tax
  return.
    (c-1) Empire state child credit.   (1) A resident  taxpayer  shall  be
  allowed  a credit as provided herein equal to the greater of one hundred
  dollars times the number of qualifying children of the taxpayer  or  the
  applicable percentage of the child tax credit allowed the taxpayer under
  section  twenty-four  of  the internal revenue code for the same taxable
  year for each qualifying child. Provided, however,  in  the  case  of  a
  taxpayer  whose  federal  adjusted  gross  income exceeds the applicable
  threshold amount set forth by section 24(b)(2) of the  Internal  Revenue
  Code, the credit shall only be equal to the applicable percentage of the
  child  tax  credit allowed the taxpayer under section 24 of the Internal
  Revenue Code for  each  qualifying  child.  For  the  purposes  of  this
  subsection, a qualifying child shall be a child who meets the definition
  of qualified child under section 24(c) of the internal revenue code. The
  applicable  percentage  shall  be  thirty-three percent. For purposes of
  this subsection, any reference to section 24  of  the  Internal  Revenue
  Code  shall  be  a  reference  to such section as it existed immediately
  prior to the enactment of Public Law 115-97.
    (2) If the amount of the credit allowed under this subsection for  any
  taxable  year  shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year, the excess
  shall be treated as an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded  in


 accordance with the provisions of section six hundred eighty-six of this
  article, provided, however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.
    (3) In the case of a husband and wife who file a joint federal return,
  but  who  are required to determine their New York taxes separately, the
  credit allowed pursuant to this subsection may be  applied  against  the
  tax imposed of either or divided between them as they may elect.
    (4)  (A)  For tax year two thousand twenty-one, the commissioner shall
  issue a payment of a supplemental  empire  state  child  credit  in  the
  amount  of  (i)  one  hundred  percent  of the empire state child credit
  calculated and allowed pursuant to this subsection  to  taxpayers  whose
  federal  adjusted  gross income was less than ten thousand dollars; (ii)
  seventy-five percent of the empire state  child  credit  calculated  and
  allowed  pursuant to this subsection to taxpayers whose federal adjusted
  gross income was greater than or equal to ten thousand dollars but  less
  than  twenty-five  thousand  dollars;  (iii) fifty percent of the empire
  state child credit calculated and allowed pursuant to this subsection to
  taxpayers whose federal adjusted gross income was greater than or  equal
  to  twenty-five  thousand  dollars but less than fifty thousand dollars;
  and (iv) twenty-five percent of the empire state child credit calculated
  and allowed pursuant to  this  subsection  to  taxpayers  whose  federal
  adjusted  gross  income  was  greater  than  or  equal to fifty thousand
  dollars. Provided, however, that no payment shall be  issued  if  it  is
  less than twenty-five dollars.
    (B)  The  supplemental  payment  pursuant  to  this  paragraph will be
  allowed to taxpayers who timely filed returns pursuant  to  section  six
  hundred  fifty-one of this article, determined with regard to extensions
  pursuant to section sex hundred fifty-seven of this article.
    (d) Earned income credit. (1) General. A taxpayer shall be  allowed  a
  credit  as provided herein equal to (i) the applicable percentage of the
  earned income credit allowed under section thirty-two  of  the  internal
  revenue  code  for  the  same  taxable  year, (ii) reduced by the credit
  permitted under subsection (b) of this section.
    The applicable percentage shall be (i) seven and one-half percent  for
  taxable  years  beginning  in  nineteen  hundred  ninety-four,  (ii) ten
  percent for taxable years beginning  in  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five,
  (iii)  twenty percent for taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred
  ninety-five and  before  two  thousand,  (iv)  twenty-two  and  one-half
  percent  for  taxable  years  beginning in two thousand, (v) twenty-five
  percent  for  taxable  years  beginning  in  two  thousand   one,   (vi)
  twenty-seven  and  one-half  percent  for taxable years beginning in two
  thousand two, and (vii) thirty percent for taxable  years  beginning  in
  two  thousand  three  and  thereafter.  Provided,  however,  that if the
  reversion event, as defined in this paragraph,  occurs,  the  applicable
  percentage  shall be twenty percent for taxable years ending on or after
  the date on which the reversion  event  occurred.  The  reversion  event
  shall  be  deemed  to have occurred on the date on which federal action,
  including but not limited to, administrative,  statutory  or  regulatory
  changes, materially reduces or eliminates New York state's allocation of
  the  federal  temporary  assistance  for  needy families block grant, or
  materially reduces the ability of the state to spend  federal  temporary
  assistance  for  needy  families block grant funds for the earned income
  credit or to apply state general fund  spending  on  the  earned  income
  credit  toward  the  temporary assistance for needy families block grant
  maintenance of effort requirement, and the commissioner of the office of
  temporary and disability assistance shall certify the date of such event
  to the commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance,  the  director  of  the
  division  of  the  budget, the speaker of the assembly and the temporary
  president of the senate.


   (2) Residents. In the case of a resident taxpayer,  the  credit  under
  this  subsection  shall  be  allowed  against  the taxes imposed by this
  article for the taxable year reduced by the credits  permitted  by  this
  article.   If the credit exceeds the tax as so reduced, the taxpayer may
  receive,   and   the  comptroller,  subject  to  a  certificate  of  the
  commissioner, shall pay as an overpayment, without interest, the  amount
  of such excess.
    (3)  Nonresidents.  In  the case of a nonresident taxpayer, the credit
  under this subsection shall be allowed against the tax determined  under
  subsections  (a)  through  (d) of section six hundred one. The amount of
  the credit shall not exceed the tax determined  under  such  subsections
  for  the taxable year reduced by the credits permitted under subsections
  (b), (c) and (m) of this section.
    (4) Part-year residents. In the case of a part-year resident taxpayer,
  the credit under this  subsection  shall  be  allowed  against  the  tax
  determined  under subsections (a) through (d) of section six hundred one
  reduced by the credits permitted under subsections (b), (c) and  (m)  of
  this  section,  and  any  excess  credit after such application shall be
  allowed against the tax  imposed  by  section  six  hundred  three.  Any
  remaining  excess, after such application, shall be refunded as provided
  in paragraph two hereof, provided, however, that any  overpayment  under
  such  paragraph  shall  be limited to the amount of the remaining excess
  multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of  which  is  federal  adjusted
  gross  income  for  the  period of residence, computed as if the taxable
  year for federal income tax purposes  were  limited  to  the  period  of
  residence, and the denominator of which is federal adjusted gross income
  for the taxable year.
    (5)  Husband  and  wife.  In the case of a husband and wife who file a
  joint federal return but who are required to determine  their  New  York
  taxes  separately, the credit allowed pursuant to this subsection may be
  applied against the tax of either or divided between them  as  they  may
  elect.
    (6)  Notification.  (A)  The  commissioner shall periodically, but not
  less than every three years, make efforts to alert taxpayers that may be
  currently eligible to receive the credit provided under this subsection,
  and the  credit  provided  under  any  local  law  enacted  pursuant  to
  subsection  (f)  of  section thirteen hundred ten of this chapter, as to
  their potential eligibility. In making the determination  of  whether  a
  taxpayer  may  be  eligible  for such credit, the commissioner shall use
  such data as may  be  appropriate  and  available,  including,  but  not
  limited  to,  data  available  from  the  United  States  Department  of
  Treasury, Internal Revenue Service and New York state income tax returns
  for preceding tax years.
    (B) If the department determines that  the  taxpayer  is  eligible  to
  receive  the  credit  provided under this subsection but has not claimed
  such credit on his or her  return,  the  department  shall  compute  the
  taxpayer's liability and allow the credit, and, if applicable, issue any
  refund  for  the allowable credit amount provided under this subsection.
  Any refund paid pursuant to this subparagraph shall be deemed  to  be  a
  refund  of  an  overpayment  of  tax  as provided in section six hundred
  eighty-six of this article, provided, however, that no interest shall be
  paid thereon.
    (7) Reports. The commissioner  shall  prepare  a  preliminary  written
  report after July thirty-first and a final written report after December
  thirty-first  of  each  calendar  year,  which shall contain statistical
  information regarding the credits granted on or before such dates  under
  this  subsection, and under any local law enacted pursuant to subsection
  (f) of section  thirteen  hundred  ten  of  this  chapter,  during  such


 calendar  year.  Copies  of  these  reports  shall  be submitted by such
  commissioner to the governor, the temporary president of the senate, the
  speaker of the assembly, the chairman of the  senate  finance  committee
  and  the  chairman of the assembly ways and means committee within sixty
  days of July thirty-first with respect to the  preliminary  report,  and
  within  forty-five  days  of  December  thirty-first with respect to the
  final report, and copies of such reports with respect to  credits  under
  any  local  law  enacted  pursuant to subsection (f) of section thirteen
  hundred ten of this chapter shall be submitted in addition to the  mayor
  and  the speaker of the council of the city where such a local law is in
  effect. Such reports shall contain, but need  not  be  limited  to,  the
  number of credits and the average amount of such credits allowed; and of
  those,  the  number  of  credits  and the average amount of such credits
  allowed to taxpayers in each county; and of those, the number of credits
  and the average amount of such credits allowed to taxpayers whose earned
  income falls within ranges, determined by the commissioner, of not  more
  than  four thousand dollars; and of those, the number of credits and the
  average amount of such credits allowed to taxpayers who file  under  the
  different  statuses set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of section
  six hundred one of this part; and of those, the number  of  credits  and
  the  average amount of such credits allowed to taxpayers whose number of
  qualifying children falls  within  the  categories  set  forth  in  such
  section thirty-two of the internal revenue code.
    (8) For tax year two thousand twenty-one, the commissioner shall issue
  a  payment  of  a  supplemental  earned  income  tax  credit to resident
  taxpayers in the amount of twenty-five percent of the earned income  tax
  credit  calculated and allowed pursuant to this subsection. Such payment
  will be allowed to resident taxpayers who timely filed returns  pursuant
  to section six hundred fifty-one of this article, determined with regard
  to  extensions  pursuant  to  section  six  hundred  fifty-seven of this
  article.  Provided, however, that no payment shall be issued  if  it  is
  less than twenty-five dollars.
    (d-1)  Enhanced  earned income tax credit. (1) A taxpayer described in
  paragraph two of this subsection shall be allowed a credit equal to  the
  greater of:
    (A)  twenty percent of the amount of the earned income tax credit that
  would have been allowed to the taxpayer under section 32 of the internal
  revenue code, absent the application  of  section  32(b)(2)(B)  of  such
  code,  if  the  child  or  children  described  in  subparagraph  (C) of
  paragraph two of  this  subsection  satisfied  the  requirements  for  a
  qualifying  child  set  forth in section 32(c)(3) of such code, provided
  however, that the credit shall be calculated as if the taxpayer had only
  one child; or
    (B) the product of two and one-half  and  the  amount  of  the  earned
  income  tax  credit  that  would have been allowed to the taxpayer under
  section 32 of the internal revenue code, if the taxpayer  satisfied  the
  eligibility  requirements  set  forth in section 32(c)(1)(A)(ii) of such
  code.
    (2) To be allowed a credit under  this  subsection,  a  taxpayer  must
  satisfy all of the following qualifications.
    (A) The taxpayer must be a resident taxpayer.
    (B) The taxpayer must have attained the age of eighteen.
    (C)  The taxpayer must be the parent of a minor child or children with
  whom the taxpayer does not reside.
    (D) The taxpayer must have an order requiring him or her to make child
  support payments, which are payable through a  support  collection  unit
  established  pursuant  to  section  one  hundred  eleven-h of the social


 services law, which order must have been in effect for at least one-half
  of the taxable year.
    (E)  The  taxpayer  must  have  paid an amount in child support in the
  taxable year at least equal to the amount of current child  support  due
  during  the  taxable  year  for every order requiring him or her to make
  child support payments.
    (3) If the amount of the credit allowed under  this  subsection  shall
  exceed  the taxpayer's tax for such year, the excess shall be treated as
  an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded in accordance with  the
  provisions  of section six hundred eighty-six of this article, provided,
  however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.
    (4) No claim for credit under this subsection shall be allowed  unless
  the  department has verified, from information provided by the office of
  temporary and disability assistance, that a taxpayer has  satisfied  the
  qualifications  set forth in subparagraphs (C), (D) and (E) of paragraph
  two  of  this  subsection.  The  office  of  temporary  and   disability
  assistance  shall provide to the department by January fifteenth of each
  year information applicable  for  the  immediately  preceding  tax  year
  necessary for the department to make such verification. Such information
  shall  be  provided in the manner and form agreed upon by the department
  and such  office.  If  a  taxpayer's  claim  for  a  credit  under  this
  subsection  is  disallowed  because  the  taxpayer has not satisfied the
  qualifications set forth in subparagraphs (C), (D) and (E) of  paragraph
  two  of  this  subsection,  the  taxpayer  may request a review of those
  qualifications by the support collection unit  established  pursuant  to
  section  one  hundred  eleven-h of the social services law through which
  the child support payments were payable.  The  support  collection  unit
  shall  transmit the result of that review to the office of temporary and
  disability assistance on a form developed by such  office.  Such  office
  shall  then  transmit  such  result to the department in a manner agreed
  upon by the department and such office.
    (5) A taxpayer shall  not  be  allowed  multiple  credits  under  this
  subsection  for  a  taxable year even if such taxpayer has more than one
  child or has more than one order requiring him  or  her  to  make  child
  support payments.
    (6)  If  a credit is allowed under this subsection and the taxpayer is
  also allowed a credit under subsection (d) of this section, the taxpayer
  shall only be allowed to claim one credit.
    (7) In the report prepared pursuant to paragraph seven  of  subsection
  (d)   of  this  section,  the  commissioner  shall  include  statistical
  information concerning the credit allowed pursuant to  this  subsection.
  Such  information  shall  be  limited  to  the number of credits and the
  average amount of such credits allowed; and  of  those,  the  number  of
  credits  and the average amounts of such credits allowed to taxpayers in
  each county.
    (8) In a report prepared by the  commissioner  and  submitted  to  the
  office  of  temporary  and  disability  assistance, the department shall
  include information concerning  the  credit  allowed  pursuant  to  this
  subsection  indicating whether or not taxpayers identified by the office
  of temporary and disability assistance pursuant  to  paragraph  four  of
  this subsection filed an income tax return, filed for a credit, received
  a  credit,  and  the  amount of any such credit. Any individual taxpayer
  information furnished by the department pursuant to this  section  shall
  be  deemed  confidential and may not be disclosed to any third party and
  the office of temporary and disability  assistance  is  prohibited  from
  using  the  individual  taxpayer  information  except for the purpose of
  analyzing the impact of the credit  and  its  effect  on  child  support
  payments.


   (9) For tax year two thousand twenty-one, the commissioner shall issue
  a  payment  of  a  supplemental enhanced earned income tax credit in the
  amount of twenty-five percent of the enhanced earned income  tax  credit
  calculated and allowed pursuant to this subsection. Such payment will be
  allowed  to  taxpayers  who timely filed returns pursuant to section six
  hundred fifty-one of this article, determined with regard to  extensions
  pursuant  to  section six hundred fifty-seven of this article. Provided,
  however, that no payment shall be issued if it is less than  twenty-five
  dollars.

  penalties  and interest, levied on the residence of a qualified taxpayer
  and  paid  during  the  taxable  year  less  the  credit  claimed  under
  subsection  (n-1)  of  this  section.  In  addition,  for  taxable years
  beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred  eighty-four,  a
  qualified taxpayer may elect to include any additional amount that would
  have  been  levied  in  the  absence  of an exemption from real property
  taxation pursuant to  section  four  hundred  sixty-seven  of  the  real
  property  tax  law.  If  tenant-stockholders  in  a  cooperative housing
  corporation have met the requirements of section two hundred sixteen  of
  the internal revenue code by which they are allowed a deduction for real
  estate  taxes,  the  amount  of  taxes  so  allowable, or which would be
  allowable if the taxpayer had filed returns on a cash  basis,  shall  be
  qualifying  real  property taxes. If a residence is owned by two or more
  individuals as joint tenants or tenants in common, and one or more  than
  one  individual  is  not  a  member  of  the  household, qualifying real
  property taxes is that  part  of  such  taxes  on  the  residence  which
  reflects  the ownership percentage of the qualified taxpayer and members
  of his household. If a residence is an integral part of a  larger  unit,
  qualifying  real  property taxes shall be limited to that amount of such
  taxes paid as may be reasonably apportioned  to  such  residence.  If  a
  household  owns  and  occupies  two  or more residences during different
  periods in the same taxable year, qualifying real property  taxes  shall
  be  the  sum of the prorated qualifying real property taxes attributable
  to the household during the periods such household occupies each of such
  residences. If the household owns and occupies a residence for  part  of
  the  taxable  year  and  rents  a residence for part of the same taxable
  year, it may include both the  proration  of  qualifying  real  property
  taxes  on  the residence owned and the real property tax equivalent with
  respect to the months the residence is rented.  Provided,  however,  for
  purposes  of  the  credit allowed under this subsection, qualifying real
  property taxes may be included by  a  qualified  taxpayer  only  to  the
  extent  that such taxpayer or the spouse of such taxpayer occupying such
  residence for six months or more of the taxable year owns or  has  owned
  the residence and paid such taxes.
    (F)  "Real  property  tax equivalent" means twenty-five percent of the
  adjusted rent actually paid in the taxable year by  a  household  solely
  for  the  right  of  occupancy of its New York residence for the taxable
  year. If (i) a residence  is  rented  to  two  or  more  individuals  as
  cotenants, or such individuals share in the payment of a single rent for
  the  right  of  occupancy  of  such  residence,  and  (ii)  each of such
  individuals is a member of a different household, one or more  of  which
  individuals  shares such residence, real property tax equivalent is that
  portion of twenty-five percent of the adjusted rent paid in the  taxable
  year  which  reflects  that  portion  of  the  rent  attributable to the
  qualified taxpayer and the members of his household.
    (G) "Adjusted rent" means rental paid for the right of occupancy of  a
  residence, excluding charges for heat, gas, electricity, furnishings and
  board. Where charges for heat, gas, electricity, furnishing or board are
  included in rental but where such charges and the amount thereof are not
  separately  set  forth  in  a  written rental agreement, for purposes of
  determining adjusted rent the qualified  taxpayer  shall  reduce  rental
  paid as follows:
    (i) For heat, or heat and gas, deduct fifteen percent of rental paid.


   (ii)  For  heat,  gas and electricity, deduct twenty percent of rental
  paid.
    (iii)  For  heat, gas, electricity and furnishings, deduct twenty-five
  percent of rental paid.
    (iv) For heat, gas, electricity, furnishings and board,  deduct  fifty
  percent of rental paid.
  If  the  tax  commission  determines that the adjusted rent shown on the
  return is excessive, the  tax  commission  may  reduce  such  rent,  for
  purposes  of  the  computation of the credit, to an amount substantially
  equivalent to rent for a comparable accommodation.
    (2) A qualified taxpayer shall be allowed  a  credit  as  provided  in
  paragraph three hereof against the taxes imposed by this article reduced
  by  the credits permitted by this article. If the credit exceeds the tax
  as so reduced for such year under this article  the  qualified  taxpayer
  may  receive, and the comptroller, subject to a certificate of the state
  tax commission, shall pay  as  an  overpayment,  without  interest,  any
  excess between such tax as so reduced and the amount of the credit. If a
  qualified  taxpayer is not required to file a return pursuant to section
  six hundred fifty-one, a qualified taxpayer may nevertheless receive and
  the comptroller, subject to a certificate of the state  tax  commission,
  shall  pay  as  an  overpayment  the  full amount of the credit, without
  interest.
    (3) Determination of credit. (A)  For  qualified  taxpayers  who  have
  attained  the  age of sixty-five years before the beginning of or during
  the  taxable  year  the  amount  of  the  credit  allowable  under  this
  subsection  shall  be  fifty  percent,  or  in  the  case of a qualified
  taxpayer who has elected to include an  additional  amount  pursuant  to
  subparagraph  (E)  of  paragraph  one  of  this  subsection, twenty-five
  percent, of the excess of real property taxes  or  the  excess  of  real
  property tax equivalent determined as follows:
 
                                       Excess real property taxes are the
                                       excess of real property tax equiv-
                                       alent or the excess of qualifying
                                       real property taxes over  the  fo-
  If household gross income for the    llowing percentage of household
  taxable year is:                     gross income:
  -----------------------------------  -----------------------------------

  Over $14,000 but not over $18,000                   6 1/2
 
    Notwithstanding   the   foregoing   provisions,   the  maximum  credit
  determined under this subparagraph may not exceed the amount  determined
  in accordance with the following table:

  property  taxes  or  the  excess  of  the  real  property tax equivalent

                                       alent or the excess of qualifying
                                       real property taxes over the
  If household gross income for the    following percentage of household
  taxable year is:                     gross income:

    (4)  If a qualified taxpayer occupies a residence for a period of less
  than twelve months during the taxable  year  or  occupies  two  or  more
  residences  during  different  periods  in such taxable year, the credit
  allowed pursuant to this subsection shall be computed in such manner  as
  the  tax  commission  may, by regulation, prescribe in order to properly
  reflect the credit or portion thereof attributable to such residence  or
  residences and such period or periods.
    (5)  The  tax  commission  may  prescribe  that  the credit under this
  subsection shall be determined in whole or in part by the use of  tables
  prescribed by such commission. Such tables shall set forth the credit to
  the nearest dollar.
    (6)  Only one credit per household and per qualified taxpayer shall be
  allowed per taxable year under this subsection. When two or more members
  of a household are able to  meet  the  qualifications  for  a  qualified
  taxpayer,  the  credit  shall  be  equally divided between or among such
  individuals unless such individuals  file  with  the  tax  commission  a
  written  agreement  among  such  individuals  setting  forth a different
  division. Where two or more members of a household are able to meet  the
  qualifications  of  a  qualified  taxpayer and one of them is sixty-five
  years of age or more, the credit which may be taken shall be the  credit
  applicable to individuals who have attained the age of sixty-five years.
    (A)  Provided, however, where a joint income tax return has been filed
  pursuant to the  provisions  of  section  six  hundred  fifty-one  by  a
  qualified  taxpayer  and his spouse (or where both spouses are qualified
  taxpayers and have filed such joint return), the credit, or the  portion
  of  the  credit  if  divided, to which the husband and wife are entitled
  shall be applied against the tax of both  spouses  and  any  overpayment
  shall be made to both spouses.
    (B)  Where  any return required to be filed pursuant to the provisions
  of section six hundred fifty-one is combined  with  any  return  of  tax
  imposed  pursuant  to  the authority of this chapter or any other law if
  such tax is administered by  the  tax  commission,  the  credit  or  the
  portion  of the credit if divided, allowed to the qualified taxpayer may
  be  applied  by  the  tax  commission  toward  any  liability  for   the
  aforementioned taxes.
    (7) No credit shall be granted under this subsection:
    (A)  If  household  gross income for the taxable year exceeds eighteen
  thousand dollars.
    (B) To  a  property  owner  unless:  (i)  the  property  is  used  for
  residential  purposes,  (ii)  not more than twenty percent of the rental
  income, if any, from the property  is  from  rental  for  nonresidential
  purposes  and  (iii) the property is occupied as a residence in whole or
  in part by one or more of the owners of the property.
    (C) To a property owner who owns real  property,  the  full  value  of
  which exceeds eighty-five thousand dollars.
    (D)  To  a  tenant if the adjusted rent for the residence exceeds four
  hundred fifty dollars per month on average.
    (E) To an individual with respect to whom a deduction under subsection
  (c) of section one hundred fifty-one of the  internal  revenue  code  is
  allowable to another taxpayer for the taxable year.
    (F)  With  respect  to  a  residence that is wholly exempted from real
  property taxation.
    (G) To an individual who is not a resident individual of the state for
  the entire taxable year.


   (8) The right to claim a credit or the portion of a credit, where such
  credit has been divided under this subsection, shall be personal to  the
  qualified  taxpayer  and shall not survive his death, but such right may
  be exercised on behalf of a claimant by his legal guardian  or  attorney
  in fact during his lifetime.
    (9)  Returns. If a qualified taxpayer is not required to file a return
  pursuant to section six hundred fifty-one, a claim for a credit  may  be
  taken  on a return filed with the tax commission within three years from
  the time it would have been required that a return be filed pursuant  to
  such  section  had  the  qualified taxpayer had a taxable year ending on
  December thirty-first. Returns under this paragraph  shall  be  in  such
  form  as  shall  be  prescribed  by the tax commission, which shall make
  available such forms and instructions for filing such returns.
    (10) Proof of claim.  The  tax  commission  may  require  a  qualified
  taxpayer  to  furnish  the following information in support of his claim
  for credit under this subsection: household  gross  income,  rent  paid,
  name and address of owner or managing agent of the property rented, real
  property  taxes  levied or that would have been levied in the absence of
  an exemption from real property tax pursuant  to  section  four  hundred
  sixty-seven  of  the  real property tax law, the names of members of the
  household and other qualifying taxpayers occupying  the  same  residence
  and   their  identifying  numbers  including  social  security  numbers,
  household gross income, size and nature of property claimed as residence
  and all other information which may be required by the tax commission to
  determine the credit.
    (11) Administration. The provisions of  this  article,  including  the
  provisions  of section six hundred fifty-three, six hundred fifty-eight,
  and six hundred fifty-nine and  the  provisions  of  part  six  of  this
  article relating to procedure and administration, including the judicial
  review of the decisions of the tax commission, except so much of section
  six  hundred  eighty-seven which permits a claim for credit or refund to
  be filed after the  period  provided  for  in  paragraph  nine  of  this
  subsection  and  except  sections  six  hundred fifty-seven, six hundred
  eighty-eight and six hundred ninety-six, shall apply to  the  provisions
  of this subsection in the same manner and with the same force and effect
  as  if  the  language  of those provisions had been incorporated in full
  into this subsection and had expressly referred to the credit allowed or
  returns filed under this subsection, except to the extent that any  such
  provision  is either inconsistent with a provision of this subsection or
  is not relevant to this subsection. As used in such  sections  and  such
  part,  the term "taxpayer" shall include a qualified taxpayer under this
  subsection and, notwithstanding the  provisions  of  subsection  (e)  of
  section  six  hundred  ninety-seven,  where  a  qualified  taxpayer  has
  protested the denial of a claim for credit under this subsection and the
  time to file a petition for  redetermination  of  a  deficiency  or  for
  refund  has  not expired, he shall, subject to such conditions as may be
  set by the  tax  commission,  receive  such  information  (A)  which  is
  contained  in  any  return  filed  under this article by a member of his
  household for the taxable year for which the credit is claimed, and  (B)
  which  the tax commission finds is relevant and material to the issue of
  whether such claim was properly denied. The tax  commission  shall  have
  the  authority  to  promulgate  such  rules  and  regulations  as may be
  necessary for the processing, determination and granting of credits  and
  refunds under this subsection.
    (13)  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this article, the credit
  allowed  under  this  subsection   shall   be   determined   after   the
  determination  and  application of any other credits permitted under the
  provisions of this article.


   (14)  The  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  shall  prepare  a
  preliminary  written  report after July thirty-first and a final written
  report after December thirty-first of each calendar  year,  which  shall
  contain  statistical  information  regarding  the  credits granted on or
  before  such  dates  under  this  subsection  during such calendar year.
  Copies of these reports shall be submitted by such commissioner  to  the
  governor,  the  temporary  president  of  the senate, the speaker of the
  assembly, the chairman of the senate finance committee and the  chairman
  of  the  assembly  ways  and  means  committee within sixty days of July
  thirty-first  with  respect  to  the  preliminary  report,  and   within
  forty-five  days  of  December  thirty-first  with  respect to the final
  report. Such reports shall contain, but need  not  be  limited  to,  the
  number of credits and the average amount of such credits allowed; and of
  those,  the  number  of  credits  and the average amount of such credits
  allowed to qualified taxpayers in each county; and of those, the  number
  of  credits  and the average amount of such credits allowed to qualified
  taxpayers  whose  household  gross  income  falls  within  each  of  the
  household  gross  income  ranges  set  forth  in paragraph three of this
  subsection; and of those, the number of credits and the  average  amount
  of such credits allowed to qualified taxpayers whose credit amount falls
  within credit amount ranges set forth in twenty-five dollar increments.
    (e-1)  Volunteer  firefighters' and ambulance workers' credit. (1) For
  taxable years beginning on and after January first, two thousand  seven,
  a  resident  taxpayer  who  serves as an active volunteer firefighter as
  defined in subdivision one of section two hundred fifteen of the general
  municipal  law  or  as  a  volunteer  ambulance  worker  as  defined  in
  subdivision  fourteen  of  section two hundred nineteen-k of the general
  municipal law shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by  this
  article  equal to two hundred dollars. In order to receive this credit a
  volunteer firefighter or  volunteer  ambulance  worker  must  have  been
  active for the entire taxable year for which the credit is sought.
    (2)  If  a taxpayer receives a real property tax exemption relating to
  such service under title two of article four of the  real  property  tax
  law,  such  taxpayer  shall  not  be eligible for this credit; provided,
  however (A) if the taxpayer receives such real property tax exemption in
  the two thousand seven taxable year as a result  of  making  application
  therefor  in  a  prior  year  or (B) if the taxpayer notifies his or her
  assessor in writing by December thirty-first, two thousand seven of  the
  taxpayer's intent to discontinue such real property tax exemption by not
  re-applying  for  such  real  property tax exemption by the next taxable
  status date, such taxpayer shall be eligible for this credit for the two
  thousand seven taxable year.
    (3) In the case of a husband and wife who file a joint return and  who
  both  individually  qualify  for  the  credit under this subsection, the
  amount of the credit allowed shall be four hundred dollars.
    (4) If the amount of the credit allowed under this subsection for  any
  taxable  year  shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year, the excess
  shall be treated as an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded  in
  accordance with the provisions of section six hundred eighty-six of this
  article, provided, however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.
    (e-2)  Real  property  tax  relief  credit.  (1)  For purposes of this
  subsection:
    (A) "Qualified taxpayer" means a resident individual of the state  who
  owned  and  primarily resided for six months or more of the taxable year
  in real property that either received the STAR exemption  authorized  by
  section  four  hundred  twenty-five of the real property tax law or that
  qualified  the  taxpayer  to  receive  the  school  tax  relief   credit
  authorized by subsection (eee) of this section.


   (B)  "Qualified  gross  income" means the adjusted gross income of the
  qualified taxpayer for the taxable year for federal income tax  purposes
  and, for taxable year two thousand twenty-one computed without regard to
  the  last  sentence  of  subdivision (a) of section six hundred seven of
  this  article.  In  computing  qualified gross income, the net amount of
  loss reported on Federal Schedule C, D, E, or F shall not  exceed  three
  thousand  dollars per schedule. In addition, the net amount of any other
  separate category of loss shall not exceed three thousand  dollars.  The
  aggregate  amount  of  all  losses included in computing qualified gross
  income shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars.
    (C) "Residence" means a dwelling in this state owned by  the  taxpayer

  the land abutting it, not exceeding one acre, as is reasonably necessary
  for  use  of  the  dwelling  as  a  home, and may consist of a part of a
  multi-dwelling or multi-purpose  building  including  a  cooperative  or
  condominium.   Residence   includes  a  trailer  or  mobile  home,  used
  exclusively for  residential  purposes  and  defined  as  real  property
  pursuant  to  paragraph (g) of subdivision twelve of section one hundred
  two of the real property tax law.
    (D) "Qualifying real property taxes" means all  real  property  taxes,
  special   ad  valorem  levies  and  special  assessments,  exclusive  of
  penalties and interest, levied by a taxing jurisdiction on the residence
  owned and occupied by a qualified taxpayer and  paid  by  the  qualified
  taxpayer  during the taxable year, provided that to the extent the total
  amount of real property taxes so paid includes  school  district  taxes,
  the  amount  of  the school tax relief (STAR) credit claimed pursuant to
  subsection (eee) of this section, if any, shall be  deducted  from  such
  amount.
    A  qualified  taxpayer may elect to include any additional amount that
  would have been  levied  by  a  taxing  jurisdiction  and  paid  by  the
  qualified  taxpayer  in  the  absence of an exemption from real property
  taxation pursuant to  section  four  hundred  sixty-seven  of  the  real
  property  tax  law.  If  tenant-stockholders  in  a  cooperative housing
  corporation have met the requirements of section two hundred sixteen  of
  the internal revenue code by which they are allowed a deduction for real
  estate  taxes,  the  amount  of  taxes  so  allowable, or which would be
  allowable if the taxpayer had filed returns on a cash  basis,  shall  be
  qualifying  real property taxes. If a residence is an integral part of a
  larger unit, qualifying real property taxes shall  be  limited  to  that
  amount  of  such  taxes  paid  as  may be reasonably apportioned to such
  residence. If a taxpayer owned and occupied two residences in the  state
  during  different  periods  in  the  same  taxable year, qualifying real
  property taxes shall be the sum of the prorated qualifying real property
  taxes attributable to the taxpayer  during  the  periods  such  taxpayer
  occupied  each  of  such residences. A taxpayer who owned and occupied a
  residence in the state for  part  of  the  taxable  year  and  rented  a
  residence  in  the  state for part of the same taxable year, may include
  the proration of qualifying real property taxes on the residence  owned.
  Provided,  however,  for  purposes  of  the  credit  allowed  under this
  subsection,  qualifying  real  property  taxes  may  be  included  by  a
  qualified  taxpayer  only to the extent that such taxpayer or the spouse
  of such taxpayer occupied such residence for  one  hundred  eighty-three
  days  or  more  of  the  taxable year, owned the residence and paid such
  taxes.
    (E) "Excess real property tax" means the  excess  of  qualifying  real
  property taxes over six percent of qualified gross income.
    (2)  For  tax  years beginning on or after January first, two thousand
  twenty-one  and  before  January  first,  two  thousand  twenty-four,  a


 qualified  taxpayer  shall  be allowed a credit as provided in paragraph
  three of this subsection against the taxes imposed by this  article.  If
  the  credit exceeds the tax for such year under this article, the excess
  shall  be treated as an overpayment, to be credited or refunded, without
  interest.
    (3) Determination of credit. The  credit  amount  allowed  under  this
  subsection  shall be the product of the excess real property tax and the
  applicable percentage of the excess real  property  tax,  calculated  as
  follows:
    (A)   For   qualified   taxpayers  whose  qualified  gross  income  is
  seventy-five thousand dollars or less, the applicable  percentage  shall
  be fourteen percent.
    (B)  For  qualified  taxpayers whose qualified gross income is greater
  than seventy-five thousand dollars but less than or equal to one hundred
  fifty  thousand  dollars,  the  applicable  percentage  shall   be   the
  difference between (i) fourteen percent and (ii) five percent multiplied
  by  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which is the difference between the
  qualified  taxpayer's  qualified  gross  income  as  defined   by   this
  subsection  and  seventy-five  thousand  dollars, and the denominator of
  which is seventy-five thousand dollars.
    (C) For qualified taxpayers whose qualified gross  income  is  greater
  than  one  hundred  fifty thousand dollars but less than or equal to two
  hundred fifty thousand dollars, the applicable percentage shall  be  the
  difference between (i) nine percent and (ii) six percent multiplied by a
  fraction, the numerator of which is the difference between the qualified
  taxpayer's  qualified  gross  income  and  one  hundred  fifty  thousand
  dollars, and the denominator of which is one hundred thousand dollars.
    (4) No credit shall be allowed under this  subsection  if  the  amount
  determined  pursuant  to  paragraph three is less than two hundred fifty
  dollars, provided further that if  the  amount  determined  pursuant  to
  paragraph three is in excess of three hundred fifty dollars the taxpayer
  shall be allowed a credit of three hundred fifty dollars.
    (5)  The  commissioner  may  prescribe  that  the  credit  under  this
  subsection shall be determined in whole or in part by the use of  tables
  prescribed  by such commissioner. Such tables shall set forth the credit
  to the nearest dollar.
    (6) No credit shall be granted under this subsection:
    (A) To a property owner if qualified gross income for the taxable year
  exceeds two hundred fifty thousand dollars.
    (B) To  a  property  owner  unless:  (i)  the  property  is  used  for
  residential  purposes;  (ii)  not more than twenty percent of the rental
  income, if any, from the property  is  from  rental  for  nonresidential
  purposes;  and (iii) the property is occupied as a residence in whole or
  in part by one or more of the owners of the property.
    (C) To an individual with respect to whom a deduction under subsection
  (c) of section one hundred fifty-one of the  internal  revenue  code  is
  allowable to another taxpayer for the taxable year.
    (D)  With  respect  to  a  residence that is wholly exempted from real
  property taxation.
    (E) To an individual who is not a resident individual of the state for
  the entire taxable year.
    (7) In the case of a taxpayer who has itemized deductions from federal
  adjusted gross income, and whose federal itemized deductions include  an
  amount  for  real  estate  taxes  paid,  the New York itemized deduction
  otherwise allowable under section six hundred fifteen  of  this  chapter
  shall  be  reduced  by  the  amount  of  the  credit  claimed under this
  subsection.


   (f) Credit for the special additional mortgage recording tax.  (1) For
  taxable years beginning before nineteen hundred eighty-eight, a taxpayer
  shall be allowed a credit, to be credited against  the  tax  imposed  by
  this  article,  after  allowance of any other credit provided under this
  section and any credits permitted under sections six hundred twenty, six
  hundred  twenty-one  and  six  hundred  thirty-five of this article. The
  amount of the credit shall be  the  amount  of  the  special  additional
  mortgage  recording  tax paid by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions
  of subdivision one-a of section two hundred fifty-three of this  chapter
  on  mortgages  recorded  on  and  after  January first, nineteen hundred
  seventy-nine. Provided, however, no credit shall be allowed with respect
  to a mortgage of real property principally improved or to be improved by
  one or more structures containing in the aggregate  not  more  than  six
  residential  dwelling  units, each dwelling unit having its own separate
  cooking facilities, where the real property is located in one or more of
  the  counties  comprising  the  metropolitan   commuter   transportation
  district  and  where  the  mortgage  is  recorded on or after May first,
  nineteen hundred eighty-seven. Provided, however,  no  credit  shall  be
  allowed with respect to a mortgage of real property principally improved
  or  to be improved by one or more structures containing in the aggregate
  not more than six residential dwelling units, each dwelling unit  having
  its  own separate cooking facilities, where the real property is located
  in the county of Erie and where the mortgage is recorded on or after May
  first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven.
    (2) In no event shall the amount of the credit herein provided for  be
  allowed  in  excess of the taxpayer's tax for such year. However, if the
  amount of credit otherwise  allowable  under  this  subsection  for  any
  taxable  year  results  in  such excess amount, any amount of credit not
  deductible in such taxable year may be carried  over  to  the  following
  year  or years and may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year
  or years.
    (3)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs  one  and  two  of
  this subsection, for taxable years beginning after two thousand three, a
  taxpayer  shall  be  allowed  a  credit,  to be credited against the tax
  imposed by this article, equal to the amount of the  special  additional
  mortgage  recording  tax  paid  by  the  taxpayer  or,  in the case of a
  taxpayer who is a partner in a partnership, the partner's pro rata share
  of the amount of the special additional mortgage recording tax  paid  by
  the  partnership,  pursuant  to  the  provisions of subdivision one-a of
  section two hundred fifty-three of this chapter on mortgages recorded on
  and after January first, two thousand four. Provided, however, no credit
  shall be allowed with respect to a mortgage of real property principally
  improved by one or more structures containing in the aggregate not  more
  than  six  residential dwelling units, each dwelling unit having its own
  separate cooking facilities, where the real property is located  in  one
  or   more   of   the   counties  comprising  the  metropolitan  commuter
  transportation district and where the mortgage is recorded on  or  after
  January  first,  two thousand four. Provided further, no credit shall be
  allowed with respect to a mortgage of real property principally improved
  by one or more structures containing in the aggregate not more than  six
  residential  dwelling  units, each dwelling unit having its own separate
  cooking facilities, where the real property is located  in  Erie  county
  and  where  the  mortgage  is  recorded  on  or after January first, two
  thousand four.
    (B) If the amount of credit allowable under  this  paragraph  for  any
  taxable  year  exceeds  the  taxpayer's tax for such year, any amount of
  credit exceeding such tax may be carried over to the following  year  or
  years  and  may  be  deducted  from  the taxpayer's tax for such year or


 years. Provided further, such taxpayer may elect to  treat  such  unused
  amount  of credit as an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded in
  accordance with the provisions of section six hundred eighty-six of this
  article except that no interest shall be paid on such overpayment.
    (g) Credit for solar and wind energy systems.
    (1)  A  taxpayer shall be allowed a credit for taxable years beginning
  on or after January first, nineteen hundred eighty-one and ending before
  December thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-six  against  the  tax
  imposed  by this article for the purchase and installation of a solar or
  wind energy system by a taxpayer in his  principal  residence,  if  such
  residence is located within the state. The amount of the credit shall be
  fifty-five  percent  of  the  expenditure  incurred  in  purchasing  and
  installing any such system or combination thereof, but not to exceed the
  maximum credit of two thousand seven hundred fifty dollars.
    (2) A solar or wind system is a system whose original use begins  with
  the  taxpayer;  which meets the eligibility criteria, if any, prescribed
  by the department of taxation and finance; and which is:
    (A) an active solar energy system which shall mean an  arrangement  or
  combination  of  components  designed  to  provide heating, cooling, hot
  water or electricity through the process of collecting solar  radiation,
  converting  it  to another form of energy, storing the converted energy,
  protecting  against  unnecessary  dissipation   and   distributing   the
  converted  energy,  and  which  requires  external  mechanical power for
  operation. This term shall not include pipes,  controls,  insulation  or
  other  equipment  which  are  part of the conventional heating, cooling,
  insulation or electrical system of a building; nor shall it include  any
  expenditure allocable to a swimming pool used as a storage medium;
    (B)  a  passive  solar  energy system, which shall mean a system which
  relies upon the  original  or  retrofitted  design  and  elements  of  a
  building to enhance the use of natural forces including solar radiation,
  winds  and  night-time coolness to provide heating, cooling or hot water
  through the process of collecting  solar  radiation,  converting  it  to
  another form of energy, storing the converted energy, protecting against
  unnecessary dissipation and distributing the converted energy, and which
  is  not  primarily  dependent  upon mechanical power for operation. This
  term shall not include pipes, controls, insulation  or  other  equipment
  which are part of the conventional heating, cooling or insulation system
  of  the  building;  nor  shall it include any expenditure allocable to a
  swimming pool used as a storage medium; or
    (C)  a  wind  energy  system,  which  shall  mean  an  arrangement  or
  combination  of  components,  including  power  conditioning  equipment,
  designed to provide electricity or mechanical energy through the process
  of converting wind energy into mechanical and/or  electric  energy,  and
  storing or distributing such energy.
    (3)  Where a solar or wind energy system is purchased and installed by
  a  condominium  management  association   or   a   cooperative   housing
  corporation,  a  taxpayer  who is a member of the condominium management
  association or who is a tenant-stockholder in  the  cooperative  housing
  corportion  may for the purpose of this subsection claim a proportionate
  share of the total expense as the expenditure for the  purposes  of  the
  credit attributable to his principal residence.
    (4)  Where  a  solar  or  wind  system is purchased and installed in a
  principal residence shared by two or more taxpayers the  amount  of  the
  credit  allowable  under this subsection for each such taxpayer shall be
  prorated according to the percentage of the total expenditure  for  such
  system contributed by each taxpayer.
    (5)  To  the  extent  that  a federal income tax credit shall apply to
  expenditures eligible for a credit under  this  subsection,  the  credit


 provided in this subsection shall be reduced so that the combined credit
  shall not exceed fifty-five percent of such expenditures or six thousand
  seven hundred fifty dollars, whichever is less.
    (6)  If  the  amount  of  credit allowable under this subsection shall
  exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year, the excess may be carried  over
  to  the  following year or years and may be deducted from the taxpayer's
  tax for such year or years.
    (7) If all  or  any  part  of  the  credit  provided  for  under  this
  subsection  was  allowed  or  carried  over from a prior taxable year or
  years, a taxpayer shall  reduce  the  allowable  credit  for  additional
  qualifying  expenditures  in  a subsequent tax year by the amount of the
  credit previously allowed or  carried  over;  provided  however  that  a
  credit  previously  allowed or carried over from a prior taxable year or
  years shall not be taken  into  account  in  determining  the  allowable
  credit  for  the  purchase  and  installation  of a solar or wind energy
  system in a subsequent principal residence.
    (8)  For  the  purpose  of  determining  the  amount  of  the   actual
  expenditure incurred in purchasing and installing a solar or wind energy
  system,  the amount of any federal, state or local grant received by the
  taxpayer, which was used for the purchase and/or  installation  of  such
  system  and  which was not included in the gross income of the taxpayer,
  shall not be taken into account.
    (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a credit is allowed
  under this subsection for a renewable energy system with respect to  any
  property, the increase in the basis of such property which would but for
  this  subsection  result  from  such expenditure shall be reduced by the
  amount of the credit allowed. When the sale or other disposition of such
  property results  in  the  nonrecognition  of  gain  under  section  one
  thousand  thirty-four  of  the  internal  revenue code, a like reduction
  shall be made to the basis of the new residence, if  such  residence  is
  located within the state.
    (g-1) Solar energy system equipment credit. (1) General. An individual
  taxpayer  shall  be  allowed  a  credit  against the tax imposed by this
  article equal to twenty-five percent of qualified  solar  energy  system

  under such agreement. Provided, however,  such  credits  shall  only  be
  allowed  for  fourteen  years after the first taxable year in which such
  credit is allowed. Provided further, however,  the  twenty-five  percent
  limitation  in  paragraph one of this subsection shall only apply to the
  total aggregate amount of  all  payments  to  be  made  pursuant  to  an
  agreement  referenced  in  clauses  (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) of
  this paragraph, and shall not apply to individual payments made during a
  taxable year under such agreement except to the extent  such  limitation
  on an aggregate basis has been reached.
    (3)  Solar  energy  system  equipment.  The  term "solar energy system

  medium. Solar energy system equipment that generates electricity for use
  in  a  residence  must  conform  to applicable requirements set forth in
  section sixty-six-j of the public service law. Provided, however,  where
  solar   energy   system  equipment  is  purchased  and  installed  by  a
  condominium management association or a cooperative housing corporation,
  for purposes of this subsection only, the term "ten kilowatts"  in  such
  section sixty-six-j shall be read as "fifty kilowatts."
    (4)  Multiple  taxpayers.  Where  solar  energy  system  equipment  is
  purchased and installed in a principal residence shared by two  or  more
  taxpayers,  the amount of the credit allowable under this subsection for
  each such taxpayer shall be prorated according to the percentage of  the
  total  expenditure for such solar energy system equipment contributed by
  each taxpayer.
    (5) Proportionate  share.  Where  solar  energy  system  equipment  is
  purchased  and  installed  by  a condominium management association or a
  cooperative housing corporation, a taxpayer  who  is  a  member  of  the
  condominium management association or who is a tenant-stockholder in the
  cooperative  housing  corporation may for the purpose of this subsection
  claim a proportionate share of the total expense as the expenditure  for
  the purposes of the credit attributable to his principal residence.
    (6)  Grants. For purposes of determining the amount of the expenditure
  incurred in purchasing and installing solar energy system equipment, the
  amount of any federal, state or local grant received  by  the  taxpayer,
  which  was  used  for the purchase and/or installation of such equipment
  and which was not included in the federal gross income of the  taxpayer,

  system equipment" shall mean a system whose original use begins with the
  taxpayer; which meets the eligibility criteria, if  any,  prescribed  by
  the  department; and which is a ground coupled solar thermal system that
  utilizes the solar thermal energy stored in the ground or in  bodies  of
  water  to produce heat, and which is commonly known as or referred to as
  a ground source heat pump system.
    (4) Multiple taxpayers. Where geothermal energy  system  equipment  is
  purchased  and installed in a residence shared by two or more taxpayers,
  the amount of the credit allowable under this subsection for  each  such
  taxpayer  shall  be  prorated  according  to the percentage of the total
  expenditure for such geothermal energy system equipment  contributed  by
  each taxpayer.
    (5)  Proportionate  share. Where geothermal energy system equipment is
  purchased and installed by a condominium  management  association  or  a
  cooperative  housing  corporation,  a  taxpayer  who  is a member of the
  condominium management association or who is a tenant-stockholder in the
  cooperative housing corporation may for the purpose of  this  subsection
  claim  a proportionate share of the total expense as the expenditure for
  the purposes of the credit attributable to the taxpayer's residence.
    (6) Grants. For purposes of determining the amount of the  expenditure
  incurred   in   purchasing   and  installing  geothermal  energy  system
  equipment, the amount of any federal, state or local grant  received  by
  the  taxpayer,  which  was  used for the purchase and/or installation of


 such equipment and which was not included in the federal gross income of
  the taxpayer, shall not be included in the amount of such expenditures.
    (7) Limitation. The credit shall only be allowed for geothermal energy
  system  equipment installed in connection with residential property used
  exclusively for personal purposes by the taxpayer. No  credit  shall  be
  allowed  for  geothermal energy system equipment installed in connection
  with residential property that is rented at any time during the  taxable
  year for which the credit is being claimed.
    (8)  When  credit  allowed.  The  credit  provided for herein shall be
  allowed with respect to the taxable year in which the geothermal  energy
  system  equipment  is  placed  in  service and shall be allowed only for
  geothermal energy system equipment placed  into  service  after  January
  first, two thousand twenty-two. However, the taxpayer shall be allowed a
  credit for only one such system in any taxable year.
    (9)  Carryover  of credit. If the amount of the credit, and carryovers
  of such credit, allowable under this subsection  for  any  taxable  year
  shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year, such excess amount may be
  carried  over  to the five taxable years next following the taxable year
  with respect to which the credit is allowed and may be deducted from the
  taxpayer's tax for such year or years.
    (h) Research and development  tax  credit.    (1)  For  taxable  years
  commencing  prior  to  January  first,  nineteen hundred eighty-seven, a
  taxpayer shall be allowed a credit  against  the  tax  imposed  by  this
  article  after allowance of any other credit provided under this section
  and any credits permitted under sections six hundred twenty, six hundred
  twenty-one and six hundred thirty-five of this article.  The  amount  of
  the  credit  shall be ten percent of the cost or other basis for federal
  income tax purposes of tangible personal property,  including  buildings
  and other structural components of buildings, described in paragraph two
  of  this  subsection  acquired, constructed or reconstructed, or erected
  after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-two.
    (2) A credit shall be allowed  under  this  section  with  respect  to
  tangible  personal  property  and  other  tangible  property,  including
  buildings and structural components of buildings which are:  depreciable
  pursuant  to  section  one  hundred  sixty-seven of the internal revenue
  code, have a useful life of four years or more, are acquired by purchase
  as defined in section one  hundred  seventy-nine  (d)  of  the  internal
  revenue  code, have a situs in this state and are used or are to be used
  for  purposes  of  research  and  development  in  the  experimental  or
  laboratory  sense.  Such  purposes  shall  not  be deemed to include the
  ordinary testing or inspection of  materials  or  products  for  quality
  control,  efficiency  surveys,  management  studies,  consumer  surveys,
  advertising,  promotions,  or  research  in  connection  with  literary,
  historical or similar projects.
    (3)  A  taxpayer  shall  not be allowed a credit under this subsection
  with respect to any property described in paragraphs one and two of this
  subsection, if such property  qualifies  for  the  modification  allowed
  under  either  paragraph  three  or  paragraph four of subsection (g) of
  section six hundred twelve whether or not such amount  shall  have  been
  subtracted,  or  if a credit is taken pursuant to subsection (a) of this
  section. Provided, however, with respect  to  property  which  qualifies
  under  either clause (A), (B) or (C) of paragraph four of subsection (g)
  because such property was ordered on or  before  December  thirty-first,
  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight, but with respect to which no expenditure
  has been paid or incurred at  such  date,  the  taxpayer  may  elect  to
  subtract  the  amount allowable under clause (A), (B) or (C) or may take
  the credit provided by this subsection, but not both.


   (4) A taxpayer shall not be allowed a  credit  under  this  subsection
  with  respect to tangible personal property and other tangible property,
  including buildings and structural components  of  buildings,  which  it
  leases to any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding
  sentence, any contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to
  use  such  property  shall  be considered a lease. Provided, however, in
  determining whether a taxpayer shall be  allowed  a  credit  under  this
  subsection with respect to such property, any election made with respect
  to  such  property  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of paragraph eight of
  subsection (f) of  section  one  hundred  sixty-eight  of  the  internal
  revenue  code,  as  such  paragraph was in effect for agreements entered
  into prior to January first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-four,  shall  be
  disregarded.
    (5)  If  the  amount of credit allowable under this subsection for any
  taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year,  the  excess
  may  be  carried over to the following year or years and may be deducted
  from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years but  in  no  event  shall
  such  credit  be  carried  over  to taxable years commencing on or after
  January first, nineteen hundred ninety-four.
    (6) (A) With respect to property  which  is  depreciable  pursuant  to
  section  one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code but is not
  subject to the provisions of section one  hundred  sixty-eight  of  such
  code, and which is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to
  the  end  of  the  taxable  year in which the credit is to be taken, the
  amount of the credit shall be that portion of the credit provided for in
  this subsection which represents the ratio which the months of qualified
  use bear to the months of useful life. If property on which  credit  has
  been  taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to the
  end of its useful life, the difference between the credit taken and  the
  credit  allowed  for  actual  use  must  be  added  back  in the year of
  disposition. Provided, however, if  such  property  is  disposed  of  or
  ceases  to  be  in  qualified use after it has been in qualified use for
  more than twelve consecutive years, it shall not  be  necessary  to  add
  back  the  credit as provided in this subparagraph. The amount of credit
  allowed for actual use shall be determined by multiplying  the  original
  credit by the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to the months
  of  useful  life.  For  purposes  of  this  subparagraph, useful life of
  property shall be  the  same  as  the  taxpayer  uses  for  depreciation
  purposes when computing his federal income tax liability.
    (B)  Except with respect to that property to which subparagraph (D) of
  this paragraph applies, with respect to three-year property, as  defined
  in  subsection  (e)  of  section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal
  revenue code, which is disposed of or ceases  to  be  in  qualified  use
  prior to the end of the taxable year in which the credit is to be taken,
  the  amount  of  the credit shall be that portion of the credit provided
  for in this subsection which represents the ratio which  the  months  of
  qualified  use  bear to thirty-six. If property on which credit has been
  taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to  the  end
  of  thirty-six  months,  the difference between the credit taken and the
  credit allowed for actual  use  must  be  added  back  in  the  year  of
  disposition.  The  amount  of  credit  allowed  for  actual use shall be
  determined by multiplying the original credit by  the  ratio  which  the
  months of qualified use bear to thirty-six.
    (C)  Except with respect to that property to which subparagraph (D) of
  this  paragraph  applies,  with  respect  to  property  subject  to  the
  provisions  of  section  one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue
  code other than three-year property as defined in subsection (e) of such
  section one hundred sixty-eight, which is disposed of or ceases to be in


 qualified use prior to the end of the taxable year in which  the  credit
  is  to  be  taken, the amount of the credit shall be that portion of the
  credit provided for in this subsection which represents the ratio  which
  the  months  of qualified use bear to sixty. If property on which credit
  has been taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior  to
  the end of sixty months, the difference between the credit taken and the
  credit  allowed  for  actual  use  must  be  added  back  in the year of
  disposition. The amount of  credit  allowed  for  actual  use  shall  be
  determined  by  multiplying  the  original credit by the ratio which the
  months of qualified use bear to sixty.
    (D) With  respect  to  any  property  to  which  section  one  hundred
  sixty-eight of the internal revenue code applies, which is a building or
  a  structural component of a building and which is disposed of or ceases
  to be in qualified use prior to the end of the taxable year in which the
  credit is to be taken, the amount of the credit shall be that portion of
  the credit provided for in this subsection which  represents  the  ratio
  which  the  months  of  qualified use bear to the total number of months
  over which the  taxpayer  chooses  to  deduct  the  property  under  the
  internal  revenue  code.  If  property on which credit has been taken is
  disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to  the  end  of  the
  period  over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the property under the
  internal revenue code, the difference between the credit taken  and  the
  credit  allowed  for  actual  use  must  be  added  back  in the year of
  disposition. Provided, however, if  such  property  is  disposed  of  or
  ceases  to  be  in  qualified use after it has been in qualified use for
  more than twelve consecutive years, it shall not  be  necessary  to  add
  back  the  credit as provided in this subparagraph. The amount of credit
  allowed for actual use shall be determined by multiplying  the  original
  credit  by the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to the total
  number of months over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the  property
  under the internal revenue code.
    (i) S corporation credits.

  shareholder's  tax for such year or years, except that any excess credit
  attributable to subdivision one of section two  hundred  ten-B  of  this

  next following the taxable year of origin.

  paragraph  (f) of subdivision three of section two hundred ten-B of this
  chapter shall be attributed in pro rata shares to the  shareholders  who
  were allowed credit under this subsection with respect to such property,
  and  the reduction of a shareholder's proportionate stock interest shall

  by  an  S  corporation in a taxable year of the corporation beginning in
  nineteen hundred ninety-three, which year ends within the  shareholder's
  taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred ninety-four. Any such credit,
  and   carryover  thereof,  shall  be  allowed  as  provided  under  this
  subsection as it was  in  effect  for  taxable  years  beginning  before
  nineteen hundred ninety-four.
    (j)  Empire  zone investment tax credit (EZ-ITC). (1) A taxpayer shall
  be allowed a credit, to be computed as hereinafter provided, against the


 tax imposed by this  article  where  the  taxpayer  has  been  certified
  pursuant  to article eighteen-B of the general municipal law. The amount
  of such credit shall be eight percent of the cost  or  other  basis  for
  federal  income  tax  purposes  of  tangible personal property and other
  tangible property, including  buildings  and  structural  components  of
  buildings,  described  in  paragraph  two  of  this subsection, which is
  located within an empire zone designated as  such  pursuant  to  article
  eighteen-B  of  such  law,  but  only  if the acquisition, construction,
  reconstruction or erection of such property occurred or was commenced on
  or after the date of  such  designation  and  prior  to  the  expiration
  thereof.  Provided,  however,  that  in  the  case  of  an  acquisition,
  construction, reconstruction or erection which was commenced during such
  period and continued or completed  subsequently,  the  credit  shall  be
  eight  percent  of  the  portion  of the cost or other basis for federal
  income tax purposes attributable to such period, which portion shall  be
  ascertained  by  multiplying  such  cost  or  basis  by  a  fraction the
  numerator of which shall be the expenditures  paid  or  incurred  during
  such  period for such purposes and the denominator of which shall be the
  total of  all  expenditures  paid  or  incurred  for  such  acquisition,
  construction, reconstruction or erection.
    (2)  A  credit  shall be allowed under this subsection with respect to
  tangible  personal  property  and  other  tangible  property,  including
  buildings   and  structural  components  of  buildings  which:  (A)  are
  depreciable pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the  internal
  revenue  code,  (B)  have  a  useful life of four years or more, (C) are
  acquired by purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine  (d)
  of  the  internal  revenue  code,  (D)  have  a  situs in an empire zone
  designated as  such  pursuant  to  article  eighteen-B  of  the  general
  municipal  law,  and (E) are (i) principally used by the taxpayer in the
  production of goods by manufacturing, processing, assembling,  refining,
  mining,  extracting,  farming,  agriculture, horticulture, floriculture,
  viticulture or  commercial  fishing,  (ii)  industrial  waste  treatment
  facilities  or  air  pollution control facilities used in the taxpayer's
  trade  or  business,  (iii)  research  and  development  property,  (iv)
  principally  used  in  the  ordinary  course  of the taxpayer's trade or
  business as a broker or dealer in connection with the purchase  or  sale
  (which  shall include but not be limited to the issuance, entering into,
  assumption, offset, assignment, termination,  or  transfer)  of  stocks,
  bonds   or   other   securities  as  defined  in  section  four  hundred
  seventy-five (c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, or of  commodities  as
  defined in section four hundred seventy-five (e) of the Internal Revenue
  Code,  or  (v) principally used in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's
  trade or business  of  providing  investment  advisory  services  for  a
  regulated  investment  company  as  defined  in  section  eight  hundred
  fifty-one of the Internal Revenue Code, or lending, loan arrangement  or
  loan  origination  services to customers in connection with the purchase
  or sale (which shall  include  but  not  be  limited  to  the  issuance,
  entering into, assumption, offset, assignment, termination, or transfer)
  of  securities as defined in section four hundred seventy-five (c)(2) of
  the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of clauses (iv) and (v) of  this
  subparagraph,  property  purchased  by  a  taxpayer  affiliated  with  a
  regulated broker, dealer or registered investment adviser is  allowed  a
  credit  under  this subsection if the property is used by its affiliated
  regulated broker, dealer or registered investment adviser in  accordance
  with  this  subsection.  For  purposes of determining if the property is
  principally used in qualifying uses, the uses by the taxpayer  described
  in  clauses  (iv)  and  (v)  of  this subparagraph may be aggregated. In
  addition, the uses by the taxpayer,  its  affiliated  regulated  broker,


 dealer,  and registered investment adviser under either or both of those
  clauses may be aggregated. Provided, however, a taxpayer  shall  not  be
  allowed the credit provided by clauses (iv) and (v) of this subparagraph
  unless  (I)  eighty  percent  or  more  of  the employees performing the
  administrative and support functions resulting from or  related  to  the
  qualifying uses of such equipment are located in this state, or (II) the
  average  number of employees that perform the administrative and support
  functions resulting from or related  to  the  qualifying  uses  of  such
  equipment  and  are  located  in  this state during the taxable year for
  which the credit is claimed is equal  to  or  greater  than  ninety-five
  percent  of the average number of employees that perform these functions
  and are located in this state during the thirty-six  months  immediately
  preceding  the year for which the credit is claimed, or (III) the number
  of employees located in this state during the taxable year for which the
  credit is claimed is equal to or greater  than  ninety  percent  of  the
  number  of  employees  located  in  this state on December thirty-first,
  nineteen hundred ninety-eight or, if the taxpayer  was  not  a  calendar
  year  taxpayer  in  nineteen  hundred  ninety-eight, the last day of its
  first taxable year ending after December thirty-first, nineteen  hundred
  ninety-eight. If the taxpayer becomes subject to tax in this state after
  the  taxable  year  beginning in nineteen hundred ninety-eight, then the
  taxpayer is not required to satisfy the employment test provided in  the
  preceding  sentence of this subparagraph for its first taxable year. For
  purposes of clause (III) of this subparagraph, the employment test  will
  be  based  on  the number of employees located in this state on the last
  day of the first taxable year the taxpayer is subject  to  tax  in  this
  state.  If  the  uses  of  the  property must be aggregated to determine
  whether the property is principally used in qualifying uses, then either
  each affiliate using the property must satisfy this employment  test  or
  this  employment  test  must be satisfied through the aggregation of the
  employees of the taxpayer, its affiliated regulated broker, dealer,  and
  registered  investment  adviser using the property. For purposes of this
  subsection, the term "goods" shall not include electricity. For purposes
  of this paragraph, manufacturing shall mean the process of  working  raw
  materials  into  wares  suitable  for use or which gives new shapes, new
  quality or new combination to matter which already has gone through some
  artificial process by the use of machinery, tools, appliances and  other
  similar  equipment.  Property  used  in  the  production  of goods shall
  include  machinery,  equipment  or  other  tangible  property  which  is
  principally used in the repair and service of other machinery, equipment
  or  other  tangible property used principally in the production of goods
  and shall include all  facilities  used  in  the  production  operation,
  including  storage  of  material  to  be  used  in production and of the
  products that are produced. For purposes of this  paragraph,  the  terms
  "research   and   development  property",  "industrial  waste  treatment
  facilities", and "air  pollution  control  facilities"  shall  have  the
  meanings ascribed thereto by clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), respectively,
  of  subparagraph (B) of paragraph two of subsection (a) of this section,
  and the provisions of subparagraph  (C)  of  such  paragraph  two  shall
  apply.
    (3)  A  taxpayer  shall  not be allowed a credit under this subsection
  with respect to  any  tangible  personal  property  and  other  tangible
  property,  including  buildings  and structural components of buildings,
  which it leases to any  other  person  or  corporation  except  where  a
  taxpayer  leases  property to an affiliated regulated broker, dealer, or
  registered investment adviser that uses such property in accordance with
  clause (iv) or  (v)  of  subparagraph  (E)  of  paragraph  two  of  this
  subsection.  For  purposes  of  the  preceding sentence, any contract or


 agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use such  property  shall
  be  considered  a  lease.  Provided,  however,  in determining whether a
  taxpayer shall be allowed a credit under this subsection with respect to
  such  property, any election made with respect to such property pursuant
  to the provisions of paragraph eight of subsection (f)  of  section  one
  hundred  sixty-eight of the internal revenue code, as such paragraph was
  in effect for agreements entered into prior to January  first,  nineteen
  hundred eighty-four, shall be disregarded.
    (4)  If  the  amount  of  credit allowed under this subsection for any
  taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year,  the  excess
  may  be  carried over to the following year or years and may be deducted
  from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years. In lieu of carrying over
  any such excess, a taxpayer who qualifies as an owner of a new  business
  for  purposes of paragraph ten of subsection (a) of this section may, at
  his option, receive fifty percent of such excess as a refund. Any refund
  paid pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to be  a  refund  of  an
  overpayment of tax as provided in section six hundred eighty-six of this
  article, provided, however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.
    (4-a)  Any carry over of a credit from prior taxable years will not be
  allowed if an empire zone retention certificate is not  issued  pursuant
  to  subdivision  (w)  of  section nine hundred fifty-nine of the general
  municipal law to the empire zone enterprise which is the  basis  of  the
  credit.
    (5)  At  the  option  of  the taxpayer, air or water pollution control
  facilities which qualify for elective modifications under subsection (h)
  of section six hundred twelve, or research  and  development  facilities
  which  qualify for elective modification under paragraphs three and four
  of subsection (g) of section  six  hundred  twelve,  or  property  which
  qualifies  for  the  credit provided under subsection (a) or (h) of this
  section may be treated as property principally used by the  taxpayer  in
  the  production  of  goods  by  manufacturing,  processing,  assembling,
  mining,  refining,  extracting,  farming,   agriculture,   horticulture,
  floriculture,  viticulture, or commercial fishing, provided the property
  otherwise qualifies under paragraph two of  this  subsection,  in  which
  event a deduction shall not be allowed under such subsection (h) or such
  paragraphs  three  and  four of subsection (g) and a credit shall not be
  allowed under such subsection (a) or (h).
    (6) (A) With respect to property  which  is  depreciable  pursuant  to
  section  one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code but is not
  subject to the provisions of section one  hundred  sixty-eight  of  such
  code  and which is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to
  the end of the taxable year in which the credit  is  to  be  taken,  the
  amount of the credit shall be that portion of the credit provided for in
  this  section  which  represents the ratio which the months of qualified
  use bear to the months of useful life. If the property on  which  credit
  has  been taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to
  the end of its useful life, the difference between the credit taken  and
  the  credit  allowed  for  actual  use must be added back in the year of
  disposition. Provided, however, if  such  property  is  disposed  of  or
  ceases  to  be  in  qualified use after it has been in qualified use for
  more than twelve consecutive years, it shall not  be  necessary  to  add
  back  the  credit  as  provided in this subsection. The amount of credit
  allowed for actual use shall be determined by multiplying  the  original
  credit by the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to the months
  of useful life. For purposes of this subsection, useful life of property
  shall  be  the  same as the taxpayer uses for depreciation purposes when
  computing his federal income tax liability.


   (B) Except with respect to that property to which subparagraph (D)  of
  this  paragraph applies, with respect to three-year property, as defined
  in subsection (e) of section one hundred  sixty-eight  of  the  internal
  revenue  code,  which  is  disposed  of or ceases to be in qualified use
  prior to the end of the taxable year in which the credit is to be taken,
  the  amount  of  the credit shall be that portion of the credit provided
  for in this subsection which represents the ratio which  the  months  of
  qualified  use  bear to thirty-six. If property on which credit has been
  taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to  the  end
  of  thirty-six  months,  the difference between the credit taken and the
  credit allowed for actual  use  must  be  added  back  in  the  year  of
  disposition.  The  amount  of  credit  allowed  for  actual use shall be
  determined by multiplying the original credit by  the  ratio  which  the
  months of qualified use bear to thirty-six.
    (C)  Except with respect to that property to which subparagraph (D) of
  this  paragraph  applies,  with  respect  to  property  subject  to  the
  provisions  of  section  one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue
  code other than three-year property as defined in subsection (e) of such
  section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue  code  which  is
  disposed  of  or  ceases  to be in qualified use prior to the end of the
  taxable year in which the credit is to  be  taken,  the  amount  of  the
  credit  shall  be  that  portion  of  the  credit  provided  for in this
  subsection which represents the ratio which the months of qualified  use
  bear to sixty. If property on which credit has been taken is disposed of
  or  ceases  to be in qualified use prior to the end of sixty months, the
  difference between the credit taken and the credit  allowed  for  actual
  use  must be added back in the year of disposition. The amount of credit
  allowed for actual use shall be determined by multiplying  the  original
  credit by the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to sixty.
    (D)  With  respect  to  any  property  to  which  section  one hundred
  sixty-eight of the internal revenue code applies, which is a building or
  a structural component of a building and which is disposed of or  ceases
  to be in qualified use prior to the end of the taxable year in which the
  credit is to be taken, the amount of the credit shall be that portion of
  the  credit  provided  for in this subsection which represents the ratio
  which the months of qualified use bear to the  total  number  of  months
  over  which  the  taxpayer  chooses  to  deduct  the  property under the
  internal revenue code. If property on which credit  has  been  taken  is
  disposed  of  or  ceases  to be in qualified use prior to the end of the
  period over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the property under  the
  internal  revenue  code, the difference between the credit taken and the
  credit allowed for actual  use  must  be  added  back  in  the  year  of
  disposition.  Provided,  however,  if  such  property  is disposed of or
  ceases to be in qualified use after it has been  in  qualified  use  for
  more  than  twelve  consecutive  years, it shall not be necessary to add
  back the credit as provided in this subparagraph. The amount  of  credit
  allowed  for  actual use shall be determined by multiplying the original
  credit by the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to the  total
  number  of months over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the property
  under the internal revenue code.
    (E) For purposes of this paragraph, disposal or cessation of qualified
  use shall not be deemed  to  have  occurred  solely  by  reason  of  the
  termination or expiration of an empire zone's designation as such.
    (F)(i)  For  purposes  of  this  paragraph,  the  decertification of a
  business enterprise with respect to an empire zone  shall  constitute  a
  disposal  or  cessation  of  qualified  use of the property on which the
  credit  was  taken  which  is  located  in  the  zone   to   which   the
  decertification applies, on the effective date of such decertification.


   (ii)  Where  a  business  enterprise  has  been decertified based on a
  finding pursuant to clause one, two,  or  five  of  subdivision  (a)  of
  section nine hundred fifty-nine of the general municipal law, the amount
  required to be added back by reason of this paragraph shall be augmented
  by  an amount equal to the product of the amount of credit, with respect
  to property which is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use, which
  was deducted from the taxpayer's tax otherwise due  under  this  article
  for  all  prior  taxable  years  (subject to the limit set forth in this
  subparagraph) and the underpayment rate of interest (without  regard  to
  compounding) set by the commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to
  subdivision  (j) of section six hundred ninety-seven of this chapter, in
  effect on the last day of the taxable year. The limit shall be  (I)  the
  amount  of  credit, with respect to the property which is disposed of or
  ceases to be in qualified use, which was deducted  from  the  taxpayer's
  tax  otherwise  due  under  this  article  for  all prior taxable years,
  reduced (but not below zero) by (II) the credit allowed for actual  use.
  For  purposes of this subparagraph, the attribution to specific property
  of credit amount deducted from tax shall be  established  in  accordance
  with  the  date  of  placement in service of such property in the empire
  zone.
    (iii) In no event shall the amount of the credit allowed  pursuant  to
  this  subsection  be  rendered,  solely  by reason of clause (i) of this
  subparagraph, less than the amount of the credit to which  the  taxpayer
  would otherwise be entitled under subsection (a) of this section.
    (iv)  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of this subsection, in the
  case of a business enterprise which has been decertified, any amount  of
  credit  allowed with respect to the property of such business enterprise
  located in the zone  to  which  the  decertification  applies  which  is
  carried  over pursuant to paragraph four of this subsection shall not be
  carried over beyond the seventh taxable year next following the  taxable
  year  with  respect  to which the credit provided for in this subsection
  was allowed.
    (G) For purposes of this paragraph, where a  credit  is  allowed  with
  respect  to  an  air  pollution  control  facility  on  the  basis  of a
  certificate  of  compliance  issued  pursuant   to   the   environmental
  conservation  law and the certificate is revoked pursuant to subdivision
  three of section 19-0309 of the  environmental  conservation  law,  such
  revocation  shall  constitute  a disposal or cessation of qualified use,
  except with respect to property contained in or comprising such facility
  which is described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph  (E)  of
  paragraph  two of this subsection other than as part of or comprising an
  air pollution control facility. Also for purposes of this paragraph, the
  use of  an  air  pollution  control  facility  or  an  industrial  waste
  treatment  facility for the primary purpose of salvaging materials which
  are  usable  in  the  manufacturing  process  or  are  marketable  shall
  constitute a cessation of qualified use, except with respect to property
  contained  in  or  comprising such facility which is described in clause
  (i) or (iii) of subparagraph (E) of paragraph two of this subsection.
    (H) Except as provided in this subparagraph, this paragraph shall  not
  apply  to  a  credit  allowed by this subsection to a taxpayer that is a
  partner  in  a  partnership  in  the  case  of  manufacturing  property;
  provided,  at  the  time  such  property  was  placed in service by such
  partnership in an empire zone the basis for federal income tax  purposes
  of  such  property (or a project that includes such property) equaled or
  exceeded three hundred million dollars and such partner owned his or her
  partnership interest for  at  least  three  years  from  the  date  such
  property  was  placed  in  service.  If  such  property  ceases to be in
  qualified use after it is placed in service, this paragraph shall  apply


 to  such  partner  in  the year such property ceases to be in qualifying
  use.
    (7)  Notwithstanding  the expiration of the empire zones program under
  article eighteen-B of the general municipal  law,  a  taxpayer  that  is
  certified as an empire zone business pursuant to such article eighteen-B
  on  the  day  immediately  preceding  the  day  the empire zones program
  expired shall  continue  to  be  deemed  certified  under  such  article
  eighteen-B  for  purposes  of  this  subdivision  until April first, two
  thousand fourteen. In addition, the areas designated as empire zones  in
  which  the  taxpayer  is certified as an empire zone business on the day
  immediately preceding the day the empire  zones  program  expired  shall
  continue  to  be  deemed  empire  zones for purposes of this subdivision
  until April first, two thousand fourteen.
    (j-1) Empire zone employment incentive credit. (1) Where a taxpayer is
  allowed a credit under subsection (j)  of  this  section,  the  taxpayer
  shall  be  allowed  a credit for each of the three years next succeeding
  the taxable year for which the  credit  under  such  subsection  (j)  is
  allowed,  with  respect  to  such property, whether or not deductible in
  such taxable year or in subsequent taxable years pursuant  to  paragraph
  four  of subsection (j) of this section, of thirty percent of the credit
  allowable under such subsection (j); provided, however, that the  credit
  allowable  under  this  subsection  for  any  taxable year shall only be
  allowed if the average number of employees employed by the  taxpayer  in
  the  empire  zone,  designated  pursuant  to  article  eighteen-B of the
  general municipal law, in which such property  is  located  during  such
  taxable  year  is at least one hundred one percent of the average number
  of employees employed by the taxpayer in  such  empire  zone  or,  where
  applicable,  in the geographic area subsequently constituting such zone,
  during the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year for which
  the credit under such subsection (j) is allowed and  provided,  further,
  that  in  the  case  of  a new business, the credit allowable under this
  subsection for any taxable year shall be allowed if the  average  number
  of  employees  employed  in  such empire zone in such taxable year is at
  least one hundred one percent of the average number  of  such  employees
  during the taxable year in which the credit under such subsection (j) is
  allowed.
    (2)  The  average  number of employees employed in an empire zone, or,
  where applicable, in the geographic area subsequently constituting  such
  zone,  in a taxable year shall be computed by ascertaining the number of
  such employees within such zone, or, where applicable, in the geographic
  area subsequently constituting such zone, employed by  the  taxpayer  on
  the  thirty-first day of March, the thirtieth day of June, the thirtieth
  day of September and the thirty-first day of  December  in  the  taxable
  year,  by adding together the number of employees ascertained in each of
  such dates and dividing the sum  so  obtained  by  the  number  of  such
  abovementioned dates occurring within the taxable year.
    (3)  If  the  amount  of  credit allowed under this subsection for any
  taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year,  the  excess
  may  be  carried over to the following year or years and may be deducted
  from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years. In lieu of carrying over
  any such excess, a taxpayer who qualified as an owner of a new  business
  for  purposes of paragraph ten of subsection (a) of this section may, at
  his option, receive fifty percent of such excess as a refund. Any refund
  paid pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to be  a  refund  of  an
  overpayment of tax as provided in section six hundred eighty-six of this
  article, provided, however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.
    (3-a)  Any carry over of a credit from prior taxable years will not be
  allowed to an empire zone enterprise which is the basis of  the  credit,


 if  an  empire  zone  retention certificate is not issued to such entity
  pursuant to subdivision (w) of section nine hundred  fifty-nine  of  the
  general municipal law.
    (4)  Notwithstanding  the expiration of the empire zones program under
  article eighteen-B of the general municipal  law,  a  taxpayer  that  is
  certified as an empire zone business pursuant to such article eighteen-B
  on  the  day  immediately  preceding  the  day  the empire zones program
  expired shall continue to be deemed in the  empire  zone  in  which  the
  taxpayer was certified as an empire zone business on the day immediately
  preceding the day the empire zones program expired for each of the three
  years  next  succeeding  the  taxable  year  for  which the credit under
  subdivision (j) is allowed.
    (k) Empire zone wage tax credit. (1) A taxpayer  shall  be  allowed  a
  credit,  to be computed as hereinafter provided, against the tax imposed
  by this article, where the  taxpayer  has  been  certified  pursuant  to
  article  eighteen-B  of  the  general  municipal law. The amount of such
  credit shall be as prescribed in paragraph four of this subsection.
    (2) For the purposes of this subsection,  the  following  terms  shall
  have the following meanings: (A) "Empire zone wages" means wages paid by
  the  taxpayer  for  full-time  employment during the taxable year, in an
  area designated or previously designated  as  an  empire  zone  or  zone
  equivalent  area pursuant to article eighteen-B of the general municipal
  law, where such employment is in a job created in the  area  (i)  during
  the  period of its designation as an empire zone, (ii) within four years
  of the expiration of such designation, or  (iii)  during  the  ten  year
  period   immediately  following  the  date  of  designation  as  a  zone
  equivalent area, provided, however, that if the taxpayer's certification
  under article eighteen-B of the general municipal law  is  revoked  with
  respect to an empire zone or zone equivalent area, any wages paid by the
  taxpayer,  on  or  after the effective date of such decertification, for
  employment in such zone shall not constitute empire zone wages.
    (B) "Targeted employee" means a New York resident who receives  empire
  zone wages and who is (i) an eligible individual under the provisions of
  the  targeted jobs tax credit (section fifty-one of the internal revenue
  code), (ii) eligible for benefits under the provisions of the  workforce
  investment  act  as  a  dislocated worker or low-income individual (P.L.
  105-220, as amended), (iii) a recipient of public  assistance  benefits,
  (iv)  an  individual whose income is below the most recently established
  poverty rate promulgated by the United States department of commerce, or
  a member of a family whose family income  is  below  the  most  recently
  established  poverty  rate promulgated by the appropriate federal agency
  or (v) an honorably discharged member of any branch of the armed  forces
  of the United States.
    An  individual  who  satisfies  the  criteria set forth in clause (i),
  (ii), (iv) or (v) at the time of initial  employment  in  the  job  with
  respect  to  which the credit is claimed, or who satisfies the criterion
  set forth in clause (iii) at  such  time  or  at  any  time  within  the
  previous  two  years,  shall  be  a  targeted  employee  so long as such
  individual continues to receive empire zone wages.
    (C) "Average  number  of  individuals  employed  full-time"  shall  be
  computed  by ascertaining the number of such individuals employed by the
  taxpayer on the thirty-first day of March, the thirtieth  day  of  June,
  the  thirtieth  day  of  September  and the thirty-first day of December
  during each taxable year or other applicable period, by adding  together
  the  number  of  such  individuals ascertained on each of such dates and
  dividing the sum so obtained by  the  number  of  such  dates  occurring
  within such taxable year or other applicable period.


   (3)  The  credit  provided  for herein shall be allowed only where the
  average number of individuals employed full-time by the taxpayer in  (i)
  the  state and (ii) the empire zone or area previously constituting such
  zone or zone equivalent  area,  during  the  taxable  year  exceeds  the
  average number of such individuals employed full-time by the taxpayer in
  (i)  the  state  and  (ii)  such zone or area subsequently or previously
  constituting such zone  or  such  zone  equivalent  area,  respectively,
  during  the  four  years immediately preceding the first taxable year in
  which the credit is claimed with respect to such zone or area. Where the
  taxpayer provided full-time employment within (i) the state or (ii) such
  zone or area during only a portion of such four-year  period,  then  for
  purposes  of  this  paragraph  the  term "four years" shall be deemed to
  refer instead to such portion, if any.
    The credit shall be allowed only with respect  to  the  first  taxable
  year  during  which  payments  of  empire  zone  wages  are made and the
  conditions set forth in this paragraph are satisfied, and  with  respect
  to each of the four taxable years next following (but only, with respect
  to  each of such years, if such conditions are satisfied), in accordance
  with paragraph four of this subsection. Subsequent certifications of the
  taxpayer pursuant to article eighteen-B of the general municipal law, at
  the same or a different  location  in  the  same  empire  zone  or  zone
  equivalent  area  or  at  a  location in a different empire zone or zone
  equivalent area, shall not extend the five taxable year time  limitation
  on  the  allowance  of  the  credit set forth in the preceding sentence.
  Provided, further, however, that no credit shall be allowed with respect
  to any taxable year beginning more than four years following the taxable
  year in which designation as an empire zone expired  or  more  than  ten
  years after the designation as a zone equivalent area.
    (4) The amount of the credit shall equal the sum of
    (i)  the  product  of three thousand dollars and the average number of
  individuals employed full-time by the taxpayer, computed pursuant to the
  provisions of subparagraph (C) of paragraph two of this subsection, who
    (I) received empire zone wages for more than half of the taxable year,
    (II) received with  respect  to  more  than  half  of  the  period  of
  employment by the taxpayer during the taxable year, an hourly wage which
  was  at  least  one  hundred  thirty-five  percent  of  the minimum wage
  specified in section six hundred fifty-two of the labor law, and
    (III) are targeted employees; and
    (ii) the product of fifteen hundred dollars and the average number  of
  individuals (excluding individuals described in subparagraph (i) of this
  paragraph)  employed full-time by the taxpayer, computed pursuant to the
  provisions of subparagraph (C) of paragraph two of this subsection,  who
  received empire zone wages for more than half of the taxable year.
    Provided,  further,  however, that the credit provided for herein with
  respect to the taxable year,  and  carryovers  of  such  credit  to  the
  taxable  year,  deducted  from  the  tax  otherwise due, may not, in the
  aggregate, exceed fifty percent of the tax  imposed  under  section  six
  hundred  one  computed  without  regard to any credit provided for under
  this article.
    (iii)  For  purposes  of  calculating  the  amount  of   the   credit,
  individuals  employed  within  an  empire  zone  or zone equivalent area
  within the immediately preceding sixty months by a  related  person,  as
  such  term  is  defined  in  subparagraph  (c)  of  paragraph  three  of
  subsection (b) of  section  four  hundred  sixty-five  of  the  internal
  revenue code, shall not be included in the average number of individuals
  described  in  subparagraph  (i) or subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph,
  unless such related  person  was  never  allowed  a  credit  under  this
  subsection  with  respect  to  such  employees.  For  purposes  of  this


 subparagraph, a "related person" shall include  an  entity  which  would
  have  qualified as a "related person" to the taxpayer if it had not been
  dissolved, liquidated, merged with another entity or otherwise ceased to
  exist or operate.
    (iv)  If  a  taxpayer  is certified in an empire zone designated under
  subdivision (a) or (d)  of  section  nine  hundred  fifty-eight  of  the
  general  municipal  law, the dollar amounts specified under subparagraph
  (i) or (ii) of this paragraph shall be increased by five hundred dollars
  for each qualifying individual under  such  subparagraph  who  received,
  during the taxable year, wages in excess of forty thousand dollars.
    (v)  The  requirement  in this paragraph that an employee must receive
  empire zone wages for more than half the taxable year shall not apply in
  the first taxable year of a taxpayer satisfying the criteria  set  forth
  in  this  subparagraph.  In  such  a case, the credit allowed under this
  subsection shall be computed by  utilizing  the  number  of  individuals
  (excluding  general  executive  officers)  employed  full  time  by  the
  taxpayer on the last day of its first taxable  year.  A  taxpayer  shall
  satisfy  the  following  criteria:  (I)  such  taxpayer acquired real or
  tangible personal property during its first taxable year from an  entity
  which  is  not  a related person (as such term is defined in subdivision
  (g) of section fourteen of this chapter); (II) the first taxable year of
  such taxpayer shall be a short taxable  year  of  not  more  than  seven
  months  in  duration;  and  (III)  the  number  of  individuals employed
  full-time on the last day of such first taxable year shall be  at  least
  one  hundred  ninety and substantially all of such individuals must have
  been previously employed by the entity from whom such taxpayer purchased
  its assets.
    (5) If the amount of the credit and carryovers of such credit  allowed
  under  this  subsection for any taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's
  tax for such year, the excess, as well as any  part  of  the  credit  or
  carryovers  of  such credit, or both, which may not be deducted from the
  tax otherwise due by reason of the  final  sentence  in  paragraph  four
  hereof,  may  be  carried over to the following year or years and may be
  deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year  or  years.  In  lieu  of
  carrying over any such excess, a taxpayer who qualifies as an owner of a
  new  business  for  purposes  of paragraph ten of subsection (a) of this
  section may, at his option, receive fifty percent of such  excess  as  a
  refund. Any refund paid pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to be
  a  refund  of  an  overpayment of tax as provided in section six hundred
  eighty-six of this article, provided, however, that no interest shall be
  paid thereon.
    (5-a) Any carry over of a credit from prior taxable years will not  be
  allowed  if  an empire zone retention certificate is not issued pursuant
  to subdivision (w) of section nine hundred  fifty-nine  of  the  general
  municipal  law  to  the empire zone enterprise which is the basis of the
  credit.
    (l) Empire zone capital tax credit.  (1) A taxpayer shall be allowed a
  credit against the tax imposed by this article. The amount of the credit
  shall be equal to twenty-five  percent  of  the  sum  of  the  following
  investments and contributions made during the taxable year and certified
  by  the  commissioner  of  economic  development:  (A) for taxable years
  beginning before January first, two thousand five, qualified investments
  made in, or contributions in the form of donations made to, one or  more
  empire  zone  capital  corporations established pursuant to section nine
  hundred sixty-four of the general municipal law prior to January  first,
  two   thousand   five,  (B)  qualified  investments  in  certified  zone
  businesses which during the twelve month  period  immediately  preceding
  the month in which such investment is made employed full-time within the


 state  an  average  number of individuals of two hundred fifty or fewer,
  computed pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (C) of paragraph two
  of subsection (k) of this section, except for investments made by or  on
  behalf  of  an  owner  of  the business including, but not limited to, a
  stockholder, partner or sole  proprietor,  or  any  related  person,  as
  defined  in  subparagraph  (C)  of  paragraph three of subsection (b) of
  section four hundred sixty-five of the internal revenue  code,  and  (C)
  contributions  of  money to community development projects as defined in
  regulations promulgated by the  commissioner  of  economic  development.
  "Qualified   investments"  means  the  contribution  of  property  to  a
  corporation in exchange  for  original  issue  capital  stock  or  other
  ownership  interest,  the  contribution  of property to a partnership in
  exchange for an interest in the partnership, and  similar  contributions
  in the case of a business entity not in corporate or partnership form in
  exchange  for  an ownership interest in such entity. The total amount of
  credit allowable to a taxpayer under this provision for all years, taken
  in the aggregate, shall not exceed three hundred thousand  dollars,  and
  shall  not  exceed  one  hundred  thousand  dollars  with respect to the
  investments and contributions described in each  of  subparagraphs  (A),
  (B) and (C) of this paragraph.
    (1-a)  Any carry over of a credit from prior taxable years will not be
  allowed to an empire zone enterprise which is the basis of  the  credit,
  if  an  empire  zone  retention certificate is not issued to such entity
  pursuant to subdivision (w) of section nine hundred  fifty-nine  of  the
  general municipal law.
    (2)  (A)  If  the  amount  of the credit and carryovers of such credit
  allowed under this subsection for any  taxable  year  shall  exceed  the
  taxpayer's tax for such year, or if any part of the credit or carryovers
  of  such credit may not be deducted from the tax otherwise due by reason
  of the final sentence of this subparagraph,  any  amount  of  credit  or
  carryovers  of  such credit thus not deductible in such taxable year may
  be carried over to the following year or years and may be deducted  from
  the  tax for such year or years. In addition, the amount of such credit,
  and carryovers of such credit to the taxable year, deducted from the tax
  otherwise due may not, in the aggregate, exceed fifty percent of the tax
  imposed under section six hundred one computed  without  regard  to  any
  credit provided for by this section.
    (B)  In  the  case  of  a  husband  or  wife who is required to file a
  separate return, the limitation provided for in paragraph  one  of  this
  subsection  shall  be  fifty  thousand  dollars  in  lieu of one hundred
  thousand dollars and one hundred fifty thousand dollars in lieu of three
  hundred thousand dollars, unless the  spouse  of  the  taxpayer  has  no
  credit  allowable  under  this  subsection  for the taxable year of such
  spouse which ends within or with the taxpayer's taxable year.
    (C) In the case of an estate or trust, the limitation provided for  in
  paragraph  one  of  this  subsection shall be reduced to an amount which
  bears the same ratio to one hundred thousand dollars and an amount which
  bears the same ratio to three hundred thousand dollars as the portion of
  the  income  of  the  estate  or  trust  which  is  not   allocated   to
  beneficiaries bears to the total income of the estate or trust.
    (3)  Where the stock, partnership interest or other ownership interest
  arising from a qualified investment as described  in  subparagraphs  (A)
  and  (B)  of  paragraph  one  of  this  subsection  is  disposed of, the
  taxpayer's New York  taxable  income  shall  be  computed,  pursuant  to
  regulations  promulgated  by the commissioner, so as to properly reflect
  the reduced cost thereof arising from  the  application  of  the  credit
  provided for herein.


   (4)  (A)  Where  a  taxpayer sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of
  corporate stock, a partnership  interest  or  other  ownership  interest
  arising  from  the making of a qualified investment which was the basis,
  in whole or in part, for the allowance of the credit provided for  under
  this  subsection,  or  where  a contribution or investment which was the
  basis for such allowance  is  in  any  manner,  in  whole  or  in  part,
  recovered  by  such  taxpayer,  and  such disposition or recovery occurs
  during the taxable year or within thirty-six months from  the  close  of
  the  taxable  year  with  respect  to  which  such  credit  is  allowed,
  subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply.
    (B) The taxpayer shall add back with respect to the  taxable  year  in
  which  the disposition or recovery described in subparagraph (A) of this
  paragraph  occurred  the  required  portion  of  the  credit  originally
  allowed.
    (C) The required portion of the credit originally allowed shall be the
  product  of  (i) the portion of such credit attributable to the property
  disposed of or the  payment  or  contribution  recovered  and  (ii)  the
  applicable percentage.
    (D) The applicable percentage shall be:
    (i)  one hundred percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs within
  the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed  or  within
  twelve months of the end of such taxable year,
    (ii)  sixty-seven  percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs more
  than twelve but not more than twenty-four months after the  end  of  the
  taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed, or
    (iii) thirty-three percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs more
  than  twenty-four  but  not more than thirty-six months after the end of
  the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed.
    (5) If the designation of an area as an empire zone is  no  longer  in
  effect  because the designations of all empire zones pursuant to article
  eighteen-B of the general municipal law have expired,  a  taxpayer  that
  has  made  a  contribution  of  money  on  or before the day immediately
  preceding the day the empire zones expired to  a  community  development
  project  approved  by  the commissioner of economic development shall be
  deemed  eligible  to  claim  the  empire  zone  capital   credit   under
  subparagraph  (C)  of  paragraph  one  of this subsection for additional
  contributions made prior to  April  first,  two  thousand  fourteen  and
  certified  by the commissioner of economic development to that community
  development project as payment of a commitment made by the  taxpayer  to
  that community development project before the empire zones expired.
    (m) Excess deductions credit. (1) General. For taxable years beginning
  in  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five, an excess deductions credit shall be
  allowed against the tax determined under subsections (a) through (d)  of
  section  six hundred one of this article. The credit shall be allowed to
  an individual taxpayer whose  New  York  itemized  deduction  determined
  under  section  six  hundred fifteen (whether or not the taxpayer elects
  the New York itemized deduction for the taxable year) exceeds  the  base
  amount  determined  under  paragraph  two  hereof.  The credit shall not
  exceed the tax determined under subsections (a) through (d)  of  section
  six  hundred  one for the taxable year, reduced by the credits permitted
  under subsection (c) of this section and sections six hundred twenty and
  six hundred twenty-one of this article.
    (2) Base amount. The base amount shall be determined by the taxpayer's
  standard deduction status under section six hundred fourteen (whether or
  not the taxpayer employs the standard deduction for the taxable year) as
  follows:


 If the taxpayer's standard                   The base amount is:
      deduction status is:
 
    Unmarried individual who is
    not a head of household nor a
    surviving spouse nor an
    individual whose federal
    exemption amount is zero                         $6,000
 
    Husband and wife whose New York
    taxable income is determined
    jointly, or a surviving spouse                   $9,500
 
    Head of household                                $7,000
 
    Married individual filing a
    separate New York return                         $4,750
 
    (3) Credit amount.
    (A)  Married  individuals  filing joint returns and surviving spouses.
  The amount of the credit allowed pursuant to this subsection for married
  individuals filing jointly under subsection (b) of section  six  hundred
  fifty-one and for a surviving spouse shall be:
 
  If New York taxable income is:           The credit is the following
                                             percentage of New York
                                                 taxable income:
    Not over $11,500                                  0.57%
    Over $11,500 but not over $17,500                 0.51%
    Over $17,500 but not over $24,100                 0.36%
    Over $24,100 but not over $31,500                 0.26%
    Over $31,500 but not over $35,500                 0.16%
    Over $35,500 but not over $42,000                 0.11%

    (n)  Agricultural  property  tax credit. (1) General. In the case of a
  taxpayer who is an eligible farmer or an eligible farmer  who  has  paid
  taxes  pursuant  to a land contract, there shall be allowed a credit for
  the allowable school district property taxes. The term "allowable school
  district property taxes" means the school district property  taxes  paid
  during  the  taxable year on qualified agricultural property, subject to
  the acreage limitation provided in paragraph five of this subsection and
  the income limitation provided in paragraph six of this subsection. Such
  credit shall be allowed against the taxes imposed by  this  article  for
  the  taxable  year  reduced by the credits permitted by this article. If
  the credit exceeds the tax as so reduced, the taxpayer may receive,  and
  the comptroller, subject to a certificate of the commissioner, shall pay
  as an overpayment, without interest, the amount of such excess.
    (2)  Eligible  farmer.  For  purposes  of  this  subsection,  the term
  "eligible farmer" means a  taxpayer  whose  federal  gross  income  from
  farming  for  the  taxable year is at least two-thirds of excess federal
  gross income. The term "eligible farmer"  also  includes  an  individual
  other  than  the  taxpayer of record for qualified agricultural land who
  has paid the school district property taxes on such land pursuant  to  a
  contract  for  the  future  purchase  of  such  land; provided that such
  individual has a federal gross income from farming for the taxable  year
  which  is  at  least  two-thirds  of  excess  federal  gross income; and
  provided  further  that,  in  determining  such  income  eligibility,  a
  taxpayer  may,  for  any  taxable  year, use the average of such federal
  gross income from farming for that taxable year and such income for  the
  two  consecutive  taxable years immediately preceding such taxable year.
  Excess federal gross income means the amount  of  federal  gross  income
  from  all sources for the taxable year reduced by the sum (not to exceed
  thirty thousand dollars) of those items included in federal gross income
  which consist of (i) earned income,  (ii)  pension  payments,  including
  social  security  payments,  (iii)  interest,  and  (iv)  dividends. For
  purposes of this paragraph, the term "earned income" shall  mean  wages,
  salaries, tips and other employee compensation, and those items of gross
  income  which  are  includible  in  the computation of net earnings from
  self-employment. For the purposes of this paragraph, payments  from  the
  state's  farmland  protection program, administered by the department of
  agriculture and markets, shall be included as federal gross income  from
  farming for otherwise eligible farmers.
    (3)  School  district property taxes. For purposes of this subsection,
  the term "school district property  taxes"  means  all  property  taxes,
  special   ad  valorem  levies  and  special  assessments,  exclusive  of
  penalties and interest, levied  for  school  district  purposes  on  the
  qualified  agricultural property (A) owned by the taxpayer, (B) owned by
  the father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, brother or sister  of  the
  taxpayer  and  a  written  agreement  expressing  intent  to  eventually
  purchase the land has been entered into, or (C) owned by trust where the
  taxpayer is an immediate family member of the settlor, and  where  under


 the  terms  of  the  trust  the title to the property shall pass to such
  taxpayer upon the death of the settlor.
    (4)  Qualified agricultural property. For purposes of this subsection,
  the term "qualified agricultural property" means land  located  in  this
  state  which  is used in agricultural production, and land improvements,
  structures and buildings (excluding buildings used  for  the  taxpayer's
  residential  purpose) located on such land which are used or occupied to
  carry out such production. Qualified agricultural property also includes
  land set aside or retired under a  federal  supply  management  or  soil
  conservation  program  or  land that at the time it becomes subject to a
  conservation easement, as defined under subsection (kk) of this section,
  met the requirements under this paragraph.
    (5) Acreage limitation. (A) Eligible taxes.  In  the  event  that  the
  qualified  agricultural  property owned by the taxpayer includes land in
  excess of the base acreage as provided in this paragraph, the amount  of
  school district property taxes eligible for credit under this subsection
  shall  be that portion of the school district property taxes which bears
  the same ratio to the total school district property taxes  paid  during
  the taxable year, as the acreage allowable under this paragraph bears to
  the entire acreage of such land.
    (B)  Allowable  acreage.  The allowable acreage is the sum of the base
  acreage set forth below and fifty percent of  the  incremental  acreage.
  The incremental acreage is the excess of the entire acreage of qualified
  agricultural land owned by the taxpayer over the base acreage. Except as
  provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph:
 
    For taxable years beginning:              The base acreage is:
      in 1997                                          100
      after 1997 but before 2006                       250
      2006 and thereafter                              350
 
  For  taxable  years beginning after two thousand, total base acreage may
  be increased by any acreage enrolled or participating during the taxable
  year in a federal environmental  conservation  acreage  reserve  program
  pursuant  to  title  three  of  the  federal agriculture improvement and
  reform act of nineteen hundred ninety-six.
    (C) Base acreage of related persons. Where the  taxpayer  and  one  or
  more  related  persons  each  own qualified agricultural property on the
  first day of March of any year, the base acreage under subparagraph  (B)
  of  this  paragraph  shall  be  divided  equally  and allotted among the
  taxpayer and such related persons, and the taxpayer's base  acreage  for
  the taxable year which includes such March first shall be limited to its
  allotted  share. Provided, however, if the taxpayer and all such related
  persons consent (at such time and in such manner as the commissioner may
  prescribe) to an unequal division, the taxpayer's base acreage for  such
  taxable  year  shall be limited to its allotted share under such unequal
  division.
    (D) Related persons. (i) For purposes  of  subparagraph  (C)  of  this
  paragraph, the term "related person" means:
    (I) a spouse;
    (II)  a  corporation  subject  to  tax  under  article  nine-A of this
  chapter, where more than fifty percent in value of the outstanding stock
  of the corporation is owned, directly  or  indirectly,  by  or  for  the
  taxpayer,  or,  where the taxpayer is a trust, where such stock is owned
  directly or indirectly by or for the grantor of such trust;
    (III) a partnership, estate or  trust  of  which  the  taxpayer  owns,
  directly  or indirectly, more than fifty percent of the capital, profits
  or beneficial interest.


   (ii) For purposes of subparagraph (C) of  this  paragraph,  where  the
  taxpayer  is  an  estate  or trust, the term "related person" shall also
  mean a corporation subject to tax under article nine-A of this  chapter,
  a partnership, an estate or trust:
    (I)  where  more  than fifty percent of the beneficial interest in the
  taxpayer is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for  such  corporation,
  partnership, estate or trust or by or for the grantor of such trust; or
    (II) if the same person owns more than fifty percent of the beneficial
  interest  in  the  taxpayer  and more than fifty percent in value of the
  outstanding stock of the corporation, or more than fifty percent of  the
  capital  or  profits  interest  in  the  partnership, or more than fifty
  percent of the beneficial interest in the estate or trust.
    (iii) In determining whether a person is a related person  within  the
  meaning of this subparagraph:
    (I)  stock  owned,  directly  or  indirectly, by or for a corporation,
  partnership,  estate  or  trust  shall  be  considered  as  being  owned
  proportionately by or for its shareholders, partners or beneficiaries;
    (II)  an  individual  shall  be  considered as owning the stock owned,
  directly or indirectly, by or for his spouse;
    (III) stock  constructively  owned  by  a  person  by  reason  of  the
  application  of  item  (I)  of  this  clause  shall,  for the purpose of
  applying item (I) or (II) of this clause, be treated as  actually  owned
  by such person.
    (6)  Income  limitation.  (A)  In the event that the modified New York
  adjusted gross income of  the  taxpayer  exceeds  one  hundred  thousand
  dollars  for  taxable  years  beginning  before  two thousand six or two
  hundred  thousand  dollars  for  taxable  year  two  thousand  six   and
  thereafter, the allowable school district property taxes under paragraph
  one  of  this  subsection shall be the eligible taxes under subparagraph
  (A) of paragraph five of this subsection reduced by the product  of  the
  amount  of  such  eligible taxes and a percentage, such percentage to be
  determined by  multiplying  one  hundred  percent  by  a  fraction,  the
  numerator  of  which is the lesser of fifty thousand dollars for taxable
  years beginning before two thousand six or one hundred thousand  dollars
  for  taxable  year  two thousand six and thereafter or the excess of the
  taxpayer's modified New York adjusted  gross  income  over  one  hundred
  thousand  dollars for taxable years beginning before two thousand six or
  two hundred thousand dollars for  taxable  year  two  thousand  six  and
  thereafter  and  the  denominator of which is fifty thousand dollars for
  taxable years beginning before two thousand six or one hundred  thousand
  dollars  for  taxable year two thousand six and thereafter. For purposes
  of the preceding sentence, the term "eligible taxes", where the  acreage
  limitation  of  paragraph  five of this subsection does not apply, shall
  mean the total school district property taxes paid  during  the  taxable
  year.
    (B)  The  term "modified New York adjusted gross income" means the New
  York adjusted gross income for the taxable year reduced by the amount of
  principal paid on farm indebtedness during the taxable  year.  The  term
  "farm  indebtedness"  means debt incurred or refinanced which is secured
  by farm property, where the proceeds  of  the  debt  are  disbursed  for
  expenditures incurred in the business of farming.
    (7)  Nonqualified  use. (A) No credit in conversion year. In the event
  that qualified agricultural property is converted  by  the  taxpayer  to
  nonqualified use, credit under this subsection shall not be allowed with
  respect  to  such  property  for  the  taxable  year  of conversion (the
  conversion year).
    (B) Credit recapture. If the conversion by the taxpayer  of  qualified
  agricultural  property  to  nonqualified use occurs during the period of


 the two taxable years following the taxable year for  which  the  credit
  under  this  subsection was first claimed with respect to such property,
  the credit allowed with respect to such property for the  taxable  years
  prior  to the conversion year must be added back in the conversion year.
  Where the property converted includes land, and where the conversion  is
  of  only  a portion of such land, the credit allowed with respect to the
  property converted shall be determined by multiplying the entire  credit
  under this subsection for the taxable years prior to the conversion year
  by  a  fraction, the numerator of which is the acreage converted and the
  denominator of which is the entire acreage of such  land  owned  by  the
  taxpayer immediately prior to the conversion.
    (C)  Exception  to recapture. Subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall
  not apply to the conversion of  property  where  the  conversion  is  by
  reason  of  involuntary  conversion,  within  the meaning of section one
  thousand thirty-three of the internal revenue code.
    (D) Conversion to nonqualified use. For purposes of this paragraph,  a
  sale or other disposition of qualified agricultural property alone shall
  not constitute a conversion to a nonqualified use.
    (8)  Special rules. For purposes of this subsection, the term "federal
  gross  income  from  farming"  shall  include  gross  income  from   the
  production of maple syrup, cider, Christmas trees derived from a managed
  Christmas  tree  operation whether dug for transplanting or cut from the
  stump, or from a commercial  horse  boarding  operation  as  defined  in
  subdivision thirteen of section three hundred one of the agriculture and
  markets  law,  or  from  the sale of wine from a licensed farm winery as
  provided for in article six of the alcoholic beverage  control  law,  or
  from  the  sale  of cider from a licensed farm cidery as provided for in
  section fifty-eight-c of the alcoholic beverage control law.
    (9) Election to deem  gross  income  of  New  York  C  corporation  to
  shareholders.  (A)  General.  For  purposes  of  the  credit  under this
  subsection, the shareholders of an eligible  corporation  may  elect  to
  take  into account their pro rata shares of the corporation's income and
  principal payments on farm indebtedness as provided in subparagraph  (B)
  of  this  paragraph, for the taxable year of the corporation ending with
  or within the taxable year of each shareholder. No election  under  this
  paragraph  shall  be  effective  unless  shareholders  holding more than
  one-half, by vote and value, of the shares of stock of  the  corporation
  on the day on which the election is made have so elected.
    (B)  Inclusion in gross and adjusted gross income. (i) For any taxable
  year of the corporation for which the election under this  paragraph  is
  in effect, the shareholders of the corporation shall include:
    (I) in gross income, for purposes of paragraph two of this subsection,
  their  pro  rata  shares of the corporation's gross income, which income
  shall have the same character as in the hands of the corporation, and
    (II) in adjusted gross income, for purposes of paragraph six  of  this
  subsection,  their  pro  rata  shares  of  the  corporation's entire net
  income, and
    (III) in principal payments on  farm  indebtedness,  for  purposes  of
  paragraph six of this subsection, their pro rata shares of such payments
  made by the corporation.
    (ii) Tiered New York C and New York S corporation. In the event that a
  shareholder of the corporation is a New York S corporation, the New York
  S corporation shall make the inclusions prescribed by clause (i) of this
  subparagraph  (except that the inclusion prescribed by subclause (II) of
  such clause shall be in  the  entire  net  income  of  the  New  York  S
  corporation),  and  the  New  York S corporation shall pass through such
  inclusions in pro rata shares to its shareholders for purposes of  their
  calculation of credit under this subsection.


   (C)  Eligible  corporation.  The  term  "eligible corporation" means a
  corporation subject to tax under article nine-A of this chapter which is
  a New York C corporation for federal income tax purposes.
    (D) Pro rata share. For purposes of this paragraph, the pro rata share
  of  any  item  of  income  or farm indebtedness principal payments for a
  taxable year of the corporation shall be determined with  respect  to  a
  shareholder  by  assigning  an  equal portion of the item to each day of
  such taxable year, and then by dividing that portion pro rata among  the
  shares outstanding on such day.
    (E) Election. (i) An election under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph
  shall  be  made  on such form and in such manner as the commissioner may
  prescribe.
    (ii) When made. Such election shall be made no later than the due date
  of the corporation tax return (determined without regard to  extensions)
  for  the  corporation's  taxable  year  for  which the election is to be
  effective.
    (iii) When effective. Such election shall be effective for the taxable
  year of the corporation for which it is  made  and  for  all  succeeding
  taxable  years  of  the  corporation,  until such election is terminated
  under subparagraph (F) of this paragraph.
    (F) Termination. (i) Revocation. An election under subparagraph (A) of
  this paragraph shall be terminated if  shareholders  holding  more  than
  one-half,  by  vote and value, of the shares of stock of the corporation
  on the day on which the revocation is made  revoke  the  election.  Such
  revocation  shall  be  made  on  such  form  and  in  such manner as the
  commissioner may prescribe, and shall be effective on the first  day  of
  the   corporation's  taxable  year  following  the  date  on  which  the
  revocation is made.
    (ii) Ineligible corporation. An election  under  subparagraph  (A)  of
  this paragraph shall be terminated on the first day of the corporation's
  taxable  year  with  respect  to  which  the corporation ceases to be an
  eligible corporation.
    (G) Election after termination. If an  election  is  terminated  under
  subparagraph   (F)   of   this  paragraph,  no  further  election  under
  subparagraph (A) of this  paragraph  shall  be  made  before  the  fifth
  taxable  year of the corporation following the taxable year during which
  the termination occurred,  unless  the  commissioner  consents  to  such
  election.
    (H) Waiver of secrecy. The commissioner shall have authority to reveal
  to  shareholders  of  the  corporation  any  information with respect to
  income or farm indebtedness principal payments of the  corporation,  for
  any  taxable  year  of the corporation for which the election under this
  paragraph is in effect, which is the basis for denial  in  whole  or  in
  part of the credit claimed by such shareholders.
    (n-1)  Homeowner  tax  rebate  credit.  (1) An individual taxpayer who
  meets the eligibility standards in  paragraph  two  of  this  subsection
  shall  be  allowed a credit against the taxes imposed by this article in
  the amount specified in paragraph three of this subsection for tax  year
  two thousand twenty-two.
    (2)  To  be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer (or taxpayers filing
  joint returns) (a) must  own  and  primarily  reside  in  real  property
  receiving  either  the STAR exemption authorized by section four hundred
  twenty-five of the real property tax law or the school tax relief credit
  authorized by subsection (eee) of this section, and (b)  must  have  had
  qualified  gross  income  no  greater  than  two  hundred fifty thousand
  dollars in tax year two thousand twenty.
    (3) Amount of credit. (a) For  a  taxpayer  who  owned  and  primarily
  resided  in  real  property  receiving  the  basic STAR exemption or who


 received the basic STAR credit, the amount of the credit shall equal the
  STAR tax savings associated with such basic STAR exemption  in  the  two
  thousand  twenty-one--two thousand twenty-two school year, multiplied by
  the following percentage:
    (i) For a taxpayer whose primary residence is located outside the city
  of New York:
  Qualified Gross Income                  Percentage
  Not over $75,000                        163%
  Over $75,000 but not over $150,000      115%
  Over $150,000 but not over $200,000     66%
  Over $200,000 but not over $250,000     18%
  Over $250,000                           No credit
    (ii) For a taxpayer whose primary residence is located within the city
  of New York:
  Qualified Gross Income                  Percentage
  Not over $75,000                        125%
  Over $75,000 but not over $150,000      115%
  Over $150,000 but not over $200,000     105%
  Over $200,000 but not over $250,000     100%
  Over $250,000                           No credit
    (b)  For  a  taxpayer who owned and primarily resided in real property
  receiving the enhanced STAR exemption or who received the enhanced  STAR
  credit,  the  amount  of  the  credit  shall  equal the STAR tax savings
  associated with  such  enhanced  STAR  exemption  in  the  two  thousand
  twenty-one--two thousand twenty-two school year, multiplied by sixty-six
  percent  if the taxpayer's primary residence is located outside the city
  of New York, or one  hundred  ten  percent  if  the  taxpayer's  primary
  residence is located within the city of New York.
    (c)  In  no  case  may  the  amount  of  the credit allowed under this
  subsection exceed the school district taxes  due  with  respect  to  the
  residence  for  that  school year, nor shall any credit be allowed under
  this subsection if the amount determined pursuant to this  paragraph  is
  less than one hundred dollars.
    (4) For purposes of this subsection:
    (a)  "Qualified  gross  income" means the adjusted gross income of the
  qualified taxpayer for the taxable year as reported for  federal  income
  tax  purposes,  or which would be reported as adjusted gross income if a
  federal income tax return  were  required  to  be  filed.  In  computing
  qualified  gross  income,  the  net  amount  of loss reported on Federal
  Schedule C, D, E, or F shall  not  exceed  three  thousand  dollars  per
  schedule.  In addition, the net amount of any other separate category of
  loss shall not exceed three thousand dollars. The  aggregate  amount  of
  all losses included in computing qualified gross income shall not exceed
  fifteen thousand dollars.
    (b) "STAR tax savings" means the tax savings attributable to the basic
  or enhanced STAR exemption, whichever is applicable, within a portion of
  a  school  district,  as  determined  by  the  commissioner  pursuant to
  subdivision two of section thirteen hundred six-a of the  real  property
  tax law.
    (5)  If  the  amount of the credit allowed under this subsection shall
  exceed the taxpayer's tax for the taxable  year,  the  excess  shall  be
  treated  as  an  overpayment  of  tax  to  be  credited  or  refunded in
  accordance with the provisions of section six hundred eighty-six of this
  article, provided, however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.  For
  each year this credit is allowed, on or before October fifteenth of such
  year,  or  as  soon thereafter as is practicable, the commissioner shall
  determine the taxpayer's  eligibility  for  this  credit  utilizing  the
  information  available  to  the  commissioner on the taxpayer's personal


 income tax return filed for the taxable year  two  years  prior  to  the
  taxable  year  in  which the credit is allowed. For those taxpayers whom
  the  commissioner  has  determined  eligible  for   this   credit,   the
  commissioner  shall  advance  a  payment  in  the  amount  specified  in
  paragraph three of this subsection, which payment shall  be  issued,  to
  the  greatest  extent  practicable, by October thirty-first of each year
  the credit is allowed. A taxpayer who has failed to receive  an  advance
  payment  that  he  or  she  believes  was  due to him or her, or who has
  received an advance payment that he or she believes  is  less  than  the
  amount  that  was  due to him or her, may request payment of the claimed
  deficiency in a manner prescribed by the commissioner.
    (6) A taxpayer shall not be eligible for the credit allowed under this
  subsection if the school district taxes levied upon the residence during
  the taxable year remain unpaid sixty days after the last date  on  which
  they  could  have been paid without interest, or in the case of a school
  district where such taxes are payable in  installments,  if  such  taxes
  remain  unpaid  sixty  days  after  the  last  date  on  which the final
  installment could have been paid without interest. If the  taxes  remain
  unpaid  on  such  sixtieth  day,  the  amount  of  credit claimed by the
  taxpayer under this subsection or  the  amount  of  advance  payment  of
  credit  received  by  the  taxpayer  pursuant  to paragraph five of this
  subsection shall be added back as tax on the income tax return  for  the
  taxable year in which such sixtieth day occurs.
    (7)  Only  one  credit per residence shall be allowed per taxable year
  under this subsection. When two or more members of a residence are  able
  to meet the qualifications for a qualified taxpayer, the credit shall be
  equally  divided  between  or  among  such  individuals.  In the case of
  spouses who file  a  joint  federal  return  but  who  are  required  to
  determine  their  New York taxes separately, the credit allowed pursuant
  to this subsection may be applied against the tax of either  or  divided
  between them as they may elect.
    (n-2)  Credit for farm donations to food pantries. (1) General. In the
  case of a taxpayer who is an eligible farmer, there shall be  allowed  a
  credit,  to be computed as hereinafter provided, against the tax imposed
  by this article for taxable years beginning on and after January  first,
  two  thousand  eighteen.  The  amount of the credit shall be twenty-five
  percent of the fair market value of the taxpayer's  qualified  donations
  made  to any eligible food pantry during the taxable year, not to exceed
  five thousand dollars per taxable year. If the taxpayer is a partner  in
  a partnership or a shareholder of a New York S corporation, then the cap
  imposed  by the preceding sentence shall be applied at the entity level,
  so that the aggregate credit allowed to all partners or shareholders  of
  such entity in the taxable year does not exceed five thousand dollars.
    (2)  Eligible  farmer.  For  purposes  of  this  subsection,  the term
  "eligible farmer" means a  taxpayer  whose  federal  gross  income  from
  farming  for  the  taxable year is at least two-thirds of excess federal
  gross income.  Excess federal gross income means the amount  of  federal
  gross  income  from  all sources for the taxable year reduced by the sum
  (not to exceed thirty thousand  dollars)  of  those  items  included  in
  federal  gross  income  that consist of: (i) earned income, (ii) pension
  payments, including social security payments, (iii) interest,  and  (iv)
  dividends.  For  purposes  of  this  paragraph, the term "earned income"
  shall mean wages, salaries, tips and other  employee  compensation,  and
  those  items  of  gross income that are includible in the computation of
  net earnings from self-employment. For the purposes of  this  paragraph,
  payments  from  the state's farmland protection program, administered by
  the department of agriculture and markets, shall be included as  federal
  gross income from farming for otherwise eligible farmers.


   (3)  Qualified  donation.  For  purposes  of this subsection, the term
  "qualified donation" means a donation of any apparently wholesome  food,
  as  defined  in  section  170(e)(3)(C)(vi) of the internal revenue code,
  grown or produced within  this  state,  by  an  eligible  farmer  to  an
  eligible food pantry.
    (4)  Eligible  food  pantry. For purposes of this subsection, the term
  "eligible food pantry" means  any  food  pantry,  food  bank,  or  other
  emergency  food  program  operating within this state that has qualified
  for tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code.
    (5)  Determination  of  fair  market  value.  For  purposes  of   this
  subsection,  to  determine the fair market value of apparently wholesome
  food donated to an eligible food pantry, the standards set  forth  under
  section 170(e)(3)(C)(v) of the internal revenue code shall apply.
    (6)  Record  of  donation.  To claim a credit under this subsection, a
  taxpayer must get and keep a  receipt  from  the  eligible  food  pantry
  showing:  (i)  the  name  of the eligible food pantry; (ii) the date and
  location of the qualified donation;  and  (iii)  a  reasonably  detailed
  description  of  the  qualified  donation.  A  letter  or  other written
  communication from the eligible food pantry acknowledging receipt of the
  contribution and containing the information in subparagraphs (i),  (ii),
  and (iii) of this paragraph will serve as a receipt.
    (7)  Application of credit. A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit under
  this subsection against the tax imposed by this article. However, if the
  amount of credit allowed under this  subsection  for  any  taxable  year
  exceeds  the taxpayer's tax for such year, the excess will be treated as
  an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded in accordance with  the
  provisions  of section six hundred eighty-six of this article. Provided,
  however, the  provisions  of  subsection  (c)  of  section  six  hundred
  eighty-eight  of  this article notwithstanding, no interest will be paid
  thereon.
    (o) Credit for employment of persons with disabilities. (1)  Allowance
  of  credit.  A  taxpayer  shall  be  allowed a credit, to be computed as
  hereinafter provided, against the  tax  imposed  by  this  article,  for
  employing within the state a qualified employee.
    (2) Qualified employee. A qualified employee is an individual:
    (A) who is certified by the education department, or in the case of an
  individual  who  is  blind  or visually handicapped, by the state agency
  responsible for provision of vocation  rehabilitation  services  to  the
  blind  and visually handicapped: (i) as a person with a disability which
  constitutes or results in a substantial handicap to employment and  (ii)
  as  having  completed  or  as receiving services under an individualized
  written rehabilitation plan approved  by  the  education  department  or
  other  state  agency responsible for providing vocational rehabilitation
  services to such individual; and
    (B) who has worked on a  full-time  basis  for  the  employer  who  is
  claiming the credit for at least one hundred eighty days or four hundred
  hours.
    (3)  Amount  of  credit.  Except as provided in paragraph four of this
  subsection, the amount of credit shall be  thirty-five  percent  of  the
  first  six thousand dollars in qualified first-year wages earned by each
  qualified employee. "Qualified first-year wages"  means  wages  paid  or
  incurred  by the taxpayer during the taxable year to qualified employees
  which are attributable, with respect to any such employee,  to  services
  rendered  during the one-year period beginning with the day the employee
  begins work for the taxpayer.
    (4) Credit where federal work opportunity  tax  credit  applies.  With
  respect to any qualified employee whose qualified first-year wages under
  paragraph  three of this subsection also constitute qualified first-year


 wages for purposes of the work opportunity  tax  credit  for  vocational
  rehabilitation referrals under section fifty-one of the internal revenue
  code,  the  amount  of credit under this subsection shall be thirty-five
  percent of the first six thousand dollars in qualified second-year wages
  earned  by each such employee. "Qualified second-year wages" means wages
  paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable  year  to  qualified
  employees  which are attributable, with respect to any such employee, to
  services rendered during the one-year period beginning  one  year  after
  the employee begins work for the taxpayer.
    (5) Carryover. If the amount of credit allowable under this subsection
  for  any taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year, the
  excess may be carried over to the following year or years,  and  may  be
  deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years.
    (6)  Coordination  with  federal  work  opportunity  tax  credit.  The
  provisions of sections fifty-one and fifty-two of the  internal  revenue
  code,  as  such  sections  applied  on  October  first, nineteen hundred
  ninety-six, that apply to the work opportunity tax credit for vocational
  rehabilitation referrals shall apply to the credit under this subsection
  to the extent that  such  sections  are  consistent  with  the  specific
  provisions  of this subsection, provided that in the event of a conflict
  the provisions of this subsection shall control.
    (p) Alternative fuels and electric vehicle recharging property credit.
  (1) General. A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit,  to  be  computed  as
  hereinafter  provided,  against  the  tax  imposed  by this article, for
  alternative fuel  vehicle  refueling  and  electric  vehicle  recharging
  property placed in service during the taxable year.
    (2)  (a)  Alternative  fuel  vehicle  refueling  property and electric
  vehicle recharging  property.  The  credit  under  this  subsection  for
  alternative   fuel   vehicle  refueling  property  or  electric  vehicle
  recharging property shall equal for each installation  of  property  the
  lesser  of five thousand dollars or the product of fifty percent and the
  cost of any such property less any  costs  paid  from  the  proceeds  of
  grants.
    (b) To qualify for the credit, the property must:
    (i) be located in this state;
    (ii)   constitute  alternative  fuel  vehicle  refueling  property  or
  electric vehicle recharging property; and
    (iii) not be paid for from  the  proceeds  of  grants  awarded  before
  January  first, two thousand fifteen, including grants from the New York
  state energy research and development authority or the  New  York  power
  authority.
    (3)  Definitions.  (A)  The  term  "alternative fuel vehicle refueling
  property" means all of the equipment needed  to  dispense  any  fuel  at
  least eighty-five percent of the volume of which consists of one or more
  of   the  following:  natural  gas,  liquified  natural  gas,  liquified
  petroleum, or hydrogen; and
    (B) The term "electric vehicle  recharging  property"  means  all  the
  equipment  needed  to  convey  electric  power from the electric grid or
  another power source to an onboard vehicle energy storage system.
    (4)  Carryovers.  If  the  amount  of  credit  allowable  under   this
  subsection shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year, the excess may
  be  carried over to the following year or years and may be deducted from
  the taxpayer's tax for such year or years.
    (5) Credit recapture. (A) If, at  any  time  before  the  end  of  its
  recovery period, alternative fuel vehicle refueling property or electric
  vehicle  recharging  property ceases to be qualified, a recapture amount
  must be added back in the tax year in which such cessation occurs.


   (B) Cessation of qualification.  Alternative  fuel  vehicle  refueling
  property  or electric vehicle recharging property ceases to be qualified
  if:
    (i)  the  property  no  longer  qualifies  as alternative fuel vehicle
  refueling property or electric vehicle recharging property, or
    (ii) fifty percent or more of the use of the  property  in  a  taxable
  year is other than in a trade or business in this state, or
    (iii) the taxpayer receiving the credit under this subsection sells or
  disposes  of  the  property  and  knows  or  has reason to know that the
  property will be used in a manner described in clause  (i)  or  (ii)  of
  this subparagraph.
    (C)  Recapture  amount.  The  recapture  amount is equal to the credit
  allowable under this subsection multiplied by a fraction, the  numerator
  of  which is the total recovery period for the property minus the number
  of recovery years prior to, but not including, the recapture  year,  and
  the denominator of which is the total recovery period.
    (6) Termination. The credit allowed by this subsection shall not apply
  in  taxable  years  beginning  after December thirty-first, two thousand
  twenty-five.
    (q) Qualified emerging technology company  employment  credit.  (1)  A
  taxpayer  shall  be  allowed  a  credit,  to  be computed as hereinafter
  provided, against the tax imposed by this article, provided:
    (A) the  taxpayer  is  a  sole  proprietor  of  a  qualified  emerging
  technology  company,  a  member  of  a  partnership which is a qualified
  emerging  technology  company,  or  a  shareholder  of  a  New  York   S
  corporation which is a qualified emerging technology company, as defined
  in section thirty-one hundred two-e of the public authorities law; and
    (B)  the  average  number  of  individuals  employed full-time by such
  company in New York state during  the  taxable  year  is  at  least  one
  hundred  one  percent  of  such  company's base year employment. For the
  purposes of this subsection, "base year employment"  means  the  average
  number  of  individuals  employed full-time by such company in the state
  during the three taxable years immediately preceding the  first  taxable
  year  in  which  the  credit  is  claimed.  Where  such company provided
  full-time employment within the state during  only  a  portion  of  such
  three-year period, then for purposes of this subsection, the term "three
  years"  shall  be  deemed  to  refer  instead to such portion, provided,
  however, the first taxable year for which this credit may be taken  with
  respect  to such company shall be the next year following the first full
  taxable year that such company had  full-time  employment  in  New  York
  state.
    (2)  The  credit  shall  be  allowed only in the first taxable year in
  which the credit is claimed and in each of the next two  taxable  years,
  provided  that  the  conditions  of paragraph one of this subsection are
  satisfied in each taxable year.
    (3) For the purposes of this subsection, average number of individuals
  employed full-time shall be  computed  by  adding  the  number  of  such
  individuals  employed  by such company at the end of each quarter during
  each taxable year or other applicable period and  dividing  the  sum  so
  obtained  by  the  number of such quarters occurring within such taxable
  year or other applicable period; provided, however,  that  in  computing
  base year employment there shall be excluded therefrom any employee with
  respect  to  whom  a  credit  provided  for under subsection (k) of this
  section is claimed for the taxable year.
    (4) The amount of the credit shall equal the product of  one  thousand
  dollars  multiplied  by  the number of individuals employed full-time by
  such company in the taxable year that  are  in  excess  of  one  hundred
  percent of such company's base year employment.


   (5)  If  the  amount  of  credit allowed under this subsection for any
  taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year,  the  excess
  shall  be treated as an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded in
  accordance with the provisions of section six hundred eighty-six of this
  article, provided, however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.
    (r)  Qualified  emerging  technology company capital tax credit. (1) A
  taxpayer shall be allowed a credit  against  the  tax  imposed  by  this
  article. The amount of the credit shall be equal to one of the following
  percentages,  per  each  qualified  investment  in  a qualified emerging
  technology company as defined in section thirty-one hundred two-e of the
  public authorities law, made during the taxable year, and  certified  by
  the commissioner, either:
    (A)  ten  percent  of  qualified  investments  in  qualified  emerging
  technology companies, except for investments made by or on behalf of  an
  owner  of  the  business,  including, but not limited to, a stockholder,
  partner or sole  proprietor,  or  any  related  person,  as  defined  in
  subparagraph  (C)  of  paragraph three of subsection (b) of section four
  hundred sixty-five of the internal revenue code, and provided,  however,
  that  the  taxpayer  certifies  to  the  commissioner that the qualified
  investment will not be sold, transferred, traded, or disposed of  during
  the  four years following the year in which the credit is first claimed;
  or
    (B) twenty percent of  qualified  investments  in  qualified  emerging
  technology  companies, except for investments made by or on behalf of an
  owner of the business, including, but not  limited  to,  a  stockholder,
  partner  or  sole  proprietor,  or  any  related  person,  as defined in
  subparagraph (C) of paragraph three of subsection (b)  of  section  four
  hundred  sixty-five of the internal revenue code, and provided, however,
  that the taxpayer certifies  to  the  commissioner  that  the  qualified
  investment  will not be sold, transferred, traded, or disposed of during
  the nine years following the year in which the credit is first claimed.
    (C) "Qualified investment" means the contribution  of  property  to  a
  corporation  in  exchange  for  original  issue  capital  stock or other
  ownership interest, the contribution of property  to  a  partnership  in
  exchange  for  an interest in the partnership, and similar contributions
  in the case of a business entity not in corporate or partnership form in
  exchange for an ownership interest in such entity. The total  amount  of
  credit allowable to a taxpayer under this provision for all years, taken
  in the aggregate, shall not exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars in
  the  case  of  investments  made  pursuant  to  subparagraph (A) of this
  paragraph and shall not exceed three hundred  thousand  dollars  in  the
  case of investments made pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
    (2)  (A)  If  the  amount  of the credit and carryovers of such credit
  allowed under this subsection for any  taxable  year  shall  exceed  the
  taxpayer's tax for such year, any amount of credit or carryovers of such
  credit  thus  not deductible in such taxable year may be carried over to
  the following year or years and may be deducted from the  tax  for  such
  year or years. In addition, the amount of such credit, and carryovers of
  such credit to the taxable year, deducted from the tax otherwise due may
  not,  in  the  aggregate,  exceed fifty percent of the tax imposed under
  section six hundred one computed without regard to any  credit  provided
  for by this section.
    (B)  In  the  case  of  a  husband  or  wife who is required to file a
  separate return, the limitations provided for  in  subparagraph  (c)  of
  paragraph  one of this subsection shall be seventy-five thousand dollars
  in lieu of one hundred fifty thousand dollars,  and  one  hundred  fifty
  thousand  dollars  in lieu of three hundred thousand dollars, unless the
  spouse of the taxpayer has no credit allowable under this subsection for


 the taxable year of such spouse which ends within or with the taxpayer's
  taxable year.
    (C) In the case of an estate or trust, the limitations provided for in
  paragraph  one  of  this  subsection shall be reduced to an amount which
  bears the same ratio to one hundred fifty thousand dollars and an amount
  which bears the same ratio to three  hundred  thousand  dollars  as  the
  portion  of  the income of the estate or trust which is not allocated to
  beneficiaries bears to the total income of the estate or trust.
    (3) (A) Where a taxpayer sells, transfers  or  otherwise  disposes  of
  corporate  stock,  a  partnership  interest  or other ownership interest
  arising from the making of a qualified investment which was  the  basis,
  in  whole or in part, for the allowance of the credit provided for under
  subparagraph (A) of paragraph  one  of  this  subsection,  or  where  an
  investment  which  was  the  basis for such allowance is, in whole or in
  part, recovered by such  taxpayer,  and  such  disposition  or  recovery
  occurs  during  the  taxable  year or within forty-eight months from the
  close of the taxable year with respect to which such credit is  allowed,
  the  taxpayer  shall add back, with respect to the taxable year in which
  the disposition or  recovery  described  above  occurred,  the  required
  portion of the credit originally allowed.
    (B)  Where  a  taxpayer  sells,  transfers  or  otherwise  disposes of
  corporate stock, a partnership  interest  or  other  ownership  interest
  arising  from  the making of a qualified investment which was the basis,
  in whole or in part, for the allowance of the credit provided for  under
  subparagraph  (B)  of  paragraph  one  of  this  subsection, or where an
  investment which was the basis for such allowance is in any  manner,  in
  whole  or  in  part, recovered by such taxpayer, and such disposition or
  recovery occurs during the taxable year  or  within  one  hundred  eight
  months  from  the  close  of the taxable year with respect to which such
  credit is allowed, the taxpayer shall add  back,  with  respect  to  the
  taxable   year  in  which  the  disposition  or  recovery  described  in
  subparagraph one of this paragraph occurred the required portion of  the
  credit originally allowed.
    (C) The required portion of the credit originally allowed shall be the
  product  of  (i) the portion of such credit attributable to the property
  disposed of and (ii) the applicable percentage.
    (D) The applicable percentage shall be:
    (i) for credits allowed pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph  one
  of this subsection:
    (I)  one hundred percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs within
  the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed  or  within
  twelve months of the end of such taxable year,
    (II)  seventy-five percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs more
  than twelve but not more than twenty-four months after the  end  of  the
  taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed,
    (III)  fifty  percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs more than
  twenty-four months but not more than thirty-six months after the end  of
  the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed, or

  end of the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed; or
    (ii) for credits allowed pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph one

  year with respect to which the credit is allowed,

  the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed, or
    (V) twenty percent, if the disposition or recovery  occurs  more  than
  ninety-six  months  but not more than one hundred eight months after the
  end of the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed.
    (s) Credit for purchase of  an  automated  external  defibrillator.  A
  taxpayer  shall be allowed a credit as hereinafter provided, against the
  tax imposed by this article for the purchase, other than for resale,  of
  an  automated external defibrillator, as such term is defined in section
  three thousand-b of the public health law. The amount of credit shall be
  the cost to the taxpayer of automated external defibrillators  purchased
  during  the taxable year, such credit not to exceed five hundred dollars
  with respect to each unit purchased.

  paragraph  four of subsection (d) of section six hundred fifteen of this
  article, for allowable college tuition expenses.
    (2) Allowable and qualified college tuition expenses. For the purposes

  by the taxpayer during the taxable year, limited to ten thousand dollars
  for each such student;
    (B)   The  term  "eligible  student"  shall  mean  the  taxpayer,  the
  taxpayer's spouse, and any dependent of the  taxpayer  with  respect  to
  whom  the  taxpayer  is  allowed  an exemption under section six hundred
  sixteen of this article for the taxable year;
    (C) The term "qualified  college  tuition  expenses"  shall  mean  the
  tuition required for the enrollment or attendance of an eligible student
  at  an  institution  of  higher  education.  Provided,  however, tuition
  payments made pursuant to the receipt of any scholarships  or  financial
  aid,  or  tuition  required  for enrollment or attendance in a course of
  study leading to the granting of a post baccalaureate or other  graduate
  degree,  shall  be  excluded  from  the definition of "qualified college
  tuition expenses".
    (D) Expenses paid by dependent. If  an  exemption  under  section  six
  hundred sixteen of this article with respect to an individual is allowed
  to another taxpayer for a taxable year beginning in the calendar year in
  which such individual's taxable year begins,
    (i)  no credit under this subsection or deduction under paragraph four
  of subsection (d) of section six hundred fifteen of this  article  shall
  be allowed to such individual for such individual's taxable year, and
    (ii)  for  purposes  of  such  credit  or deduction, qualified college
  tuition expenses  paid  by  such  individual  during  such  individual's
  taxable year shall be treated as paid by such other taxpayer.
    (3)  Institution  of higher education. For the purposes of this credit
  and the itemized deduction provided by paragraph four of subdivision (d)
  of section six hundred fifteen of this article, the term "institution of


 higher education" shall mean any  institution  of  higher  education  or
  business,  trade, technical or other occupational school, recognized and
  approved  by  the  regents,  or  any  successor  organization,  of   the

  recognized accrediting agency or association accepted  as  such  by  the
  regents,  or  any successor organization, of the university of the state
  of New York, which provides a course of study leading to the granting of
  a post-secondary degree, certificate or diploma.
    (4) Amount of credit. If allowable college tuition expenses  are  less
  than five thousand dollars, the amount of the credit provided under this
  subsection  shall be equal to the applicable percentage of the lesser of
  allowable college tuition expenses or two hundred dollars. If  allowable
  college  tuition  expenses are five thousand dollars or more, the amount
  of the credit provided under this  subsection  shall  be  equal  to  the
  applicable   percentage   of  the  allowable  college  tuition  expenses
  multiplied  by  four  percent.  Such  applicable  percentage  shall   be
  twenty-five  percent  for  taxable  years beginning in two thousand one,
  fifty  percent  for  taxable  years  beginning  in  two  thousand   two,
  seventy-five  percent  for taxable years beginning in two thousand three

  against the taxes imposed by this article for the taxable  year  reduced
  by  the credits permitted by this article. If the credit exceeds the tax
  as so reduced, the taxpayer may receive, and the comptroller, subject to
  a certificate of the commissioner, shall pay as an overpayment,  without
  interest, the amount of such excess.
    (6)  Limitation. No credit shall be allowed under this subsection to a

  provided in this  subsection  shall  be  allowed  for  all  expenditures
  referenced in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph paid or incurred in the
  two  preceding  taxable  years  that the taxpayer was located in such an
  incubator facility for employees of the taxpayer who also relocate  from
  said  incubator  facility  to  such  New  York site and are employed and
  primarily located by the taxpayer in New York. Such expenditures in  the
  two  preceding  years shall be added to the amounts otherwise qualifying
  for the credit provided by this subsection that were paid or incurred in
  the taxable year that the taxpayer relocated from such a facility.  Such
  expenditures  shall  include  expenses  paid or incurred for an eligible
  employee who is a full-time, full-year employee of said taxpayer  during
  the  taxable year that the taxpayer relocated from an incubator facility


 notwithstanding (i) that such employee was employed full or part-time as
  an officer, staff-person or  paid  intern  of  the  taxpayer  when  such
  taxpayer  was  located  at  such  incubator  facility  or (ii) that such
  employee was not continuously employed when such taxpayer was located at
  the  incubator  facility  during  the  one  hundred  eighty  day  period
  referenced in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph, provided such employee
  received wages or equivalent income for at  least  seven  hundred  fifty
  hours  during any twenty-four month period when the taxpayer was located
  at the incubator facility. Such expenditures shall include payments made
  to such an employee after the taxpayer has relocated from the  incubator
  facility  for  qualified  expenditures  if  such  payments  are  made to
  reimburse such an  employee  for  qualified  expenditures  paid  by  the
  employee during such two preceding years. The credit provided under this
  subparagraph  shall be allowed, in any year that said taxpayer qualifies
  as an eligible taxpayer.
    (e) For purposes of this subsection the  term  "academic  year"  shall
  mean  the  annual  period  of  sessions  of  a post-secondary college or
  university.
    (f) For the purposes of this subsection the term  "academic  incubator
  facility"  shall  mean  a  facility  providing low-cost space, technical
  assistance, support services and  educational  opportunities,  including
  but  not  limited  to  central  services  provided by the manager of the
  facility to the tenants of the facility, to an  entity  located  in  New
  York state. Such entity's primary activity must be an activity described
  in  paragraph (b) of subdivision one of section thirty-one hundred two-e
  of the public authorities law, and such entity must be in the  formative
  stage  of  development.  The  academic incubator facility and the entity
  must act in partnership with an  accredited  post-secondary  college  or
  university  located  in New York state. An academic incubator facility's
  mission shall be to promote job creation,  entrepreneurship,  technology
  transfer,  and provide support services to incubator tenants, including,
  but  not  limited  to,   business   planning,   management   assistance,
  financial-packaging,  linkages  to  financing services, and coordinating
  with other sources of assistance.
    (6) An eligible taxpayer may claim credits under this  subsection  for
  four  consecutive  taxable years, except, if a taxpayer is located in an
  academic incubator facility and relocates within New  York  state  to  a
  nonacademic  incubator  site, then the taxpayer (i) may make a revocable
  election to defer the credit provided under this subsection to the first
  taxable year beginning after the taxpayer  relocates  from  an  academic
  incubator  facility, and (ii) shall be eligible for such credit for five
  consecutive  years.  In  no  case  shall  the  credit  allowed  by  this
  subsection  to  a taxpayer exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars per
  year. If the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership or shareholder of  a
  New York S corporation, then the limit imposed by the preceding sentence
  shall  be  applied  at  the  entity  level, so that the aggregate credit
  allowed to all the partners or shareholders of each such entity  in  the
  taxable year does not exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars.
    (7)  If  the  amount  of  credit allowed under this subsection for any
  taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year,  the  excess
  shall  be treated as an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded in
  accordance with the provisions of section six hundred eighty-six of this
  article, provided, however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.
    (8) The credit allowed under this subsection shall not  be  applicable
  for  taxable  years  beginning  on  or after January first, two thousand
  twelve.
    (oo) Credit for rehabilitation of historic  properties.  (1)  (A)  For
  taxable  years beginning on or after January first, two thousand ten and


 before January first, two thousand thirty, a taxpayer shall be allowed a
  credit as hereinafter provided, against the tax imposed by this article,
  in an amount equal to one  hundred  percent  of  the  amount  of  credit
  allowed the taxpayer with respect to a certified historic structure, and
  one  hundred  fifty percent of the amount of credit allowed the taxpayer
  with respect to a certified historic structure that is a small  project,
  under  internal revenue code section 47(c)(3), determined without regard
  to ratably allocating the credit over a five year period as required  by
  subsection  (a) of such section 47, with respect to a certified historic
  structure located within the state. Provided, however, the credit  shall
  not exceed five million dollars. For taxable years beginning on or after
  January first, two thousand thirty, a taxpayer shall be allowed a credit
  as  hereinafter provided, against the tax imposed by this article, in an
  amount equal to thirty percent of  the  amount  of  credit  allowed  the
  taxpayer  with  respect to a certified historic structure under internal
  revenue code section 47(c)(3),  determined  without  regard  to  ratably
  allocating  the credit over a five year period as required by subsection
  (a) of such section 47, with respect to a certified  historic  structure
  located within the state; provided, however, the credit shall not exceed
  one hundred thousand dollars.
    (B)  If the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership or a shareholder of
  a New York S corporation, then the credit cap  imposed  in  subparagraph
  (A)  of this paragraph shall be applied at the entity level, so that the
  aggregate credit allowed to all the partners  or  shareholders  of  each
  such  entity  in the taxable year does not exceed the credit cap that is
  applicable in that taxable year.
    (2) Tax credits allowed pursuant to this subsection shall  be  allowed
  in  the  taxable  year  that  the  qualified rehabilitation is placed in
  service under section 167 of the federal internal revenue code.
    (3) If the taxpayer is allowed a credit pursuant to section 47 of  the
  internal revenue code with respect to a qualified rehabilitation that is
  also  the  subject  of  the  credit  allowed by this subsection and that
  credit pursuant to such section 47 is recaptured pursuant to  subsection
  (a)  of section 50 of the internal revenue code, a portion of the credit
  allowed under this subsection must be added back  in  the  same  taxable
  year and in the same proportion as the federal recapture.
    (4)  If the amount of the credit allowed under this subsection for any
  taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year,  the  excess
  shall  be treated as an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded in
  accordance with the provisions of section six hundred eighty-six of this
  article, provided, however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.
    (5)  Except  in  the  case  of  a  qualified  rehabilitation   project
  undertaken within a state park, state historic site, or other land owned
  by  the  state,  that  is under the jurisdiction of the office of parks,
  recreation and historic preservation, to  be  eligible  for  the  credit
  allowable  under  this subsection the rehabilitation project shall be in
  whole or in part located within a census tract which  is  identified  as
  being  at or below one hundred percent of the state median family income
  as calculated as of April first of each year using the most recent  five
  year estimate from the American community survey published by the United
  States  Census bureau. If there is a change in the most recent five year
  estimate, a census tract  that  qualified  for  eligibility  under  this
  program  before  information  about  the change was released will remain
  eligible for a credit  under  this  subsection  for  an  additional  two
  calendar years.
    (6)  For  purposes  of  this subsection the term "small project" means
  qualified rehabilitation expenditures totaling two million five  hundred
  thousand dollars or less.


   (pp)  Historic  homeownership  rehabilitation  credit. (1) For taxable
  years beginning on  or  after  January  first,  two  thousand  seven,  a
  taxpayer  shall  be  allowed  a  credit,  to  be computed as hereinafter
  provided, against the tax imposed by this article.  The  amount  of  the
  credit  shall be equal to twenty percent of the qualified rehabilitation
  expenditures made by the taxpayer with respect to a  qualified  historic
  home  and  may  be  allowed  in  the  taxable  year  in  which the final
  certification step of the certified rehabilitation is completed.
    (A) If such expenditures relate only  to  exterior  work,  the  credit
  shall  be  allowed  for  qualified  rehabilitation  expenditures  if the
  exterior  work  has  been  approved  by  a  local  landmark   commission
  established  pursuant to section ninety-six-a or one hundred nineteen-dd
  of the general municipal law or by the office of parks,  recreation  and
  historic preservation.
    (B)  If  such  expenditures relate to both exterior and interior work,
  the credit shall be allowed for  qualified  rehabilitation  expenditures
  that  have been approved by the office of parks, recreation and historic
  preservation or by a local  government  certified  pursuant  to  section
  101(c)(1)   of  the  national  historic  preservation  act.  Under  this
  subparagraph, approval is necessary  for  the  qualified  rehabilitation
  expenditures related to both the exterior work on the qualified historic
  home  and interior work affecting primary significant historic spaces of
  the qualified historic home.
    (2) (A) With respect to any particular residence of  a  taxpayer,  the
  credit  allowed  under paragraph one of this subsection shall not exceed
  fifty thousand dollars for taxable years beginning on or  after  January
  first,   two  thousand  ten  and  before  January  first,  two  thousand
  twenty-five and twenty-five thousand dollars for taxable years beginning
  on or after January first, two thousand twenty-five. In the  case  of  a
  husband and wife, the amount of the credit shall be divided between them
  equally  or  in  such other manner as they may both elect. If a taxpayer
  incurs qualified rehabilitation expenditures in relation  to  more  than
  one residence in the same year, the total amount of credit allowed under
  paragraph  one  of  this  subsection for all such expenditures shall not
  exceed fifty thousand dollars for taxable years beginning  on  or  after
  January  first,  two thousand ten and before January first, two thousand
  twenty-five and twenty-five thousand dollars for taxable years beginning
  on or after January first, two thousand twenty-five.
    (B) For taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after  January  first,  two
  thousand  ten and before January first, two thousand twenty-five, if the
  amount of credit  allowable  under  this  subsection  shall  exceed  the
  taxpayer's tax for such year, and the taxpayer's New York adjusted gross
  income  for such year does not exceed sixty thousand dollars, the excess
  shall be treated as an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded  in
  accordance with the provisions of section six hundred eighty-six of this
  article,  provided,  however, that no interest shall be paid thereon. If
  the taxpayer's New York adjusted gross  income  for  such  year  exceeds
  sixty  thousand  dollars,  the excess credit that may be carried over to
  the following year or years and may be deducted from the taxpayer's  tax
  for  such year or years. For taxable years beginning on or after January
  first, two thousand twenty-five, if the amount of credit allowable under
  this subsection shall exceed the  taxpayer's  tax  for  such  year,  the
  excess  may  be  carried  over to the following year or years and may be
  deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years.

  purposes of this subsection, any amount properly chargeable to a capital
  account:


   (i)  in  connection  with  the certified rehabilitation of a qualified
  historic home, and
    (ii)  for  property  for  which  depreciation would be allowable under
  section 168 of the internal revenue code if the qualified historic  home
  were used in a trade or business.
    (B) Such term shall not include (i) the cost of acquiring any building
  or   interest   therein,   (ii)  any  expenditure  attributable  to  the
  enlargement of an existing building, or (iii) any expenditure made prior
  to January first, two thousand seven.
    (C) Such term shall not include any expenditure in connection with the
  rehabilitation of a qualified historic home unless at least five percent
  of the  total  expenditures  made  in  the  rehabilitation  process  are
  allocable to the rehabilitation of the exterior of such building.
    (D)  If  only  a  portion  of a building is used as a residence of the
  taxpayer, only qualified rehabilitation expenditures which are  properly
  allocable  to such residential portion shall be taken into account under
  this subsection.
    (4)(A) The term "certified rehabilitation" means, for purposes of this
  subsection, any rehabilitation of a certified historic  structure  which
  has  been  approved and certified as being consistent with the standards
  established by  the  commissioner  of  parks,  recreation  and  historic
  preservation  for  rehabilitation by the office of parks, recreation and
  historic preservation, a local government certified pursuant to  section
  101(c)(1)  of the national historic preservation act or a local landmark
  commission established pursuant to section ninety-six-a or  one  hundred

  of the term "certified historic structure";
    (ii) a second certification,  to  be  issued  prior  to  construction,
  certifying  that  the  proposed  rehabilitation  work is consistent with
  standards established by  the  commissioner  of  parks,  recreation  and
  historic preservation for rehabilitation; and
    (iii)  a  final  certification  issued when construction is completed,
  certifying that the work was completed as proposed and  that  the  costs
  are  consistent  with the work completed. Such final certification shall
  be  acceptable  as  proof  that  the  expenditures   related   to   such
  construction   qualify  as  qualified  rehabilitation  expenditures  for
  purposes of the credit allowed under either subparagraph (A) or  (B)  of
  paragraph one of this subsection.
    (5)(A)  The term "qualified historic home" means, for purposes of this
  subsection, a certified  historic  structure  located  within  New  York
  state:
    (i) which has been substantially rehabilitated,
    (ii)  which,  or  any portion of which, is owned, in whole or part, by
  the taxpayer,

    (iv) (1) which is in whole or in part a targeted area residence within
  the  meaning  of  section 143(j) of the internal revenue code; or (2) is
  located within a census tract which is identified as being at  or  below
  one hundred percent of the state median family income in the most recent
  federal  census;  or (3) which is located in a city with a population of
  less than one million with a poverty rate greater than fifteen  percent,
  rounded  to  the  nearest  whole  number,  in  the most recent five year
  estimate from the American community  survey  published  by  the  United
  States census bureau.


   (B)  A  building  shall  be  treated  as  having  been  "substantially
  rehabilitated" if the qualified rehabilitation expenditures in  relation
  to such building total five thousand dollars or more.
    (6)  The  term  "certified  historic structure" means, for purposes of
  this subsection, any building (and its structural components) which:
    (i) is listed in the state or national register of historic places, or
    (ii) is located in a state or national  registered  historic  district
  and is certified as being of historic significance to the district.
    (7)  If  the  taxpayer  holds  stock  as  a  tenant-shareholder  in  a
  cooperative housing corporation,  such  taxpayer  shall  be  treated  as
  owning  the  house or apartment which the taxpayer is entitled to occupy
  as such shareholder.
    (8)(A)  A  percentage  of  the  total   expenditures   made   in   the
  rehabilitation  of  the exterior of a building containing cooperative or
  condominium dwelling units shall be attributed to each such unit  within
  the  building  based  on the percentage of space each such unit occupies
  within the building.
    (B) In the case of a building where less than the entire  building  is
  used  as  a  residence  of  the  taxpayer, only the portion of the total
  expenditures  made  in  the  rehabilitation  of  the  building  that  is
  attributable  to  the  residence  of  the  taxpayer  shall be treated as
  qualified  rehabilitation  expenditures  for  the   purposes   of   this
  subsection.
    (C)  In  the case of a building that is owned by and is a residence of
  two or more persons, other than a husband and wife, the portion  of  the
  total  expenditures  made  in the rehabilitation of the building that is
  attributable to each taxpayer shall be equal to the taxpayer's share  of
  ownership in such building.
    (9) In the case of a building other than a building to which paragraph

  of paragraph four of this subsection.

  taxpayer  shall  be treated as having made, on the date of purchase, the
  qualified rehabilitation expenditures made by the seller of  such  home.
  For  purposes  of this subsection, expenditures made by the seller shall
  be deemed qualified rehabilitation expenditures if such expenditures, if
  made by the purchaser, would have so qualified.
    (B) The term "purchased qualified historic home" means  any  qualified
  historic home purchased by the taxpayer if:
    (i) the taxpayer is the first purchaser of such home after the date of
  the  final certification referred to in clause (iii) of subparagraph (B)
  of paragraph four of this subsection, and  the  purchase  occurs  within
  five years after such date,

  allowed a credit under this subsection, resides in such home,
    (iii) no credit was allowed to the seller under this  subsection  with

    (iv)   the   taxpayer  is  furnished  with  such  information  as  the
  commissioner determines is necessary to determine any credit under  this
  subsection.

  by the taxpayer, the taxpayer disposes of such  taxpayer's  interest  in
  such  building, or such building ceases to be used as a residence of the


 taxpayer, the taxpayer's tax imposed by this  article  for  the  taxable
  year in which such disposition or cessation occurs shall be increased by
  the  recapture  portion  of the credit allowed under this subsection for
  all prior taxable years with respect to such rehabilitation.
    (B)  For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the recapture
  portion shall be the product of the amount  of  credit  claimed  by  the
  taxpayer  multiplied  by  a  ratio,  the  numerator of which is equal to
  twenty-four less the number of  months  the  building  is  used  as  the
  taxpayer's residence and the denominator of which is twenty-four.
    (12) Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to impose
  a  duty upon a local landmark commission established pursuant to section

  a  local  government  certified  pursuant  to  section  101(c)(1) of the
  national historic preservation act to undertake any review  or  approval
  of  an  application  for  the  certification  of  the  rehabilitation of

    * (tt) New York youth jobs program tax credit.   (1) A  taxpayer  that
  has  been certified by the commissioner of labor as a qualified employer
  pursuant to section twenty-five-a of  the  labor  law  and  received  an
  annual  final  certificate of tax credit from such commissioner shall be
  allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this article  equal  to  the
  amount  listed  on  the annual final certificate of tax credit issued by
  the commissioner of labor pursuant to section twenty-five-a of the labor
  law. A taxpayer that is a partner in a partnership, member of a  limited
  liability  company  or shareholder in an S corporation that has received
  its annual final certificate of tax  credit  from  the  commissioner  of
  labor  as  a qualified employer pursuant to section twenty-five-a of the
  labor law shall be allowed its pro rata share of the  credit  earned  by
  the  partnership,  limited  liability  company  or S corporation. If the
  qualified employer's taxable year is a calendar year, the employer shall
  be entitled to claim the  credit  as  calculated  on  the  annual  final
  certificate  of  tax  credit  on  the calendar year return for which the
  annual final certificate of tax credit was issued.    If  the  qualified
  employer's taxable year is a fiscal year, the employer shall be entitled
  to claim the credit as calculated on the annual final certificate of tax
  credit  on  the  return for the fiscal year that encompasses the date on
  which the annual final certificate of tax  credit  is  issued.  For  the

  the  same  meaning  as  set  forth  in  subdivision   (b)   of   section
  twenty-five-a of the labor law.
    (2)  If the amount of the credit allowed under this subsection exceeds

  deductible in that taxable year will be treated as an overpayment of tax
  to  be credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of section
  six hundred eighty-six of this article. Provided, however,  no  interest
  will be paid thereon.
    (3)  The  taxpayer  shall  be required to attach to its tax return its

  shall the taxpayer be allowed a credit greater than the  amount  of  the

 addresses of any taxpayer claiming this credit and  the  amount  of  the

  this credit because it is a member of a  limited  liability  company,  a

  corporation, only the amount of credit earned by the entity and not  the

  year, must (a) be a resident, (b) claim one or more  dependent  children
  who were under the age of seventeen on the last day of the taxable year,

  dollars but no greater than three hundred thousand dollars, and (d) have
  a tax liability as determined under paragraph three of  this  subsection

    3.  For purposes of this subsection, tax liability shall be determined
  by applying the tax rate calculations in sections six  hundred  one  and
  six hundred one-a of this part to the taxpayer's taxable income and then
  subtracting  from  that  amount any other tax credits allowed under this
  section or section six hundred twenty of this article.

    (xx) Real property tax credit for manufacturers.  (1) A qualified  New
  York  manufacturer  will  be allowed a credit equal to twenty percent of
  the real property tax it paid during the taxable year for real  property
  owned by such manufacturer in New York which was principally used during
  the  taxable  year  for  manufacturing  to  the  extent  not deducted in
  computing New York adjusted  gross  income.  This  credit  will  not  be
  allowed  if  the  real property taxes that are the basis for this credit
  are included in  the  calculation  of  another  credit  claimed  by  the
  taxpayer.
    (2)(A)  The  term qualified New York manufacturer has the same meaning
  as under subparagraph (vi)  of  paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  one  of
  section two hundred ten of this chapter.
    (B)  (i)  The  term real property tax means a charge imposed upon real
  property by or on behalf of a county,  city,  town,  village  or  school
  district  for  municipal  or school district purposes, provided that the
  charge is levied for the general public welfare  by  the  proper  taxing
  authorities  at  a  like  rate  against  all  property  over  which such
  authorities have jurisdiction, and provided that where taxes are  levied
  pursuant  to  article eighteen or nineteen of the real property tax law,
  the property must have been taxed at the rate determined for  the  class
  in  which  it  is  contained,  as  provided  by such article eighteen or
  nineteen, whichever is applicable. The term real property tax  does  not
  include  a  charge  for  local  benefits,  including any portion of that
  charge  that  is  properly  allocated  to  the  costs  attributable   to


 maintenance  or interest, when (I) the property subject to the charge is
  limited to the property that benefits  from  the  charge,  or  (II)  the
  amount  of  the  charge  is  determined  by  the benefit to the property
  assessed,  or  (III)  the  improvement  for which the charge is assessed
  tends to increase the property value.
    (ii) In addition, the term real property tax includes  taxes  paid  by
  the taxpayer upon real property principally used during the taxable year
  by  the  taxpayer  in  manufacturing where the taxpayer leases such real
  property from an unrelated third party if the following  conditions  are
  satisfied:  (I)  the tax must be paid by the taxpayer as lessee pursuant
  to explicit requirements in a written lease, and (II)  the  taxpayer  as
  lessee  has  paid  such  taxes  directly to the taxing authority and has
  received a  written  receipt  for  payment  of  taxes  from  the  taxing
  authority.  In  the case of a taxpayer that, during the taxable year, is
  principally engaged in the production of goods by farming,  agriculture,
  horticulture,  floriculture,  viticulture,  or  commercial  fishing, the
  taxpayer is eligible if the taxpayer satisfies  the  conditions  in  the
  preceding  sentence  and  the  taxpayer leases such real property from a
  related or unrelated party.
    (iii) The term real property tax does not include a  payment  made  by
  the  taxpayer in connection with an agreement for the payment in lieu of
  taxes on real property, whether such property is owned or leased by  the
  taxpayer.
    (iv)  The real property taxes must be paid by the taxpayer in the year
  such taxes become a lien on the real property.
    (3) Credit recapture. Where a qualified New York  manufacturer's  real
  property  taxes  which  were  the  basis for the allowance of the credit
  provided for under this subdivision are subsequently reduced as a result
  of a final order in any proceeding  under  article  seven  of  the  real
  property tax law or other provision of law, the taxpayer shall add back,
  in  the  taxable year in which such final order is issued, the excess of
  (i) the amount of credit originally allowed for a taxable year over (ii)
  the amount of credit determined based upon  the  reduced  real  property
  taxes. If such final order reduces real property taxes for more than one
  year,  the  taxpayer  must  determine  how  much  of  such  reduction is
  attributable to each year covered by such final order and calculate  the
  amount  of credit which is required by this subdivision to be recaptured
  for each year based on such reduction.
    (4) If the amount of the credit allowed under this subsection for  any
  taxable  year  exceeds the taxpayer's tax for such year, the excess will
  be treated as an overpayment to be credited or  refunded  in  accordance
  with  the  provisions of section six hundred eighty-six of this article,
  provided however, no interest will be paid thereon.
    (yy) The tax-free NY area excise  tax  on  telecommunication  services
  credit.  A  taxpayer  that  is a business or owner of a business that is
  located in a tax-free NY area approved pursuant to article twenty-one of
  the economic development law shall be allowed  a  credit  equal  to  the
  excise  tax on telecommunication services imposed by section one hundred
  eighty-six-e of this chapter and passed through to such business  during
  the  taxable  year to the extent not otherwise deducted in computing New
  York adjusted gross income. This credit may be claimed  only  where  any
  tax imposed by such section one hundred eighty-six-e has been separately
  stated  on  a  bill  from the provider of telecommunication services and
  paid by such taxpayer with respect to such services  rendered  within  a
  tax-free  NY  area  during the taxable year. If the amount of the credit
  allowed  under  this  subsection  for  any  taxable  year  exceeds   the
  taxpayer's  tax  for  such  year,  the  excess  will  be  treated  as an
  overpayment to be credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions


 of section six hundred eighty-six of this  article,  provided,  however,
  that no interest will be paid thereon.
    (zz)  Workers  with disabilities tax credit. (1) A qualified employer,
  as defined in paragraph one of subdivision (b) of section  twenty-five-b
  of  the labor law, shall be entitled to a credit against the tax imposed
  by this article. The amount of the credit shall be: fifteen  percent  of
  the  qualified wages paid after January first, two thousand fifteen to a
  qualified full-time employee who is  employed  for  not  less  than  six
  months  and  who  works at least thirty hours per week; and shall be ten
  percent of the qualified wages paid after January  first,  two  thousand
  fifteen  to  a qualified part-time employee who is employed for not less
  than six months and works at least eight  hours  per  week.  The  credit
  allowed pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed, during any taxable
  year, five thousand dollars for any qualified full time employee and two
  thousand  five  hundred  dollars  for  any qualified part time employee.
  "Qualified wages" means wages paid or incurred by the qualified employer
  during the taxable year to a qualified employee which are  attributable,
  with  respect  to  such  employee, to services rendered by the qualified
  employee.
    (2) If the amount of credit allowable under this  subsection  for  any
  taxable  year  shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year, any amount
  of credit not deductible in such taxable year may be carried over to the
  following three years, and may be deducted for the qualified  employer's
  tax for such years.
    (3)  The taxpayer shall attach to its tax return its final certificate
  of eligibility issued by the commissioner of labor pursuant  to  section
  twenty-five-b  of  the  labor  law.  In  no  event shall the taxpayer be
  allowed a credit greater than the amount of the  credit  listed  on  the
  final  certificate of eligibility. Notwithstanding any provision of this
  chapter  to  the  contrary,  the  commissioner  and  the  commissioner's
  designees  may  release the names and addresses of any taxpayer claiming
  this credit and the amount of the credit earned by the taxpayer.
    (4) A qualified employer may not claim the workers  with  disabilities
  tax  credit  if  it  claims  any  of the other credits for employment of
  persons with disabilities under either subsection  (o)  of  section  six
  hundred  six,  subdivision  twelve  of  section  two  hundred  ten-B, or
  subdivision (j) of section fifteen hundred eleven of this chapter.
    (aaa) Minimum wage reimbursement  credit.  (1)  A  taxpayer  shall  be
  allowed  a credit, to be computed as provided in section thirty-eight of
  this chapter, against the tax imposed by this article.
    (2) Application of credit. If the amount of the credit  allowed  under
  this subsection for any taxable year exceeds the taxpayer's tax for such
  year, the excess will be treated as an overpayment of tax to be credited
  or  refunded  in  accordance  with the provisions of section six hundred
  eighty-six of this article, provided, however, that no interest will  be
  paid thereon.
    (ccc)  Article  twenty-four  employee credit. A covered employee of an
  electing employer shall be entitled to a credit against the tax  imposed
  by  this  article  as  provided in this subsection. For purposes of this
  subsection the terms "covered employee" and  "electing  employer"  shall
  have  the  same  meanings  as  under section eight hundred fifty of this
  chapter. (1) For two thousand nineteen, the credit shall be equal to the
  product of (i) the covered employee's wages and compensation  in  excess
  of forty thousand dollars received during the tax year from the electing
  employer  that  are  subject  to tax under this article and (ii) one and
  one-half percent and (iii) the result  of  one  minus  a  fraction,  the
  numerator  of  which shall be the tax imposed on the covered employee as
  determined pursuant to section six hundred one of  this  article  before


 the  application  of  any  credits  for  the applicable tax year and the
  denominator of which shall be the covered employee's taxable  income  as
  determined pursuant to this article for the applicable tax year. (2) For
  two thousand twenty, the credit shall be equal to the product of (i) the
  covered  employee's  wages  and compensation in excess of forty thousand
  dollars received during the tax year from the electing employer that are
  subject to tax under this article and (ii) three percent and  (iii)  the
  result  of one minus a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the tax
  imposed on the covered employee as determined pursuant  to  section  six
  hundred  one  of  this article before the application of any credits for
  the applicable tax year and  the  denominator  of  which  shall  be  the
  covered employee's taxable income as determined pursuant to this article
  for  the  applicable  tax  year.  (3)  For  two  thousand twenty-one and
  thereafter, the credit shall be equal to the product of (i) the  covered
  employee's  wages  and  compensation in excess of forty thousand dollars
  received during the tax year from the electing employer that are subject
  to tax under this article and (ii) five percent and (iii) the result  of
  one minus a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the tax imposed on
  the  covered  employee as determined pursuant to section six hundred one
  of this article before the application of any credits for the applicable
  tax year and the denominator of which shall be  the  covered  employee's
  taxable income as determined pursuant to this article for the applicable
  tax  year.  If  the amount of the credit allowable under this subsection
  for any taxable year shall exceed the taxpayer's tax for such year,  the
  excess  allowed  for a taxable year may be carried over to the following
  year or years and may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such  year
  or years.
    (ddd)  Employee  training incentive program tax credit. (1) A taxpayer
  that has been approved by the commissioner of  economic  development  to
  participate  in  the  employee  training  incentive program and has been
  issued a certificate of tax credit  pursuant  to  section  four  hundred
  forty-three  of the economic development law shall be allowed to claim a
  credit against the tax imposed by this article. The credit  shall  equal
  fifty percent of a taxpayer's eligible training costs, up to a credit of
  ten  thousand dollars per employee completing eligible training pursuant
  to paragraph (a) of subdivision three of section four hundred  forty-one
  of the economic development law. The credit shall equal fifty percent of
  the  stipend paid to an intern, up to a credit of three thousand dollars
  per intern completing eligible training pursuant  to  paragraph  (b)  of
  subdivision  three  of  section  four  hundred forty-one of the economic
  development law. In no event  shall  a  taxpayer  be  allowed  a  credit
  greater  than  the amount listed on the certificate of tax credit issued
  by the commissioner of economic development. In the case of  a  taxpayer
  who is a partner in a partnership, member of a limited liability company
  or  shareholder  in  an S corporation, the taxpayer shall be allowed its
  pro rata  share  of  the  credit  earned  by  the  partnership,  limited
  liability  company  or  S corporation. The credit will be allowed in the
  taxable year in which the eligible training is completed.
    (2) If the amount of the credit allowed under this subsection for  any
  taxable year exceeds the taxpayer's tax for the taxable year, the excess
  shall  be treated as an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded in
  accordance with the provisions of section six hundred eighty-six of this
  article, provided, however, no interest will be paid thereon.

  maintained  his  or  her  primary  residence  in  this state on December
  thirty-first of the taxable year, and who was an owner of that  property


 on  that  date, provided however: (i) A taxpayer whose primary residence
  received a STAR exemption for the associated fiscal year  shall  not  be
  considered a qualified taxpayer for purposes of this subsection.
    (ii) An individual may be considered a qualified taxpayer with respect
  to no more than one primary residence during any given taxable year.
    (iii) If a resident individual was an owner of the property during the
  taxable  year but did not own it on December thirty-first of the taxable
  year, he or she shall be considered a qualified taxpayer if the property
  was his or her primary residence during the taxable year and he  or  she
  paid  qualifying  taxes  on  that  property while he or she was still an
  owner of that property.
    (iv) If a resident  individual  has  acquired  ownership  of  property
  during  a taxable year, such resident individual shall not be considered
  a qualified taxpayer for that taxable year to the extent that an advance
  payment of the credit for that taxable year has been issued to the prior
  owner with respect to the same property, unless such resident individual
  can demonstrate that he or she paid qualifying taxes  on  such  property
  during the taxable year, and that the prior owner did not.
    (B)  "Affiliated  income"  shall  mean  for purposes of the basic STAR
  credit, the combined income of all of  the  owners  of  the  parcel  who
  resided  primarily  thereon  as  of December thirty-first of the taxable
  year, and of any owners' spouses residing primarily thereon as  of  such
  date,  and for purposes of the enhanced STAR credit, the combined income
  of all of the owners of the parcel as of December  thirty-first  of  the

  reported for federal income tax purposes, or that would be  reported  as
  adjusted gross income if a federal income tax return were required to be
  filed,  reduced  by  distributions,  to  the  extent included in federal
  adjusted gross income, received from an  individual  retirement  account
  and an individual retirement annuity. For taxable years beginning on and

  determination is wholly or partly based upon the income of one  or  more
  individuals  who  did  not file a return pursuant to section six hundred
  fifty-one of this article for the applicable income tax  year,  then  in
  order  to be eligible for the credit authorized by this subsection, each
  such individual must file a statement with the  department  showing  the
  source or sources of his or her income for that income tax year, and the
  amount  or  amounts  thereof,  that  would  have been reported on such a
  return if one had been filed. Such statement  shall  be  filed  at  such
  time,  and  in  such  form  and  manner,  as  may  be  prescribed by the
  department, and shall be  subject  to  the  provisions  of  section  six
  hundred  ninety-seven  of  this article to the same extent that a return
  would  be.  The  department  shall  make  such  forms  and  instructions
  available  for  the  filing of such statements. The local assessor shall
  upon the request of a taxpayer assist such taxpayer in the filing of the
  statement with the department. Provided further, that if  the  qualified
  taxpayer  was  an  owner of the property during the taxable year but did
  not own it on December  thirty-first  of  the  taxable  year,  then  the
  determination  as  to  whether  the  income  of  an individual should be
  included in "affiliated income" shall be based upon the ownership and/or
  residency status of that individual as of the first  day  of  the  month
  during  which  the  qualified  taxpayer  ceased  to  be  an owner of the
  property, rather than as of December thirty-first of the taxable year.
    (C) "Associated fiscal year" means the  school  district  fiscal  year
  that  began  on July first of the taxable year or, in the case of a city


 school district that is subject to article fifty-two  of  the  education

    (iv) a beneficial owner under a trust,
    (v) a tenant-stockholder of a cooperative  apartment  corporation  who
  resides  in  a  portion  of  real  property  owned  by  such cooperative
  apartment corporation, to the extent represented by his or her share  or
  shares  of  stock  in  such  corporation  as  determined by its or their
  proportional  relationship  to  the  total  outstanding  stock  of   the
  corporation, including that owned by the corporation,
    (vi)  a  resident  of  a  farm  dwelling  that  is  owned  either by a
  corporation of which the resident is a  shareholder,  a  partnership  of
  which  the  resident  is a partner, or by a limited liability company of
  which the resident is an owner, or
    (vii) a resident of a dwelling, other than a farm  dwelling,  that  is
  owned  by  a  limited  partnership  of  which the resident is a partner,
  provided that the limited partnership that holds title to  the  property
  does not engage in any commercial activity, that the limited partnership
  was  lawfully created to hold title solely for estate planning and asset
  protection purposes, and that the  partner  or  partners  who  primarily
  reside  thereon  personally pay all of the real property taxes and other
  costs associated with the property's ownership.
    (E) "Qualifying taxes" means  the  school  district  taxes  that  were
  levied  upon  the taxpayer's primary residence for the associated fiscal
  year that were actually paid by the taxpayer during  the  taxable  year;
  or,  in  the  case  of a city school district that is subject to article
  fifty-two of the education law, the combined city  and  school  district
  taxes  that  were  levied  upon the taxpayer's primary residence for the
  associated fiscal year that were actually paid by  the  taxpayer  during
  the  taxable  year. Provided, however, that in the case of a cooperative
  apartment, "qualifying taxes" means the school district taxes that would
  have been levied upon the tenant-stockholder's primary residence  if  it
  were separately assessed, as determined by the commissioner based on the
  statement  provided  by  the  assessor  pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of
  paragraph (k) of subdivision two of section four hundred twenty-five  of
  the  real  property  tax  law, or in the case of a cooperative apartment
  corporation that is described in subparagraph (iv) of paragraph  (k)  of
  subdivision two of section four hundred twenty-five of the real property
  tax law, one third of such amount. In no case shall the term "qualifying
  taxes" be construed to include penalties or interest.
    (F)  "STAR  exemption"  means  the  school tax relief (STAR) exemption
  authorized by section four hundred twenty-five of the real property  tax
  law.
    (G)  "STAR tax savings" means the tax savings attributable to the STAR
  exemption within a portion of a school district, as  determined  by  the
  commissioner  pursuant  to  subdivision  two of section thirteen hundred
  six-a of the real property tax law for purposes of the credit authorized
  by this subsection.
    (2) Allowance of credit. A  qualified  taxpayer  shall  be  allowed  a
  credit  as  provided  in  paragraph  three  or  four of this subsection,
  whichever is applicable, against  the  taxes  imposed  by  this  article
  reduced  by  the  credits  permitted  by this article, provided that the
  requirements set forth in the applicable subsection  are  satisfied.  If
  the  credit  exceeds  the  tax  as  so  reduced for such year under this


 article, the excess shall be treated as an overpayment, to  be  credited
  or  refunded,  without interest. If a qualified taxpayer is not required
  to file a return pursuant to  section  six  hundred  fifty-one  of  this
  article,  a  qualified taxpayer may nevertheless receive the full amount
  of the credit to be  credited  or  repaid  as  an  overpayment,  without
  interest.
    (3)  Determination  of  basic STAR credit.  (A) Beginning with taxable
  years after two thousand fifteen, a basic STAR credit shall be available
  to a qualified taxpayer if the affiliated  income  of  the  parcel  that
  serves as the taxpayer's primary residence is less than or equal to five
  hundred thousand dollars for the applicable income tax year specified by
  paragraph (b-1) of subdivision three of section four hundred twenty-five
  of the real property tax law. The income limit established for the basic
  STAR  exemption  by paragraph (b-1) of subdivision three of section four
  hundred twenty-five of the real property tax law shall not be taken into
  account when determining eligibility for the basic STAR credit.
    (B) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (C) of  this  paragraph,
  such basic STAR credit shall be the lesser of:
    (i)  the  basic  STAR  tax  savings for the school district portion in
  which the taxpayer's primary residence is located, or
    (ii) the taxpayer's qualifying taxes.
    (C) If the qualifying taxes paid by the taxpayer  constituted  only  a
  portion  of  the  total  school district taxes that were levied upon the
  taxpayer's primary residence for the associated fiscal year or,  in  the
  case  of  a city school district that is subject to article fifty-two of
  the education  law,  if  the  qualifying  taxes  paid  by  the  taxpayer
  constituted  only  a  portion  of  the  total  combined  city and school
  district taxes that were levied upon the  taxpayer's  primary  residence
  for  the  associated  fiscal year, the credit allowable to such taxpayer
  shall be equal to the amount determined pursuant to subparagraph (B)  of
  this   paragraph   multiplied   by  the  percentage  that  such  portion
  represents.
    (4) Determination of enhanced STAR credit. (A) Beginning with  taxable
  years  after  two  thousand  fifteen,  an  enhanced STAR credit shall be
  available to a qualified taxpayer where both of the following conditions
  are satisfied:
    (i) All of the owners of the parcel  that  serves  as  the  taxpayer's
  primary  residence  are  at least sixty-five years of age as of December
  thirty-first of the taxable year or, in the case of property owned by  a
  married  couple  or  by siblings, at least one of the owners is at least
  sixty-five years of age as of that date. The terms  "siblings"  as  used
  herein  shall have the same meaning as set forth in section four hundred
  sixty-seven of the real property tax law. In the case of property  owned
  by a married couple, one of whom is sixty-five years of age or over, the
  credit,  once  allowed,  shall not be disallowed because of the death of
  the older spouse so long as the surviving spouse is at  least  sixty-two
  years of age as of December thirty-first of the taxable year.
    (ii) The affiliated income of the parcel that serves as the taxpayer's
  primary  residence  is less than or equal to the income standard for the
  taxable year established  by  the  commissioner  for  the  corresponding
  "income  tax  year"  pursuant  to  clause  (C)  of  subparagraph  (i) of
  paragraph (b) of subdivision four of section four hundred twenty-five of
  the real property tax law for purposes of the enhanced STAR exemption.
    (B) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (C) of  this  paragraph,
  such credit shall be the lesser of:
    (i)  the  enhanced STAR tax savings for the school district portion in
  which the taxpayer's primary residence is located, or
    (ii) the taxpayer's qualifying taxes.


   (C) If the qualifying taxes paid by the taxpayer  constituted  only  a
  portion  of  the  total  school district taxes that were levied upon the
  taxpayer's primary residence for the associated fiscal year or,  in  the
  case  of  a city school district that is subject to article fifty-two of
  the  education  law,  if  the  qualifying  taxes  paid  by  the taxpayer
  constituted only a  portion  of  the  total  combined  city  and  school
  district  taxes  that  were levied upon the taxpayer's primary residence
  for the associated fiscal year, the credit allowable  to  such  taxpayer
  shall  be equal to the amount determined pursuant to subparagraph (B) of
  this  paragraph  multiplied  by  the  percentage   that   such   portion
  represents.
    (5)  Disqualification.  A  taxpayer  shall  not qualify for the credit
  authorized  by  this  subsection  if  the  parcel  that  serves  as  the
  taxpayer's   primary  residence  received  the  STAR  exemption  on  the
  assessment roll upon which school  district  taxes  for  the  associated
  fiscal year were levied. Provided, however, that the taxpayer may remove
  this  disqualification by switching to the credit in the manner provided
  by subdivision seventeen of section four hundred twenty-five of the real
  property  tax  law.  Alternatively,  the  taxpayer   may   remove   this
  disqualification  by  renouncing  the  exemption and making any required
  payments in the manner provided by section four  hundred  ninety-six  of
  the real property tax law. Any such switch to the credit or renunciation
  shall be irrevocable.
    (6) Special cases.
    (A)  A  married  couple  may  not  receive  a  credit pursuant to this
  subsection on more than one residence during  any  given  taxable  year,
  unless  living  apart  due to legal separation. Nor may a married couple
  receive a credit pursuant to this  subsection  on  one  residence  while
  receiving  an  exemption pursuant to section four hundred twenty-five of
  the real property tax law on another residence, unless living apart  due
  to legal separation.
    (B)  (i)  In  the case of property consisting of a mobile home that is
  described in paragraph (1) of subdivision two of  section  four  hundred
  twenty-five  of  the  real  property  tax  law, the amount of the credit
  allowable with respect to such mobile home shall be equal to  the  basic
  STAR  tax  savings for the school district portion, or the enhanced STAR
  tax savings for the school district portion,  whichever  is  applicable,
  that  would  be  applied  to  a separately assessed parcel in the school
  district portion with a taxable assessed value equal to twenty  thousand
  dollars  multiplied  by  the  latest  state equalization rate or special
  equalization rate for the assessing unit in which  the  mobile  home  is
  located. Provided, however, that if the commissioner is in possession of
  information,  including  but  not  limited  to  assessment records, that
  demonstrates to the  commissioner's  satisfaction  that  the  taxpayer's
  mobile  home  is  worth  more  than  twenty  thousand dollars, or if the
  taxpayer provides the commissioner with such information, the taxpayer's
  credit shall be increased accordingly, but in no case shall  the  credit
  exceed  the  basic  STAR  tax  savings  or  enhanced  STAR  tax savings,
  whichever is applicable, for the school district portion.
    (ii) The commissioner may  implement  an  electronic  system  for  the
  reporting  of  information  by owners and operators of manufactured home
  parks, as defined by  section  two  hundred  thirty-three  of  the  real
  property  law. Upon the implementation of such a system, each such owner
  and operator shall file  electronic  statements  with  the  commissioner
  according  to  a  schedule  to  be  determined by the commissioner. Such
  statement shall require reporting of names  of  all  persons  owning  an
  interest  in  the  park,  the services provided by the park owner to the
  tenants, the name of the agent designated pursuant to subdivision  l  of


 section two hundred thirty-three of the real property law, the names and
  addresses  of all tenants of the park, whether the tenant leases or owns
  the home, the rent set for each lot in the  park,  and  such  additional
  information  as  the  commissioner  may  deem  necessary  for the proper
  administration of the STAR exemption  established  pursuant  to  section
  four  hundred  twenty-five  of  the  real  property tax law and the STAR
  credit and any other property tax-based credit established  pursuant  to
  this section. In the case of the first registration statement filed in a
  calendar  year,  such statement shall also include a copy of all current
  manufactured home park rules and  regulations.  In  the  case  that  the
  manufactured  home  park  rules  and  regulations are modified after the
  filing of the first registration statement in a calendar year, the  next
  subsequent  registration  statement  shall  also  include a copy of such
  rules and regulations. The commissioner shall provide  the  commissioner
  of  housing and community renewal with the information contained in each
  report no later than thirty days after the receipt thereof.
    (iii) Beginning with the two  thousand  twenty-two  taxable  year,  to
  receive  the  credit authorized by this subsection, an owner of a mobile
  home described by clause (i) of this  subparagraph  shall  register  for
  such credit in the manner prescribed by the commissioner.
    (C)  In the case of a primary residence that is located in two or more
  school districts, the applicable basic or enhanced STAR tax savings  for
  the school district portion shall be determined as follows:
    (i)  determine  the  sum  of the total school district taxes that were
  levied upon the taxpayer's primary residence for the  associated  fiscal
  year by each of the school districts in which the residence is located;
    (ii)  for  each such school district, divide the total school district
  taxes that were levied upon the taxpayer's  primary  residence  by  that
  school  district for the associated fiscal year by the sum determined in
  clause (i) of this subparagraph. Express the result as a percentage with
  two decimal places;
    (iii)  for  each  such  school  district,  multiply   the   percentage
  determined  in clause (ii) of this subparagraph by the basic or enhanced
  STAR  tax  savings  for  the  school  district  portion,  whichever   is
  applicable; and
    (iv) add the products determined in clause (iii) of this subparagraph.
    (7)  Disclosure  of  incomes  and  other  information.  (A)  Where the
  commissioner has denied a taxpayer's claim for the credit authorized  by
  this  subsection  in whole or in part on the grounds that the affiliated
  income of the parcel in  question  exceeds  the  applicable  limit,  the
  commissioner  shall  have  the  authority to reveal to that taxpayer the
  names and incomes of the other taxpayers whose incomes were included  in
  the computation of such affiliated income.
    (B)  Notwithstanding  any  provision of law to the contrary, the names
  and addresses of individuals who have applied for or are  receiving  the
  credit  authorized  by  this  subsection  may be disclosed to assessors,
  county directors of  real  property  tax  services,  and  municipal  tax
  collecting officers within New York state. In addition, such information
  may  be  exchanged  with  assessors and tax officials from jurisdictions
  outside New York state if the laws of the other jurisdiction allow it to
  provide similar information to this state.  Such  information  shall  be
  considered  confidential  and shall not be subject to further disclosure
  pursuant to the freedom of information law or otherwise.
    (8) Proof of claim. The commissioner may require a qualified  taxpayer
  to  furnish the following information in support of his or her claim for
  credit under  this  subsection:  affiliated  income,  the  total  school
  district taxes levied on the property for the associated fiscal year or,
  in  the  case  of  a  city  school  district  that is subject to article


 fifty-two of the education law,  the  total  combined  city  and  school
  district  taxes  levied  on the property for the associated fiscal year,
  the qualifying taxes paid  by  the  taxpayer,  the  names  and  taxpayer
  identification  numbers  of  all  owners of the property and spouses who
  primarily reside on the property, the parcel identification  number  and
  all  other  information  that  may  be  required  by the commissioner to
  determine the credit.
    (9) Returns. Whether or not the taxpayer is required to file a  return
  pursuant  to  section six hundred fifty-one of this article, the process
  for requesting advance payment of such credit shall be  as  provided  by
  paragraph ten of this subsection.
    (10)   Advance  payments.  (A)  The  commissioner  shall  establish  a
  mechanism by which a qualified taxpayer may apply for an advance payment
  of the credit authorized by this section, provided that:
    (i) If the taxpayer acquired a new primary residence  between  January
  first   and  July  first  of  the  taxable  year,  inclusive,  any  such
  application must be submitted to the commissioner by the  first  day  of
  July of the taxable year, or such later date as may be prescribed by the
  commissioner  in  order  for the taxpayer's payment to be subject to the
  processing schedule provided by subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, and
    (ii) A qualified taxpayer who fails to apply for an advance payment of
  such credit by such date may apply for and receive such  credit  in  the
  manner  prescribed  by  the commissioner, provided that such application
  shall be made within three years from the time that  a  return  for  the
  taxable  year would have had to be filed pursuant to section six hundred
  fifty-one of this article. If approved, such payment shall be issued  as
  soon as is practicable after the submission of the application but shall
  not be subject to the processing schedule prescribed by subparagraph (B)
  of this paragraph, and
    (iii)  A  qualified taxpayer who has applied for an advance payment of
  such credit in a taxable year  may  continue  to  receive  such  advance
  payments in future taxable years without reapplying as long as he or she
  remains eligible therefor.
    (B)  On  or  before the date specified below, or as soon thereafter as
  practicable,  the  commissioner  shall  determine  the  eligibility   of
  taxpayers  for this credit utilizing the information available to him or
  her as obtained from the applications submitted on or before July  first
  of  that  year,  or  such  later date as may have been prescribed by the
  commissioner for that purpose,  and  from  such  other  sources  as  the
  commissioner  deems  reliable  and appropriate. For those taxpayers whom
  the  commissioner  has  determined  eligible  for   this   credit,   the
  commissioner  shall  advance  a  payment  in  the  amount  specified  in
  paragraph  three,  four  or  six  of  this  subsection,   whichever   is
  applicable. Such payment shall be issued by the date specified below, or
  as  soon  thereafter as is practicable; provided that if such payment is
  issued after such date, it shall be subject  to  interest  at  the  rate
  prescribed  by  subparagraph  (A)  of paragraph two of subsection (j) of
  section six hundred ninety-seven  of  this  article.  Nothing  contained
  herein  shall  be  deemed  to  preclude  the  commissioner  from issuing
  payments after such date to qualified taxpayers whose applications  were
  made  after July first of that year, or such later date as may have been
  prescribed by the commissioner for such purpose.
    (i) The applicable dates for this purpose are as follows:
    (I) If the school district tax roll is filed with the commissioner  on
  or  before July first, the determination of eligibility shall be made by
  July fifteenth, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, and the advance
  payment shall be issued by July thirtieth, or as soon thereafter  as  is
  practicable.


   (II)  If  the  school district tax roll is filed with the commissioner
  after July first and on or before September first, the determination  of
  eligibility  shall be made by September fifteenth, or as soon thereafter
  as is practicable, and the advance payment shall be issued by  September
  thirtieth, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.
    (III)  If  the school district tax roll is filed with the commissioner
  after September first, the determination of eligibility shall be made by
  the fifteenth day after  such  filing,  or  as  soon  thereafter  as  is
  practicable,  and  the  advance payment shall be issued by the thirtieth
  day after such filing, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph, in
  the case of taxpayers whose primary residence is a cooperative apartment
  or a mobile home that is subject to the provisions of  subparagraph  (A)
  or  (B) of paragraph six of this subsection, the payment shall be issued
  by the sixtieth day following receipt of  all  of  the  data  needed  to
  properly calculate the credit, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.
    (C) A taxpayer who has failed to receive an advance payment that he or
  she  believes  was  due  to  him  or her, or who has received an advance
  payment that he or she believes is less than the amount that was due  to
  him  or  her,  may request payment of the claimed deficiency in a manner
  prescribed by the commissioner.
    (D) An advance payment of credit provided pursuant to this  subsection
  that exceeds the taxpayer's qualifying taxes for that taxable year shall
  be added back as tax on the income tax return for that taxable year.
    (E)  If  the  commissioner determines after issuing an advance payment
  that it was issued in  an  excessive  amount  or  to  an  ineligible  or
  incorrect  party,  the commissioner shall be empowered to utilize any of
  the procedures for collection, levy and lien of personal income tax  set
  forth  in  this article, any other relevant procedures referenced within
  the provisions of this article, and any other law as may be  applicable,
  to  recoup the improperly issued amount; provided that in the event such
  party was determined to be ineligible on  the  basis  that  his  or  her
  primary  residence  received the STAR exemption in the associated fiscal
  year, the improperly issued credit amount shall  be  deemed  a  clerical
  error and shall be paid upon notice and demand without the issuance of a
  notice  of  deficiency  and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the
  same manner as taxes.
    (11) Administration. The provisions of  this  article,  including  the
  provisions of sections six hundred fifty-three, six hundred fifty-eight,
  and  six  hundred  fifty-nine of this article and the provisions of part
  six of this article relating to procedure and administration,  including
  the judicial review of the decisions of the commissioner, except so much
  of section six hundred eighty-seven of this article that permits a claim
  for  credit  or  refund  to  be  filed  after the period provided for in
  paragraph nine of  this  subsection  and  except  sections  six  hundred
  fifty-seven, six hundred eighty-eight and six hundred ninety-six of this
  article,  shall  apply  to the provisions of this subsection in the same
  manner and with the same force and effect as if the  language  of  those
  provisions  had  been  incorporated in full into this subsection and had
  expressly referred to the credit allowed or  returns  filed  under  this
  subsection,  except  to  the  extent  that  any such provision is either
  inconsistent with a provision of this subsection or is not  relevant  to
  this  subsection.  As  used  in  such  sections  and such part, the term
  "taxpayer" shall include a qualified taxpayer under this subsection and,
  notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of section six  hundred
  ninety-seven  of  this article, where a qualified taxpayer has protested
  the denial of a claim for credit under this subsection and the  time  to
  file  a  petition  for redetermination of a deficiency or for refund has


 not expired, he or she shall, subject to such conditions as may  be  set
  by  the  commissioner, receive such information (A) that is contained in
  any return filed under this article by a member of his or her  household
  for  the  taxable year for which the credit is claimed, and (B) that the
  commissioner finds is relevant and material to the issue of whether such
  claim was properly denied.
    (12) When the calculation of any other personal income tax  credit  is
  based  in  whole  or  in  part  upon the real property taxes paid by the
  taxpayer, the amount of real property taxes so paid shall be reduced  by
  the  credit  authorized by this subsection, if applicable, in the course
  of performing such  calculation.  When  the  calculation  of  any  other
  personal  income  tax  credit  is  based  in  whole  or  in part upon an
  individual's  state  tax  liability,  the  credit  authorized  by   this
  subsection  shall  not  be taken into account in the calculation of such
  state tax liability. When the calculation of a  city  tax  surcharge  is
  based  in  whole or in part upon the net state tax of an individual, the
  credit authorized by this subsection shall not be taken into account  in
  the calculation of such net state tax.
    (13)   (A)   Nothing   herein  shall  be  construed  to  preclude  the
  commissioner from making a preliminary advance  payment  of  the  credit
  based  upon  an  estimate of the STAR tax savings applicable to a school
  district portion, where he or she finds that attempting to ascertain the
  actual STAR tax savings applicable to the school district portion  would
  jeopardize  the  timely  issuance  of  the  payment. When making such an
  estimate,  the  commissioner  shall  consider  the  STAR   tax   savings
  applicable  in  the school district fiscal year preceding the associated
  fiscal  year,  the  allowable  levy  growth  factor  applicable  to  the
  calculation  of  the  tax  levy  limit  for  the  associated fiscal year
  pursuant to paragraph a of  subdivision  two  of  section  two  thousand
  twenty-three-a  of  the  education  law,  taxable  assessed  value where
  appropriate, and such other information that in his or her judgment will
  help make the estimate as accurate as possible.
    (B) Nothing herein shall be construed  to  preclude  the  commissioner
  from  making  a  preliminary  advance  payment  of  the  credit  without
  attempting to ascertain the taxpayer's qualifying taxes, where he or she
  finds that attempting to ascertain the taxpayer's qualifying taxes would
  jeopardize the timely issuance of the payment.
    (C)  If  the  commissioner  determines  that  a  taxpayer  received  a
  preliminary  advance  payment that is above or below the advance payment
  to which he or she was entitled under this subsection, the  commissioner
  shall  provide notice to such taxpayer that the next advance payment due
  to such taxpayer under this subsection shall be  adjusted  to  reconcile
  such  underpayment  or  overpayment; provided, however, the commissioner
  shall permit a taxpayer to request that such adjustment be  made  on  an
  originally filed timely income tax return for the tax year in which such
  overpayment  or  underpayment occurred, provided such return is filed on
  or before the due date for such return,  determined  without  regard  to
  extensions.
    (D)  A  taxpayer  who  received  a  preliminary  advance  payment that
  constitutes an overpayment shall not be required to pay interest on  the
  amount of the overpayment.
    (E)  On or after April first, two thousand nineteen, a taxpayer who is
  found to have made a material misstatement on  an  application  for  the
  credit  authorized  by this section shall be disqualified from receiving
  such  credit  for  six  years.  As  used  herein,  the  term   "material
  misstatement"  shall have the same meaning as set forth in paragraph (a)
  of subdivision thirteen of section four hundred twenty-five of the  real
  property tax law.


   (fff) Farm workforce retention credit. (1) A taxpayer shall be allowed
  a  credit,  to  be  computed  as  provided  in section forty-two of this
  chapter, against the tax imposed by this article.
    (2)  Application of credit. If the amount of credit allowed under this
  subsection for any taxable year exceeds  the  taxpayer's  tax  for  such
  year, the excess will be treated as an overpayment of tax to be credited
  or  refunded  in  accordance  with  the provision of section six hundred
  eighty-six of this article, provided, however, that no interest will  be
  paid thereon.
    (ggg)  School  tax  reduction  credit  for  residents of a city with a
  population over one million. (1) For taxable years beginning  after  two
  thousand  fifteen,  a  school tax reduction credit shall be allowed to a
  resident individual of the state who is a resident  of  a  city  with  a
  population  over  one  million,  as  provided below. The credit shall be
  allowed against the taxes authorized by  this  article  reduced  by  the
  credits  permitted  by this article. If the credit exceeds the tax as so
  reduced, the excess shall be treated as an  overpayment  of  tax  to  be
  credited  or  refunded  in accordance with the provisions of section six
  hundred eighty-six of this article, provided however, that  no  interest
  will  be  paid thereon. For purposes of this subsection, no credit shall
  be granted to an individual with  respect  to  whom  a  deduction  under
  subsection  (c) of section one hundred fifty-one of the internal revenue
  code is allowable to another taxpayer for the taxable year.
    (2) The amount of the credit under this subsection shall be determined
  based upon the taxpayer's income as  defined  in  subparagraph  (ii)  of
  paragraph (b) of subdivision four of section four hundred twenty-five of
  the real property tax law.
    (3)  For  taxable  years beginning in two thousand sixteen, the credit
  shall be determined as provided in this paragraph, provided that for the
  purposes of this paragraph, any taxpayer under subparagraphs (A) and (B)
  of this paragraph with income of more than two  hundred  fifty  thousand
  dollars shall not receive a credit.
    (A) Married individuals filing joint returns and surviving spouses. In
  the  case of married individuals who make a single return jointly and of
  a surviving spouse, the credit shall be one hundred twenty-five dollars.
    (B) All others. In the case of an unmarried individual, a  head  of  a
  household  or  a married individual filing a separate return, the credit
  shall be sixty-two dollars and fifty cents.
    (4) For taxable years beginning after two thousand sixteen, the credit
  shall equal the "fixed" amount  provided  by  paragraph  (4-a)  of  this
  subsection  plus the "rate reduction" amount provided by paragraph (4-b)
  of this subsection.
    (4-a) The "fixed" amount of the credit shall be determined as provided
  in this paragraph, provided that any taxpayer with income of  more  than
  two hundred fifty thousand dollars shall not receive such amount.
    (A) Married individuals filing joint returns and surviving spouses. In
  the  case of married individuals who make a single return jointly and of
  a surviving spouse, the "fixed"  amount  of  the  credit  shall  be  one
  hundred twenty-five dollars.
    (B)  All  others.  In the case of an unmarried individual, a head of a
  household or a married individual filing a separate return, the  "fixed"
  amount of the credit shall be sixty-two dollars and fifty cents.
    (4-b) The "rate reduction" amount of the credit shall be determined as
  provided  in  this  paragraph, provided that any taxpayer with income of
  more than five hundred thousand dollars shall not receive such amount.
    (A) For married individuals who make a single return jointly and for a
  surviving spouse:


 If the city taxable income is:         The "rate reduction" amount is:
  Not over $21,600                       0.171% of the city taxable income
  Over $21,600 but not over $500,000     $37 plus 0.228% of excess over
                                           $21,600
  Over $500,000                              Not applicable
    (B) For a head of household:
  If the city taxable income is:         The "rate reduction" amount is:
  Not over $14,400                       0.171% of the city taxable income
  Over $14,400 but not over $500,000     $25 plus 0.228% of excess over
                                           $14,400
  Over $500,000                              Not applicable
    (C) For an unmarried individual or a married individual filing
  a separate return:
  If the city taxable income is:         The "rate reduction" amount is:
  Not over $12,000                       0.171% of the city taxable income
  Over $12,000 but not over $500,000     $21 plus 0.228% of excess over
                                           $12,000
  Over $500,000                              Not applicable

  tax purposes; such interest income shall include the amount received  as
  dividends  from  a  regulated  investment company, as defined in section
  eight hundred fifty-one of the internal revenue  code,  which  has  been
  designated  as the amount of such interest income in a written notice to
  shareholders not later than  sixty  days  following  the  close  of  its
  taxable year; provided that, at the close of each quarter of the taxable
  year of such regulated investment company, at least fifty percent of the
  value of its total assets, as defined in subsection (c) of section eight
  hundred  fifty-one of the internal revenue code, consists of obligations
  of the United States  and  its  possessions.  The  aggregate  amount  so
  designated  by  the  regulated  investment  company for its taxable year
  shall  not  exceed  the  amount  determined  by  multiplying  the  total
  distributions   paid   by  such  regulated  investment  company  to  its


 shareholders with respect to that taxable year (attributable  to  income
  earned  in  that  year), including any such distributions paid after the
  close of the  taxable  year,  as  described  in  section  eight  hundred
  fifty-five  of the internal revenue code, by the ratio that the interest
  income received in that taxable year on obligations of the United States
  and its possessions, after reduction for  the  deductions  and  expenses
  directly  or  indirectly  attributable  thereto, bears to the investment
  company taxable income of such regulated  investment  company  for  such
  taxable year, determined without regard to subparagraph (D) of paragraph
  two of subsection (b) of section eight hundred fifty-two of the internal
  revenue code;
    (2)  Interest  or  dividend income on obligations or securities of any

  exempt from state income taxes under the laws of the United States;
    (3) (i)  Pensions  to  officers  and  employees  of  this  state,  its
  subdivisions  and agencies, to the extent includible in gross income for
  federal income tax purposes;
    (ii) Pensions to officers  and  employees  of  the  United  States  of

  attained the age of fifty-nine  and  one-half,  not  otherwise  excluded
  pursuant to paragraph three of this subsection, to the extent includible
  in  gross  income  for federal income tax purposes, but not in excess of
  twenty thousand dollars, which are  periodic  payments  attributable  to
  personal  services  performed by such individual prior to his retirement
  from employment, which arise (i) from an employer-employee  relationship
  or (ii) from contributions to a retirement plan which are deductible for
  federal  income tax purposes. However, the term "pensions and annuities"
  shall also include distributions  received  by  an  individual  who  has
  attained   the  age  of  fifty-nine  and  one-half  from  an  individual
  retirement account or an individual retirement annuity,  as  defined  in
  section   four   hundred   eight  of  the  internal  revenue  code,  and
  distributions received by an individual who  has  attained  the  age  of
  fifty-nine and one-half from self-employed individual and owner-employee
  retirement  plans  which  qualify  under section four hundred one of the
  internal revenue code, whether or  not  the  payments  are  periodic  in
  nature.  Nevertheless,  the  term  "pensions  and  annuities"  shall not
  include any lump sum distribution, as defined  in  subparagraph  (D)  of
  paragraph  four  of  subsection  (e)  of section four hundred two of the
  internal revenue code and taxed under section six hundred three of  this
  article. Where a husband and wife file a joint state personal income tax
  return,  the  modification  provided  for  in  this  paragraph  shall be
  computed as if they were  filing  separate  state  personal  income  tax
  returns.  Where a payment would otherwise come within the meaning of the
  term "pensions and annuities" as set forth  in  this  paragraph,  except
  that  such  individual is deceased, such payment shall, nevertheless, be
  treated as a pension or annuity for purposes of this paragraph  if  such
  payment is received by such individual's beneficiary.
    (3-b)  (i)  Disability income included in federal gross income, to the
  extent that such disability income would have been excluded from federal
  gross income pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) of section one
  hundred five of the internal revenue code of nineteen hundred fifty-four
  had such provisions continued in effect  for  taxable  years  commencing
  after  December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-three as they were


 in  effect  immediately  prior  to  the  repeal  of   such   subsection.
  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  sum of disability income excluded
  pursuant to this paragraph, and  pension  and  annuity  income  excluded
  pursuant  to  paragraph  three-a  of  this  subsection, shall not exceed
  twenty thousand dollars.
    (ii) Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this section, if a husband  and
  wife  determine  their  federal  income  tax  on  a joint return but are
  required to determine  their  New  York  income  taxes  separately,  the
  amounts  of  exclusion  allowed under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph
  shall be determined in the same joint manner as such amounts would  have
  been determined under the provisions of paragraph five of subsection (d)
  of  section  one  hundred  five  of  the  internal  revenue code as such
  provisions were in effect  immediately  prior  to  the  repeal  of  such
  subsection,  but shall be attributed for New York income tax purposes to
  the spouse who would have been required to report  any  such  amount  as
  income  if  the  spouses  had  determined  their  federal  income  taxes
  separately.
    (iii) Where a husband and wife file a joint state income  tax  return,
  the  twenty  thousand  dollar limitation provided in subparagraph (i) of
  this paragraph shall be applied as if they were  filing  separate  state
  income tax returns.

  sixty)  to  the  taxpayer, or to a decedent by reason of whose death the
  taxpayer acquired the right to receive the income or gain, or to a trust
  or estate from which the taxpayer received the income or gain;
    (6) Interest or dividend income on obligations or  securities  to  the
  extent  exempt  from income tax under the laws of this state authorizing
  the issuance of such obligations or securities but includible  in  gross
  income for federal income tax purposes; and
    (7) The amount of any refund or credit for overpayment of income taxes
  imposed  by  this state, or any other taxing jurisdiction, and any taxes
  imposed by article twenty-three of this chapter, to the extent  properly
  included in gross income for federal income tax purposes.

  development  to  a greater extent than originally reported, the taxpayer
  shall  report  such  use in his return for the first taxable year during
  which it occurs, and the tax commission may recompute the  tax  for  the
  year  or  years for which such deduction was allowed, and may assess any
  additional tax resulting from such recomputation within the  time  fixed
  by subsection (c) of section six hundred eighty-three of this article.

  nineteen hundred sixty-six, and October ten, nineteen hundred sixty-six,
  shall be read as December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven.  A
  taxpayer  shall  be allowed a deduction under clauses (A), (B) or (C) of
  this paragraph only if the tangible property shall be delivered  or  the
  construction, reconstruction or erection shall be completed on or before
  December  thirty-first,  nineteen hundred sixty-nine, except in the case
  of tangible property which is acquired,  constructed,  reconstructed  or
  erected  pursuant  to  a  contract  which  was,  on  or  before December
  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter,
  binding on the taxpayer. However, for any taxable year beginning  on  or
  after  January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not
  be allowed a modification under paragraph one of  this  subsection  with
  respect  to  tangible  personal  property  leased to any other person or
  corporation. For purposes of the preceding  sentence,  any  contract  or
  agreement  to  lease or rent or for a license to use such property shall
  be considered a lease. With respect to property which  a  taxpayer  uses
  for  purposes  other  than leasing for part of a taxable year and leases


 for a part of a taxable year, a modification under paragraph  one  shall
  be  allowed  in proportion to the part of the year such property is used
  by the taxpayer.
    (4)  For  purposes  of  this  paragraph,  such  modifications shall be
  allowed only with respect to  tangible  property  which  is  depreciable
  pursuant  to  section  one  hundred  sixty-seven of the internal revenue
  code, having a situs in this state and used in the taxpayer's  trade  or
  business.  The  modifications  provided  for  in  paragraph  one of this
  subsection shall be allowed only with respect to tangible property which
  is  (A)   constructed,   reconstructed   or   erected   after   December
  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, pursuant to a contract which
  was,  on  or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight,
  and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or,  property,  the
  physical  construction,  reconstruction or erection of which began on or
  before December thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight  or  which
  began  after such date pursuant to an order placed on or before December
  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, and then only  with  respect
  to  that  portion  of  the  basis  thereof  or the expenditures relating
  thereto  which  is   properly   attributable   to   such   construction,
  reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred
  sixty-three,  or  (B)  acquired  after  December  thirty-first, nineteen
  hundred sixty-seven, pursuant to a contract  which  was,  on  or  before
  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred sixty-eight, and at all times
  thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or pursuant to an order placed on or
  before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, by  purchase
  as  defined  in  section  one  hundred  seventy-nine (d) of the internal
  revenue code, if the original use of such property  commenced  with  the
  taxpayer,   commenced   in  this  state  and  commenced  after  December
  thirty-first,   nineteen   hundred   sixty-seven,   or   (C)   acquired,
  constructed,   reconstructed,   or   erected   subsequent   to  December
  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  sixty-eight,  if   such   acquisition,
  construction,  reconstruction  or  erection is pursuant to a plan of the
  taxpayer which was in existence December thirty-first, nineteen  hundred
  sixty-eight,   and  not  thereafter  substantially  modified,  and  such
  acquisition, construction,  reconstruction  or  erection  would  qualify
  under  the  rules  in  paragraphs four, five or six of subsection (h) of
  section forty-eight of the internal revenue code provided all references
  in such paragraphs four,  five  and  six  to  the  dates  October  nine,
  nineteen hundred sixty-six, and October ten, nineteen hundred sixty-six,
  shall  be read as December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight. A
  taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under clauses (A), (B) or  (C)  of
  the  preceding  sentence of this paragraph only if the tangible property
  shall be delivered or the construction, reconstruction or erection shall
  be completed  on  or  before  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
  seventy,  except  in  the  case  of tangible property which is acquired,
  constructed, reconstructed or erected pursuant to a contract which  was,
  on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, and at
  all  times thereafter binding on the taxpayer. The modification provided
  for in paragraph two of this  subsection  shall  be  allowed  only  with
  respect  to  tangible  property, (A) the construction, reconstruction or
  erection of which is completed  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen
  hundred  sixty-seven,  and then only with respect to that portion of the
  basis thereof or the expenditures relating  thereto  which  is  properly
  attributable  to  such  construction,  reconstruction  or erection after
  December thirty-first, nineteen hundred  sixty-three,  or  (B)  acquired
  after  December  thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, by purchase
  as defined in section one  hundred  seventy-nine  (d)  of  the  internal
  revenue  code,  if  the original use of such property commenced with the


 taxpayer,  commenced  in  this  state  and  commenced   after   December
  thirty-first,   nineteen   hundred  sixty-three.  Provided,  however,  a
  modification under paragraph one of this  subsection  shall  be  allowed
  with  respect  to property described in this paragraph only on condition
  that such property shall be principally used  by  the  taxpayer  in  the
  production  of goods by manufacturing; processing; assembling; refining;
  mining; extracting; farming;  agriculture;  horticulture;  floriculture;
  viticulture;  or  commercial  fishing.  For  purposes  of  the preceding
  sentence, manufacturing shall mean the process of working raw  materials
  into  wares suitable for use or which gives new shapes, new qualities or
  new  combinations  to  matter  which  already  has  gone  through   some
  artificial  process by the use of machinery, tools, appliances and other
  similar equipment. Property  used  in  the  production  of  goods  shall
  include  machinery,  equipment  or  other  tangible  property  which  is
  principally used in the repair and service of other machinery, equipment
  or other tangible property used principally in the production  of  goods
  and  shall  include  all facilities used in the manufacturing operation,
  including storage of material to be used in  manufacturing  and  of  the
  products  that  are manufactured. At the option of the taxpayer, air and
  water pollution control facilities which qualify for elective deductions
  under subsection (h) of section six hundred twelve may be  treated,  for
  purposes of this paragraph, as tangible property principally used in the
  production  of goods by manufacturing; processing; assembling; refining;
  mining; extracting; farming;  agriculture;  horticulture;  floriculture;
  viticulture;  or  commercial  fishing, in which event, a deduction shall
  not be allowed under such subsection (h). However, for any taxable  year
  beginning  on  or  after  January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, a
  taxpayer shall not be allowed a modification under paragraph one of this
  subsection with respect to tangible  personal  property  leased  to  any
  other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any
  contract  or  agreement  to  lease  or rent or for a license to use such
  property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property  which  a
  taxpayer uses for purposes other than leasing for part of a taxable year
  and  leases for a part of a taxable year, a modification under paragraph
  one shall be allowed in proportion to the part of the year such property
  is used by the taxpayer.
    (5) If the modifications allowable for any taxable  year  pursuant  to
  this  subsection  exceed  the taxpayer's New York adjusted gross income,
  determined without the allowance of such modifications, the  excess  may
  be  carried  over  to  the  following  taxable  year or years and may be
  subtracted from federal adjusted gross income for  such  year  or  years
  provided,  however,  that  in  no event shall such excess, insofar as it
  reflects subtractions taken with respect to items set forth in paragraph
  two of this subsection, be carried over to taxable years  commencing  on
  or after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-four.
    (6)  In  any  taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed
  of, with respect to which a modification has been  allowed  pursuant  to
  paragraph  one  or  two  of  this subsection, the basis of such property
  shall be adjusted to reflect the modifications so allowed,  and  if  the
  basis  as  so  adjusted  is  lower  than  the adjusted basis of the same
  property for federal income  tax  purposes,  there  shall  be  added  to
  federal  adjusted gross income the amount of the difference between such
  adjusted bases.
    (h) Optional modification for waste treatment  facility  expenditures.
  For  taxable  years  commencing prior to January first, nineteen hundred
  eighty-seven, at the election of  the  taxpayer,  there  shall  also  be
  subtracted  from  federal  adjusted  gross  income  expenditures paid or
  incurred during the taxable year for the  construction,  reconstruction,


 erection or improvement of industrial waste treatment facilities and air
  pollution control facilities.
    (1)  (A)  The  term "industrial waste treatment facilities" shall mean
  facilities  for  the  treatment,  neutralization,  or  stabilization  of
  industrial  waste  and other wastes (as the terms "industrial waste" and
  "other wastes" are defined  in  section  17-0105  of  the  environmental
  conservation  law)  from a point immediately preceding the point of such
  treatment, neutralization or stabilization to  the  point  of  disposal,
  including the necessary pumping and transmitting facilities.
    (B)  The term "air pollution control facilities" shall mean facilities
  which remove, reduce, or render less noxious  air  contaminants  emitted
  from  an  air  contamination  source (as the terms "air contaminant" and
  "air contamination  source"  are  defined  in  section  19-0107  of  the
  environmental  conservation  law) from a point immediately preceding the
  point of such removal, reduction or rendering to the point of  discharge
  of  air,  meeting emission standards as established by the department of
  environmental conservation but excluding such facilities  installed  for
  the  primary  purpose  of  salvaging  materials  which are usable in the
  manufacturing process or are marketable and excluding  those  facilities
  which rely for their efficacy on dilution, dispersion or assimilation of
  air  contaminants  in  the  ambient  air after emission. Such term shall
  further include flue gas desulfurization equipment and attendant  sludge
  disposal  facilities, fluidized bed boilers, precombustion coal cleaning
  facilities or other facilities that conform with  this  subdivision  and
  which  comply  with  the provisions of the state acid deposition control
  act set forth in title nine of article  nineteen  of  the  environmental
  conservation law.
    (2) Such modifications shall be allowed only
    (A)  with  respect to tangible property which is depreciable, pursuant
  to section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code,  having
  a  situs in this state and used in the taxpayer's trade or business, the
  construction, reconstruction, erection or improvement of which,  in  the
  case  of industrial waste treatment facilities, is initiated on or after
  January first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, or which, in the case of air
  pollution control facilities, is initiated on or  after  January  first,
  nineteen hundred sixty-six, and
    (B) on condition that such facilities have been certified by the state
  commissioner   of   environmental   conservation   or   his   designated
  representative,  pursuant  to  section  19-0309  of  the   environmental
  conservation  law,  as  complying  with the applicable provisions of the
  environmental  conservation  law,  the  public  health  law,  the  state
  sanitary   code   and  codes,  rules,  regulations,  permits  or  orders
  promulgated pursuant thereto, and
    (C) on condition that for the taxable year and all succeeding  taxable
  years,  any  deductions allowed for federal income tax purposes for such
  expenditures or for depreciation or amortization of the  same  property,
  except to the extent that its basis may be attributable to factors other
  than  such  expenditures,  be  added  to  federal  adjusted gross income
  pursuant to paragraph five of subsection (b) of this section, or in case
  a modification is allowable pursuant to this paragraph for only  a  part
  of  such  expenditures,  on condition that a proportionate amount of any
  such deductions allowed for federal income  tax  purposes  be  added  to
  federal adjusted gross income, and
    (D)  where  the election provided for in subsection (g) of section six
  hundred twelve has not been exercised in respect to the same property.
    (3) (A) If expenditures in respect to an  industrial  waste  treatment
  facility  or  an  air  pollution control facility have been allowed as a
  modification as provided herein and if within ten years from the end  of


 the taxable year in which such modification was allowed such property or
  any  part thereof is used for the primary purpose of salvaging materials
  which are usable in the manufacturing process  or  are  marketable,  the
  taxpayer  shall  report  such  change of use in its return for the first
  taxable year  during  which  it  occurs,  and  the  tax  commission  may
  recompute  the tax for the year or years for which such modification was
  allowed,  and  may  assess  any  additional  tax  resulting  from   such
  recomputation within the time fixed by paragraph eight of subsection (c)
  of section six hundred eighty-three.
    (B)  If  a modification is allowed as herein provided for expenditures
  paid or incurred during any taxable year on the  basis  of  a  temporary
  certificate   of   compliance   issued  pursuant  to  the  environmental
  conservation law, and if  the  taxpayer  fails  to  obtain  a  permanent
  certificate of compliance upon completion of the facilities with respect
  to  which  such  temporary  certificate  was  issued, the taxpayer shall
  report such failure in its report for the taxable year during which such
  facilities are completed, and the tax commission may recompute  the  tax
  for  the  year or years for which such modification was allowed, and may
  assess any additional tax resulting from such recomputation  within  the
  time  fixed  by paragraph eight of subsection (c) of section six hundred
  eighty-three.
    (C) If a modification is allowed as herein provided  for  expenditures
  paid  or incurred during any taxable year in respect to an air pollution
  control facility on the basis of  a  certificate  of  compliance  issued
  pursuant  to  the  environmental conservation law and the certificate is
  revoked  pursuant  to  subdivision  three  of  section  19-0309  of  the
  environmental conservation law, the tax commission may recompute the tax
  for  the  year  or  years  for  which  the facility is not or was not in
  compliance  with  the  applicable  provisions   of   the   environmental
  conservation  law, the state sanitary code or codes, rules, regulations,
  permits or orders issued pursuant thereto, and for which a  modification
  was  allowed,  and  may  assess  any  additional tax resulting from such
  recomputation within the time fixed by paragraph eight of subsection (c)
  of section six hundred eighty-three.
    (4) In any taxable year when property is sold  or  otherwise  disposed
  of,  with  respect  to which a modification has been allowed pursuant to
  this paragraph, such modification shall be disregarded in computing gain
  or loss, and the gain or loss on the sale or other disposition  of  such
  property  shall  be  the  gain  or loss entering into the computation of
  federal adjusted gross income for such taxable year.
    (i) In the case  of  mines,  oil  and  gas  wells  and  other  natural
  deposits, any allowance for percentage depletion pursuant to section six
  hundred  thirteen  or  section  six  hundred  thirteen A of the internal
  revenue code shall be added to federal adjusted gross  income.  However,
  with  respect  to  the  property  as  to  which such addition to federal
  adjusted gross income is required, an allowance for depletion  shall  be
  subtracted  from  federal adjusted gross income in the amount that would
  be deductible under section six hundred  eleven  of  such  code  if  the
  deduction for an allowance for depletion were computed without reference
  to  such section six hundred thirteen or section six hundred thirteen A.
  With  respect  to  the  computation  of  depletion  pursuant   to   this
  subsection,  the  basis for such computation for taxable years beginning
  in  nineteen  hundred  seventy-two  shall  be  the  federal  basis.  For
  subsequent  taxable  years,  the  basis  for  such  computation shall be
  reduced only by the deduction for the allowance for depletion deductible
  pursuant to this subsection. The portion of any gain from  the  sale  or
  other  disposition  of  such property having a higher adjusted basis for
  New York income tax purposes than for federal income tax purposes,  that


 does  not  exceed  such  difference  in  basis, shall be subtracted from
  federal adjusted gross income.
    (j)  Modification  for  nonpublic  school  tuition.  (1)  General.  An
  individual shall be entitled to subtract from his federal adjusted gross
  income an amount shown in the table set forth in this paragraph for  his
  New  York  adjusted  gross income for the taxable year, computed without
  the benefit of this  modification,  multiplied  by  the  number  of  his
  dependents,  not  exceeding  three,  attending  a  nonpublic school on a
  full-time basis for at least four months during the regular school  year
  for  the  education  of  such  dependent  in  grades one through twelve,
  provided such individual is  allowed  an  exemption  under  section  six
  hundred   sixteen  for  such  dependent.  Provided,  further,  that  the
  modification under this paragraph may be taken only if  such  individual
  has  paid  at  least fifty dollars for each such dependent in tuition to
  such nonpublic school for such education of such dependent. No  taxpayer
  shall  be entitled to the modification provided for in this paragraph if
  he claims a tuition reimbursement payment pursuant to  article  twelve-A
  of the education law.
    If New York                                         The amount

    (2)  Husband and wife. In determining the applicable New York adjusted
  gross income of a husband and wife for purposes of the table  set  forth
  in  paragraph one of this subsection, the New York adjusted gross income
  of a husband and wife shall be the aggregate of their New York  adjusted
  gross  incomes  for  the taxable year, determined without the benefit of
  the modification provided for in this  subsection,  and  the  number  of
  dependents  with respect to which this modification may be claimed shall
  be no more than three in the aggregate.

    (B)  the  amount  of  any  modifications  to federal gross income with
  respect to such stock pursuant to paragraph twenty of subsection (b)  of
  this section.
    (o)  Modifications  for  new business investment gains and certain new
  business investments.
    1. For purposes of this subsection, the  following  definitions  shall
  apply:
    (A)  "New  business investment gain" means gain from the sale of a new
  business  investment  issued  to  the  taxpayer  before  January  first,
  nineteen hundred eighty-eight, if:
    (i)  such  new  business  investment  is,  in  the hands of the person
  selling the same (whether or not  the  taxpayer),  a  capital  asset  as
  defined in section 1221 of the internal revenue code of nineteen hundred
  fifty-four, as amended, and
    (ii)  such  new  business  investment  was held by such person for the
  period specified in paragraph two of this subsection.
    (B) "New business" means a corporation  or  partnership  organized  or
  formed under the laws of any state which:
    (i)  adopts a plan on or after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-one
  and before January first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight,  to  conduct  a
  new  business within the meaning and intent of this section and to issue
  new business investments, as defined in this subsection, and
    (ii) is, at the date of adoption of such  plan,  subject  to  taxation
  (whether  or  not  any  amount  is  owing)  under  section  one  hundred
  eighty-three, one hundred  eighty-four  or  one  hundred  eighty-six  of
  article nine of this chapter, or under article nine-a of this chapter or
  article  twenty-three of this chapter, or would have been subject to tax
  under article twenty-three (as such article was  in  effect  on  January
  first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty) if such article were still in effect,
  and the first taxable period for which such new business became  subject
  to  such  taxation  commenced  on  or after July first, nineteen hundred
  eighty-one and before January first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight,  and
  such first taxable period includes the date of adoption of such plan; if
  not so subject to taxation, the new business must be subject to taxation
  under  such sections or articles for the first time within one year from
  the date of adoption of such plan, and


   (iii) is conducted (or will be conducted, as evidenced by  such  plan)
  whereby  at least ninety percent of the assets (valued at original cost)
  are located and employed  in  this  state  and  eighty  percent  of  the
  employees  (as ascertained within the meaning and intent of subparagraph
  three  of  paragraph (a) of subdivision three of section two hundred ten
  of this chapter  and,  in  addition,  in  the  case  of  a  partnership,
  excluding  partners)  are principally employed in this state during each
  taxable period, or part thereof, as required  by  clause  (iv)  of  this
  subparagraph, and
    (iv)  within  ninety  days  after  the adoption of such plan, or, if a
  return is required, as part of such return,  under  such  article  nine,
  article nine-A or article twenty-three (as such article was in effect on
  or before December thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-two), whichever is
  sooner,  shall  file  a  new  business  certificate  with  the state tax
  commission attesting to whether it meets, if subject to  taxation  under
  such  articles,  or  intends  to  meet,  if  not  so subject, all of the
  conditions stated in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)  of  this  subparagraph
  within  the  time  set  forth therein. Thereafter, during the first four
  taxable years of such new business, along with,  and  as  part  of,  any
  return  required  under  such articles, such new business shall make and
  file a new business certificate for the period covered  by  such  return
  attesting  to  whether  it  has  met  the  conditions  specified in this
  subparagraph during the taxable period covered by  such  return.  If  no
  return  is required under such articles, such certificate shall be filed
  annually on or before the fifteenth day of March which shall  cover  the
  twelve  consecutive  calendar  month  period  ending  on the last day of
  December  immediately  preceding  such  March  fifteenth.  If  such  new
  business  fails  to meet such conditions specified in this subparagraph,
  it shall, in addition,  give  notice  of  this  fact,  within  the  time
  prescribed  by  the  state  tax  commission,  to the holders of its "new
  business investments." The state tax commission shall prescribe the form
  and content of such new business certification and  may  require  a  new
  business  to  file  such  certificate  for periods (even if no return is
  filed or required, but for this section) covering up to eight years from
  the date of adoption of such plan, as in its discretion,  it  deems  the
  same necessary for the enforcement of this subparagraph, and
    (v) Special rules:
    (1)  For  any taxable period, in order to constitute a new business, a
  business enterprise must have derived more than  sixty  percent  of  its
  aggregate  gross  receipts  from  sources  other  than royalties, rents,
  dividends, interest, annuities  and  sales  or  exchanges  of  stock  or
  securities.
    (2)  A  new  business  does  not include (i) any new business of which
  twenty-five percent or more of  the  number  of  shares  of  stock  that
  entitle  the  holders  thereof  to vote for the election of directors or
  trustees is owned, directly or indirectly, by a taxpayer subject to  tax
  under  section  one  hundred  eighty-three, one hundred eighty-four, one
  hundred eighty-five or one hundred eighty-six of article  nine  of  this
  chapter,  or  under  article  nine-A, thirty-two or thirty-three of this
  chapter or (ii) any new business substantially similar in operation  and
  in ownership, directly or indirectly, to a business entity (or entities)
  taxable,  or  previously  taxable,  under  such sections, such articles,
  article twenty-three or which would  have  been  subject  to  tax  under
  article  twenty-three  (as  such article was in effect on January first,
  nineteen hundred eighty) or the income (or losses) of which is (or  was)
  includable  under  article  twenty-two whereby the intent and purpose of
  this subsection would be evaded.


   (C)  "New  business  investment"  means  and  includes  the  following
  investments  issued  before January first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight
  by a new business  pursuant  to  a  plan  described  in  clause  (i)  of
  subparagraph  (B)  of  this paragraph for money or other property (other
  than  stock  or  securities)  on  or  before the expiration of the third
  taxable  year  of  such  new  business  (excluding  any   short   period
  immediately preceding such taxable year because the new business was not
  in  existence  for  an entire taxable year) or forty-two months from the
  adoption of such  plan,  whichever  is  sooner:  (i)  original  issuance
  capital  stock  as  part  of  a  new issue, (ii) other original issuance
  securities of a new issue of a like nature as stocks which are  designed
  as  a  means  of  investment  and  issued  for  the purpose of financing
  corporate enterprises and providing for a distribution of rights in such
  enterprises, (iii) debt obligations such as bonds and debentures  for  a
  term  of  at  least  one  year,  whether  secured or unsecured, and (iv)
  certificates and other instruments representing  proprietary  interests,
  whether  limited or otherwise, in and assumption of general liabilities,
  whether limited or otherwise, of a partnership enterprise.
    2. A taxpayer may subtract from his federal adjusted  gross  income  a
  portion  of  an  amount  constituting a new business investment gain, as
  follows:
 
       If new business                    The modification is equal to the
       investment held for:               following proportion of the gain
                                          includable in federal adjusted
                                          gross income:
 
       At least four years, but
       less than five years               twenty-five percent
       At least five years, but
       less than six years                fifty percent
       At least six years                 one hundred percent
 
    3. Where, within six months of  the  realization  of  a  new  business
  investment gain allowable as the basis of a modification under paragraph
  two  of  this  subsection,  such  modification is equal to less than one
  hundred percent of  the  portion  of  the  gain  includable  in  federal
  adjusted  gross  income  and  the  taxpayer  purchases  a  new  business
  investment which is then held for a period of at least six  months,  the
  taxpayer may subtract from his federal adjusted gross income ten percent
  (but not an amount that will reduce the portion of such gain included in
  his  New  York  income  below zero) of the amount of such gain where the
  purchase price of the new business investment is  equal  to  or  greater
  than  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  giving  rise to such gain. Where the
  purchase price of the new business investment is  less  than  an  amount
  equal  to  the  proceeds  of such sale, the modification allowable under
  this paragraph shall be equal to ten percent of an amount equal  to  the
  product  of  (A) the amount of the gain and (B) a fraction the numerator
  of which is the purchase price of the new investment and the denominator
  of which  is  an  amount  equal  to  the  proceeds  of  such  sale.  The
  modification  allowable  under  this  paragraph  may be utilized, at the
  option of the taxpayer, with respect to the taxable year  in  which  the
  new business investment gain is realized or the year containing the last
  day of the six-month retention period described in this paragraph.
    4.  The  state tax commission may prescribe such rules and regulations
  as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subdivision.
    (p) New business investment  deferral.  For  taxable  years  beginning
  before  January  first,  nineteen hundred eighty-eight, at the option of


 the taxpayer, there may be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income
  a reinvested amount of long-term capital gain realized in a taxable year
  from the sale of a capital asset, as such term  is  defined  in  section
  1221  of  the  internal  revenue  code,  which  is  not  a  new business
  investment. A reinvested amount of long-term capital gain shall mean  an
  amount which bears the same ratio to the long-term capital gain realized
  from  the  sale  of  a  capital  asset  which was includable in New York
  adjusted gross income as that portion of  the  sale  proceeds  which  is
  reinvested,  within  one  year  from  date  of  sale,  in a New York new
  business bears to the total sale proceeds.  For  the  purposes  of  this
  subsection,  a  New York new business is a business enterprise which (1)
  has been a taxpayer under this article for no more  than  three  taxable
  years  (including  short  taxable  years), (2) over fifty percent of the
  number of shares of stock that entitle the holders thereof to  vote  for
  the  election  of  directors  or  trustees  is  not  owned,  directly or
  indirectly, by a taxpayer subject  to  tax  under  section  one  hundred
  eighty-three,  one  hundred  eighty-four, one hundred eighty-five or one
  hundred eighty-six of article nine of this  chapter,  or  under  article
  nine-A,   thirty-two  or  thirty-three  of  this  chapter,  (3)  is  not
  substantially similar in operation or ownership, directly or indirectly,
  to a business entity (or entities) taxable, or previously taxable, under
  such sections, such articles, article twenty-three or which  would  have
  been  subject  to tax under article twenty-three (as such article was in
  effect on January first, nineteen hundred  eighty)  or  the  income  (or
  losses) of which is (or was) includable under article twenty-two whereby
  the  intent  and purpose of this subsection would be evaded, (4) locates
  and employs at least ninety percent of its  assets  in  the  state,  (5)
  employs  principally  in  the  state eighty percent of its employees (as
  ascertained within the meaning  and  intent  of  subparagraph  three  of
  paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision three of section two hundred ten of this
  chapter and, in addition,  in  the  case  of  a  partnership,  excluding
  partners),  (6) derives less than forty percent of its gross income from
  dividends,  interest,  royalties  (other  than  mineral,  oil,  or   gas
  royalties  or  copyright  royalties),  and  annuities and (7) reports at
  least twenty-five hundred dollars in gross income in any  taxable  year.
  The  reinvested  amount  must  qualify  as a capital asset as defined in
  section 1221 of the internal revenue code and must be  retained  by  the
  taxpayer  for  at  least twelve months. The modification allowable under
  this subsection shall be utilized with respect to the  taxable  year  in
  which  the  twelve  month  retention  period  ends.  The commissioner of
  taxation and finance may  require  annual  information  reports  on  the
  investments in new businesses made pursuant to this subsection, and such
  other  reports  as  he  may require to ensure against the evasion of the
  intent and purposes of this subsection.
    (q) An amount deferred under subsection (p) hereof shall be  added  to
  federal  adjusted gross income when the reinvestment in the New York new
  business which qualified a taxpayer for such deferral is sold.
    (r) Related members expense add back.  (1)  Definitions.  (A)  Related
  member.   "Related   member"  means  a  related  person  as  defined  in
  subparagraph (c) of paragraph three of subsection (b)  of  section  four
  hundred  sixty-five  of  the  internal  revenue code, except that "fifty
  percent" shall be substituted for "ten percent".
    (B) Effective rate of tax. "Effective rate of tax" means,  as  to  any
  state  or  U.S. possession, the maximum statutory rate of tax imposed by
  the state or possession on or measured by a related member's net  income
  multiplied  by  the  apportionment percentage, if any, applicable to the
  related member under the laws of said jurisdiction. For purposes of this
  definition, the effective rate of tax as to any state or U.S. possession


 is zero where the related member's net  income  tax  liability  in  said
  jurisdiction  is reported on a combined or consolidated return including
  both the taxpayer and the related member where the reported transactions
  between  the  taxpayer  and the related member are eliminated or offset.
  Also, for purposes of this definition, when computing the effective rate
  of tax for a jurisdiction in which a  related  member's  net  income  is
  eliminated or offset by a credit or similar adjustment that is dependent
  upon  the  related  member  either  maintaining  or  managing intangible
  property or collecting interest income in that jurisdiction, the maximum
  statutory rate of tax imposed by said jurisdiction shall be decreased to
  reflect the statutory rate of tax that applies to the related member  as
  effectively reduced by such credit or similar adjustment.
    (C) Royalty payments. Royalty payments are payments directly connected
  to  the  acquisition,  use,  maintenance or management, ownership, sale,
  exchange, or any other disposition of licenses, trademarks,  copyrights,
  trade  names,  trade  dress,  service  marks, mask works, trade secrets,
  patents and any other similar types of intangible assets  as  determined
  by   the   commissioner,  and  include  amounts  allowable  as  interest
  deductions under section one hundred sixty-three of the internal revenue
  code to the extent such amounts are directly or indirectly for,  related
  to   or   in  connection  with  the  acquisition,  use,  maintenance  or
  management, ownership, sale, exchange or disposition of such  intangible
  assets.
    (D)  Valid  business  purpose. A valid business purpose is one or more
  business purposes, other than the avoidance or  reduction  of  taxation,
  which alone or in combination constitute the primary motivation for some
  business  activity or transaction, which activity or transaction changes
  in a meaningful way, apart from tax effects, the  economic  position  of
  the taxpayer. The economic position of the taxpayer includes an increase
  in  the  market share of the taxpayer, or the entry by the taxpayer into
  new business markets.
    (2) Royalty expense add backs. (A) For the purpose  of  computing  New
  York  adjusted  gross  income, a taxpayer must add back royalty payments
  directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred in connection with one
  or more direct or indirect transactions with one or more related members
  during the taxable year to the extent deductible in calculating  federal
  taxable income.
    (B)  Exceptions.  (i) The adjustment required in this subsection shall
  not apply to the portion  of  the  royalty  payment  that  the  taxpayer
  establishes,  by  clear  and  convincing evidence of the type and in the
  form  specified  by  the  commissioner,  meets  all  of  the   following
  requirements: (I) the related member was subject to tax in this state or
  another  state or possession of the United States or a foreign nation or
  some combination thereof on a tax base that included the royalty payment
  paid, accrued or incurred by  the  taxpayer;  (II)  the  related  member
  during  the  same  taxable  year directly or indirectly paid, accrued or
  incurred such portion to a person that is  not  a  related  member;  and
  (III)  the  transaction  giving  rise to the royalty payment between the
  taxpayer and the related member was  undertaken  for  a  valid  business
  purpose.
    (ii) The adjustment required in this subsection shall not apply if the
  taxpayer  establishes,  by clear and convincing evidence of the type and
  in the form specified by the commissioner, that: (I) the related  member
  was  subject  to  tax  on or measured by its net income in this state or
  another state or possession of the United  States  or  some  combination
  thereof;  (II)  the  tax  base for said tax included the royalty payment
  paid, accrued or incurred by  the  taxpayer;  and  (III)  the  aggregate
  effective   rate   of  tax  applied  to  the  related  member  in  those


 jurisdictions is no less than eighty percent of the  statutory  rate  of
  tax  that  applied to the taxpayer under section six hundred one of this
  article for the taxable year.
    (iii)  The  adjustment  required in this subsection shall not apply if
  the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of  the  type
  and  in  the  form  specified by the commissioner, that: (I) the royalty
  payment was paid, accrued or incurred  to  a  related  member  organized
  under  the  laws  of  a  country  other than the United States; (II) the
  related  member's  income  from  the  transaction  was  subject   to   a
  comprehensive  income  tax  treaty  between  such country and the United
  States; (III) the related member was subject to tax in a foreign  nation
  on  a  tax  base  that  included  the  royalty  payment paid, accrued or
  incurred by the taxpayer; (IV) the  related  member's  income  from  the
  transaction  was taxed in such country at an effective tax rate at least
  equal to that imposed by this state; and (V)  the  royalty  payment  was
  paid,  accrued or incurred pursuant to a transaction that was undertaken
  for a valid business purpose and  using  terms  that  reflect  an  arm's
  length relationship.
    (iv) The adjustment required in this subsection shall not apply if the
  taxpayer and the commissioner agree in writing to the application or use
  of alternative adjustments or computations. The commissioner may, in his
  or  her  discretion,  agree  to  the  application  or use of alternative
  adjustments or computations when he or she concludes that in the absence
  of such agreement the income of  the  taxpayer  would  not  be  properly
  reflected.
    (s)  New  York  S  termination year. (1) General. In the case of a New
  York S termination year, the amount of any item of S corporation income,
  loss and deduction included in the shareholder's federal adjusted  gross
  income  and any reductions for taxes (as described in paragraphs two and
  three of subsection (f) of section thirteen  hundred  sixty-six  of  the
  internal  revenue  code)  shall  be  adjusted  in  accordance  with  the
  treatment provided in paragraph two or three of this subsection.
    (2) Pro rata allocation. Unless paragraph  three  of  this  subsection
  applies,  an  equal portion of each S corporation item shall be assigned
  to each day of the S corporation's taxable year for federal  income  tax
  purposes.  The portion of each such item thereby assigned to the S short
  year shall be treated as an item of a New York S  corporation,  and  the
  portion  of each such item thereby assigned to the C short year shall be
  treated as  an  item  of  an  S  corporation  which  is  a  New  York  C
  corporation.
    (3)  Normal  tax  accounting.  The  portion of each S corporation item
  assigned to the S short year and the C short year  shall  be  determined
  using normal tax accounting rules if:
    (A)  there is a sale or exchange of fifty percent or more of the stock
  in such corporation during the New York S termination year; or
    (B) the corporation so elects, in  the  manner  the  commissioner  may
  provide.  No  election under this subparagraph shall be effective unless
  all persons who are shareholders during the S short year and all persons
  who are shareholders on the first day of the C  short  year  consent  to
  such election.
    (u)  Emerging  technology investment deferral. In the case of any sale
  of a qualified emerging  technologies  investment  held  for  more  than
  thirty-six  months  and  with  respect  to which the taxpayer elects the
  application of this subsection, gain from such sale shall be  recognized
  only  to  the  extent  that the amount realized on such sale exceeds the
  cost of any qualified emerging technologies investment purchased by  the
  taxpayer during the three hundred sixty-five-day period beginning on the
  date  of such sale, reduced by any portion of such cost previously taken


 into account under this subsection. For purposes of this subsection  the
  following shall apply:
    (1)  A  qualified investment is stock of a corporation or an interest,
  other than as a creditor, in a partnership or limited liability  company
  that was acquired by the taxpayer as provided in Internal Revenue Code §
  1202(c)(1)(B),  except  that  the  reference to the term "stock" in such
  section shall be read as "investment," or by the taxpayer from a  person
  who had acquired such stock or interest in such a manner.
    (2)   A  qualified  emerging  technology  investment  is  a  qualified
  investment, that was held  by  the  taxpayer  for  at  least  thirty-six
  months,  in  a  company  defined  in paragraph (c) of subdivision one of
  section thirty-one hundred two-e of the public  authorities  law  or  an
  investment  in  a partnership or limited liability company that is taxed
  as a  partnership  to  the  extent  that  such  partnership  or  limited
  liability company invests in qualified emerging technology companies.
    (3)  For  purposes  of  determining whether the nonrecognition of gain
  under this subsection  applies  to  a  qualified  emerging  technologies
  investment  that  is  sold,  the  taxpayer's  holding  period  for  such
  investment and the qualified emerging technologies  investment  that  is
  purchased  shall be determined without regard to Internal Revenue Code §
  1223.
    (v) Amounts deferred. The amount deferred under subsection (u) of this
  section shall be  added  to  federal  adjusted  gross  income  when  the
  reinvestment in the New York qualified emerging technology company which
  qualified a taxpayer for such deferral is sold.
    (w)  Alimony  modifications.  (1) In the case of applicable alimony or
  separate maintenance payments, the following modifications shall apply:
    (A) There shall be subtracted from federal adjusted gross  income  any
  applicable alimony or separate maintenance payments made by the taxpayer
  during the taxable year.
    (B)  There  shall  be  added  to  federal  adjusted  gross  income any
  applicable alimony or separate  maintenance  payments  received  by  the
  taxpayer during the taxable year.
    (2)  (A)  The  term  "alimony  or separate maintenance payments" means
  payments as defined under section seventy-one of  the  internal  revenue
  code in effect immediately prior to the enactment of Public Law 115-97.
    (B)  The  term  "applicable  alimony or separate maintenance payments"
  means payments made  under  an  alimony  or  separation  instrument  (as
  defined  in  section  seventy-one of the internal revenue code in effect
  immediately prior to the  enactment  of  Public  Law  115-97)  that  was
  executed  after  December  thirty-first,  two thousand eighteen, and any
  divorce or separation instrument executed on or  before  such  date  and
  modified after such date if the modification expressly provides that the
  amendments made by this section apply to such modification.
    (x) Qualified moving expense reimbursement and moving expenses. (1) In
  the case of applicable qualified moving expense reimbursement and moving
  expenses, the following modifications shall apply:
    (A)  There  shall be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income any
  applicable  qualified  moving  expense  reimbursement  received  by  the
  taxpayer during the taxable year.
    (B)  There  shall be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income any
  applicable moving expenses paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year.
    (2) Applicable  qualified  moving  expense  reimbursement  and  moving
  expenses  are  those  deductions as allowed by paragraph (g) of sections
  one hundred thirty-two and section two hundred seventeen,  respectfully,
  of  the  internal  revenue  code  immediately  prior to the enactment of
  Public Law 115-97.




   §  613.  New  York  deduction  of  a resident individual. The New York
  deduction of a resident  individual  shall  be  his  New  York  standard
  deduction  unless  he  elects  to deduct his New York itemized deduction
  under the conditions set forth in section six hundred  fifteen  of  this
  article.  If  an  individual taxpayer has elected to deduct his New York
  itemized deduction computed pursuant to section six hundred  fifteen  of
  this  article,  but the department determines that the New York standard
  deduction allowable pursuant to section six  hundred  fourteen  of  this
  article  is  greater,  the department shall recompute the taxpayer's tax
  liability pursuant to section six hundred eleven of this  article  using
  the New York standard deduction provided in section six hundred fourteen
  of  this  article.  The  department  will  notify  the  taxpayer  of any
  adjustment to the election.




   §  614.  New  York  standard  deduction of a resident individual.  (a)
  Unmarried individual. For taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred
  ninety-six, the New York standard deduction of a resident individual who
  is not married nor the head of a household nor a surviving spouse nor an
  individual who is claimed as a  dependent  by  another  New  York  state
  taxpayer shall be seven thousand five hundred dollars; for taxable years
  beginning  in nineteen hundred ninety-six, such standard deduction shall
  be seven thousand four hundred dollars; for taxable years  beginning  in
  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five,  such  standard  deduction  shall be six
  thousand six hundred dollars; and  for  taxable  years  beginning  after
  nineteen  hundred  eighty-nine  and before nineteen hundred ninety-five,

  nineteen hundred eighty-eight, twenty-five percent, by a  fraction,  the
  numerator of which is the lesser of fifty thousand dollars or the excess
  of  such  individual's  New York adjusted gross income over four hundred
  seventy-five thousand dollars and the  denominator  of  which  is  fifty
  thousand dollars.
    (g)  Notwithstanding  subsection  (a)  of  this  section, the New York
  itemized deduction for charitable  contributions  shall  be  the  amount
  allowed  under section one hundred seventy of the internal revenue code,
  as modified by paragraph nine of subsection (c) of this section  and  as
  limited  by this subsection. (1) With respect to an individual whose New
  York adjusted gross income is over one million dollars and no more  than
  ten  million dollars, the New York itemized deduction shall be an amount
  equal to fifty percent of any charitable contribution deduction  allowed
  under  section  one  hundred  seventy  of  the internal revenue code for
  taxable years beginning after two thousand nine and before two  thousand
  twenty-five. With respect to an individual whose New York adjusted gross
  income  is  over  one  million  dollars, the New York itemized deduction
  shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of any charitable contribution
  deduction allowed under section one  hundred  seventy  of  the  internal
  revenue  code  for taxable years beginning in two thousand nine or after
  two thousand twenty-four.
    (2) With respect to an individual whose New York adjusted gross income
  is over ten million dollars, the New York itemized deduction shall be an
  amount equal to  twenty-five  percent  of  any  charitable  contribution
  deduction  allowed  under  section  one  hundred seventy of the internal
  revenue code for taxable years beginning after  two  thousand  nine  and
  ending before two thousand twenty-five.




   §  616. New York exemptions of a resident individual. (a) General. For
  taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred eighty-seven, a  resident
  individual shall be allowed a New York exemption of one thousand dollars
  for  each  exemption  for  which  he  is entitled to a deduction for the
  taxable year under section one  hundred  fifty-one(c)  of  the  Internal
  Revenue  Code;  and  for  taxable  years  beginning  in nineteen hundred
  eighty-seven, a resident individual other than a taxpayer whose  federal
  exemption  amount  is zero shall be allowed a New York exemption of nine
  hundred dollars for each  exemption  for  which  he  is  entitled  to  a
  deduction for the taxable year for federal income tax purposes.
    (b)  Husband  and  wife. If the New York income taxes of a husband and
  wife are required to be separately determined but their  federal  income
  tax  is  determined  on a joint return, each of them shall be separately
  entitled to the New York exemptions under subsection (a) of this section
  to which each would be separately entitled for the taxable year if their
  federal income taxes had been determined on separate returns.




   §  617.  Resident  partners  and shareholders of S corporations.   (a)
  Partner's and  shareholder's  modifications.  In  determining  New  York
  adjusted  gross income and New York taxable income of a resident partner
  or a  resident  shareholder  of  an  S  corporation  (other  than  an  S
  corporation  which  is  a  New  York  C  corporation),  any modification
  described in subsections (b), (c) or (d) of section six hundred  twelve,
  subsection  (c)  of section six hundred fifteen or paragraphs (2) or (3)
  of subsection  (d)  of  such  section,  which  relates  to  an  item  of
  partnership  or  S  corporation income, gain, loss or deduction shall be
  made  in  accordance  with  the  partner's  distributive  share  or  the
  shareholder's  pro  rata  share, for federal income tax purposes, of the
  item to which the modification relates.  Where a partner's  distributive
  share or a shareholder's pro rata share of any such item is not required
  to be taken into account separately for federal income tax purposes, the
  partner's  or  shareholder's  share  of such item shall be determined in
  accordance  with  his  share,  for  federal  income  tax  purposes,   of
  partnership  or  S corporation taxable income or loss generally.  In the
  case of a New York S termination year, his pro rata share  of  any  such
  item  shall  be  determined  under subsection (s) of section six hundred
  twelve.
    (b) Character of items. Each item of  partnership  and  S  corporation
  income,  gain,  loss,  or  deduction shall have the same character for a
  partner or shareholder under this article  as  for  federal  income  tax
  purposes.  Where  an  item  is  not characterized for federal income tax
  purposes, it shall have the same character for a partner or  shareholder
  as  if  realized  directly  from  the  source from which realized by the
  partnership or S corporation or incurred in the same manner as  incurred
  by the partnership or S corporation.
    (c)  New York tax avoidance or evasion. Where a partner's distributive
  share of an item of partnership  income,  gain,  loss  or  deduction  is
  determined  for  federal income tax purposes by special provision in the
  partnership agreement with respect to such item, and where the principal
  purpose of such provision is the avoidance or evasion of tax under  this
  article,  the  partner's  distributive  share  of  such  item,  and  any
  modification required with respect thereto, shall be  determined  as  if
  the partnership agreement made no special provision with respect to such
  item.






	

   §  617-a.  Residents;  special  provisions.  Notwithstanding any other
  provisions of this article, the New York adjusted gross income  and  the
  New  York  taxable  income  of  a  resident  individual  or partner of a
  partnership doing an insurance business as a  member  of  the  New  York
  insurance  exchange described in section six thousand two hundred one of
  the insurance law, shall not include any item of income, gain,  loss  or
  deduction  of  such  business, which is the individual's distributive or
  pro rata share for federal income tax purposes or which  the  individual
  is  required  to  take  into  account  separately for federal income tax
  purposes. Provided however, such individual's New  York  adjusted  gross
  income shall include his distributive or pro rata share of the allocated
  entire  net income as determined by such business under sections fifteen
  hundred three and fifteen hundred four of this  chapter.  In  the  event
  such  allocated  entire  net  income  is  a  loss,  there  shall  not be
  subtracted from federal adjusted gross  income  in  computing  New  York
  adjusted gross income such individual's distributive share of such loss.




   §  618. New York taxable income of a resident estate or trust. The New
  York taxable income of a resident estate  or  trust  means  its  federal
  taxable  income  as  defined  in  the  laws of the United States for the
  taxable year, with the following modifications:
    (2)  There  shall  be  subtracted  the  modifications   described   in
  paragraphs  (4) and (5) of subsection (c) of section six hundred twelve,

  the extent such gains are excluded from federal distributable net income
  of the estate or trust.

  of  the  estate or trust in the New York fiduciary adjustment determined
  under section six hundred nineteen.

  modifications described in paragraphs (6), (10), (17), (18), (19), (20),

  hundred twelve of this part.

    * (4) There shall be added or subtracted (as  the  case  may  be)  the
  modifications described in paragraphs (6), (10), (17), (18), (19), (20),

  subsection (b) and in paragraphs (11), (13),  (15),  (19),  (20),  (21),
  (22),  (23),  (24), (25), (26) and (28) of subsection (c) of section six
  hundred twelve of this part.
    * NB Effective when ch. 782/88 expires
    (5) In the case of a trust, there shall be added  the  amount  of  any
  includible  gain,  reduced by any deductions properly allocable thereto,
  upon which tax is imposed for the taxable year pursuant to  section  six
  hundred forty-four of the internal revenue code.




   §  619.  Share  of a resident estate, trust or beneficiary in New York
  fiduciary adjustment.
    (a) General. An adjustment shall  be  made  in  determining  New  York
  taxable  income  of a resident estate or trust under section six hundred
  eighteen, or New York adjusted gross income of a resident beneficiary of
  any estate or trust under subsection (d) of section six hundred  twelve,
  in  the amount of the share of each in the New York fiduciary adjustment
  as determined in this section.
    (b) Definition. The New York fiduciary adjustment  shall  be  the  net
  amount  of  the  modifications  described  in section six hundred twelve
  (including subsection (d) if the estate or trust  is  a  beneficiary  of
  another  estate  or trust), in subsection (c) and paragraphs (2) and (3)
  of subsection (d) of section six hundred fifteen, and in subsection  (e)
  of  this  section,  which  relate  to  items  of  income,  gain, loss or
  deduction of an estate or trust. The net amount  of  such  modifications
  shall not include:
    (1) Any modification described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection
  (b)  and paragraphs (1), (2), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of subsection (c) of
  section six hundred twelve with respect to any amount which, pursuant to
  the terms of the governing instrument, is paid or permanently set  aside
  for a charitable purpose during the taxable year, and
    (2)  Any  modification described in paragraph (4) or (5) of subsection
  (c) of section six hundred twelve, with respect to gains from  the  sale
  or  other disposition of property, to the extent such gains are excluded
  from federal distributable net income of the estate or trust.
    (c) Shares of New York fiduciary adjustment.
    (1) The respective shares of an estate or trust and its  beneficiaries
  (including,  solely  for  the  purpose  of  this allocation, nonresident
  beneficiaries)  in  the  New  York  fiduciary  adjustment  shall  be  in
  proportion  to  their  respective  shares  of  federal distributable net
  income of the estate or trust.
    (2) If the estate or trust has no federal distributable net income for
  the taxable year,  the  share  of  each  beneficiary  in  the  New  York
  fiduciary  adjustment  shall be in proportion to his share of the estate
  or trust income  for  such  year,  under  local  law  or  the  governing
  instrument,  which is required to be distributed currently and any other
  amounts of such income distributed in such year. Any balance of the  New
  York fiduciary adjustment shall be allocated to the estate or trust.
    (d)  Alternate attribution of modifications. The tax commission may by
  regulation establish such other method or methods of determining to whom
  the items comprising the fiduciary adjustment shall  be  attributed,  as
  may  be  appropriate  and  equitable.  Such  method  may  be used by the
  fiduciary in his discretion whenever the  allocation  of  the  fiduciary
  adjustment  pursuant to subsection (c) would result in an inequity which
  is substantial both in amount and in  relation  to  the  amount  of  the
  fiduciary adjustment.
    (e) Additional modifications. (1) For any taxable year beginning after
  December thirty-first, two thousand seventeen, and before January first,
  two  thousand twenty-six, to the extent that the estate or trust claimed
  a deduction for taxes under section 164 of  the  internal  revenue  code
  that  was  limited  to  ten  thousand  dollars  as  provided  in section
  164(b)(6)(B) or was denied as a result of  section  164(b)(6)(A),  there
  shall be subtracted the taxes paid or accrued in that taxable year by an
  estate  or  trust  that  the  estate or trust was not able to deduct for
  federal income tax purposes because of such limitation or denial,  other
  than state and local sales taxes and income taxes described in paragraph
  one  of  subsection  (c) of section six hundred fifteen of this part. In
  determining the makeup of the ten thousand dollars of deduction  claimed


 by  the  estate or trust under section 164 of the internal revenue code,
  it shall be presumed that the ten thousand dollars  of  deduction  first
  comprises  the state and local sales taxes or income taxes the estate or
  trust accrued or paid during the taxable year.
    (2)  For  any  taxable year beginning after December thirty-first, two
  thousand seventeen, and before January first, two  thousand  twenty-six,
  there  shall  be  subtracted  the  miscellaneous  itemized deductions as
  described in and limited by section 67 of the internal revenue code (but
  excluding the deductions described in subsection (e) of section 67), but
  determined without regard to subsection (g) of such section.
    (3) For any taxable year, there shall  be  added  the  amount  of  any
  deduction allowed pursuant to section 199A of the internal revenue code.




   § 620. Credit for income tax of another state. (a) General. A resident
  shall  be  allowed  a  credit  against  the tax otherwise due under this
  article for any income tax imposed on such individual  for  the  taxable
  year  by  another state of the United States, a political subdivision of
  such state, the District of Columbia  or  a  province  of  Canada,  upon
  income both derived therefrom and subject to tax under this article. The
  term "income tax imposed" in the previous sentence shall not include the
  portion  of  such  tax (determined in the manner provided for in section
  six hundred twenty-A) which is imposed upon the ordinary income  portion
  (or  part  thereof)  of  a lump sum distribution which is subject to the
  separate tax imposed by section six hundred three.
    (b) Pass-through entity taxes. (1)  A  resident  shall  be  allowed  a
  credit  against  the  tax otherwise due pursuant to this article for any
  pass-through  entity  tax  substantially  similar  to  the  tax  imposed
  pursuant  to article twenty-four-A of this chapter imposed on the income
  of a partnership or S corporation of which the resident  is  a  partner,
  member  or  shareholder  for  the  taxable  year by another state of the
  United States, a political subdivision of such state, or the District of
  Columbia upon income both derived therefrom and  subject  to  tax  under
  this article.
    (2)  Such  credit shall be equal to the taxpayer's direct share of the
  pass-through entity tax paid by the electing partnership or  electing  S
  corporation  to  such  other  state, political subdivision of such other
  state or the District of Columbia.
    (3) However, such credit will be allowed on tax paid only if:
    (A) the state of the United  States,  political  subdivision  of  such
  state,  or  the  District  of Columbia imposing such tax also imposes an
  income tax substantially similar to the tax imposed under this  article;
  and
    (B)  in the case of taxes paid by an S corporation, such S corporation
  was treated as a New York S corporation.
    (c) Limitations. (1) The credit under this section  shall  not  exceed
  the percentage of the tax otherwise due under this article determined by
  dividing  the  portion  of  the  taxpayer's  New  York income subject to
  taxation  by  such  other  jurisdiction  by  the  total  amount  of  the
  taxpayer's New York income.
    (2)  The  credit under this section shall not reduce the tax otherwise
  due under this article to an amount less than would have been due if the
  income subject to taxation by such other jurisdiction were excluded from
  the taxpayer's New York income.
    (3) In the case of a taxpayer who elects  to  claim  the  foreign  tax
  credit  for  federal  income tax purposes, the credit under this section
  for income tax imposed by a province of Canada shall be allowed for that
  portion of the provincial tax not claimed for federal purposes  for  the
  taxable  year  or  a  preceding  taxable  year, provided however, to the
  extent the  provincial  tax  is  claimed  for  federal  purposes  for  a
  succeeding  taxable  year,  the  credit under this section must be added
  back in such succeeding taxable year. The provincial tax shall be deemed
  to be claimed last for federal income tax purposes and for  purposes  of
  this subsection.
    (d) Definition. For purposes of this section New York income means:
    (1) the New York adjusted gross income of an individual, or
    (2)  the  amount of the income of an estate or trust, determined as if
  the estate or trust were an individual computing his New  York  adjusted
  gross income under section six hundred twelve.




   § 620-A. Credit against separate tax. (a) General. A resident shall be
  allowed  a  credit  against the separate tax otherwise due under section
  six hundred three for any income tax imposed for  the  taxable  year  by
  another  state  of  the  United  States, a political subdivision of such
  state, the District of Columbia  or  a  province  of  Canada,  upon  the
  ordinary  income  portion  (or  part thereof) of a lump sum distribution
  both derived therefrom and subject to tax under such section. Where such
  ordinary income portion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution  is
  not  subject  to  separate  income  taxation  by such other state or its
  political subdivision or the District  of  Columbia  or  a  province  of
  Canada,  but  is  included as income under an income tax imposed by such
  jurisdiction, the portion of the tax on such  income  which  constitutes
  the income tax imposed on such ordinary income portion (or part thereof)
  of  a lump sum distribution shall be an amount bearing the same ratio to
  the entire tax paid to such other jurisdiction  as  the  amount  of  the
  ordinary  income  portion  (or  part thereof) of a lump sum distribution
  included in the income subject to such tax bears to all  income  subject
  to such tax.
    (b)  Limitations.  (1)  The credit under this section shall not exceed
  the percentage of the tax otherwise due under section six hundred  three
  determined  by  dividing  the  portion of the taxpayer's ordinary income
  portion of a lump  sum  distribution  taxable  both  under  section  six
  hundred  three and by such other jurisdiction by the total amount of the
  taxpayer's ordinary income portion of a lump  sum  distribution  taxable
  under section six hundred three.
    (2)  The  credit under this section shall not reduce the tax otherwise
  due under section six hundred three to an amount less  than  would  have
  been  due  if  the  portion of the ordinary income portion of a lump sum
  distribution taxable both under section six hundred three  and  by  such
  other  jurisdiction  were  excluded from the computation of the separate
  tax imposed under section six hundred three.
    (3) In the case of a taxpayer who elects  to  claim  the  foreign  tax
  credit  for  federal  income tax purposes, the credit under this section
  for income tax imposed by a province of Canada shall be allowed for that
  portion of the provincial tax not claimed for federal purposes  for  the
  taxable  year  or  a  preceding  taxable  year, provided however, to the
  extent the  provincial  tax  is  claimed  for  federal  purposes  for  a
  succeeding  taxable  year,  the  credit under this section must be added
  back in such succeeding taxable year. The provincial tax shall be deemed
  to be claimed last for federal income tax purposes and for  purposes  of
  this subsection.


   §   621.   Credits   to   trust   beneficiary  receiving  accumulation
  distribution.  (a) General. A resident beneficiary of a trust whose  New
  York  adjusted  gross  income  includes  all  or part of an accumulation
  distribution by such trust, as defined in section six hundred sixty-five
  of the internal revenue code, including a beneficiary who is required to
  make the modification required by paragraph forty of subsection  (b)  of
  section  six  hundred twelve of this part, shall be allowed (1) a credit
  against  the  tax  otherwise  due  under  this  article  for  all  or  a
  proportionate  part  of  any tax paid by the trust under this article or
  under former article sixteen of this chapter (as  such  article  was  in
  effect on or before December thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty), for any
  preceding  taxable  year  which would not have been payable if the trust
  had in fact made distributions to its beneficiaries at the times and  in
  the  amounts  specified in section six hundred sixty-six of the internal
  revenue code; and (2) a credit against the taxes imposed by this article
  for the taxable year for any income tax imposed on  the  trust  for  the
  taxable  year  or  any prior taxable year by another state of the United
  States, a political subdivision thereof, or the  District  of  Columbia,
  upon  income  both  derived  therefrom  and  subject  to  tax under this
  article, provided that the amount of the credit  shall  not  exceed  the
  percentage  of  the  tax  otherwise due under this article determined by
  dividing the portion of the income that is both taxable to the trust  in
  such  other  jurisdiction  and  taxable  to  the  beneficiary under this
  article by the total amount of the beneficiary's New York income.
    (b) Limitation. The credits under this section shall  not  reduce  the
  tax  otherwise  due from the beneficiary under this article to an amount
  less than would have been due if the accumulation  distribution  or  his
  part thereof were excluded from his New York adjusted gross income.




   §  624.  Computation of separate tax on the ordinary income portion of
  lump sum distributions received by  resident  individuals,  estates  and
  trusts.  (a)  Amount  of  separate  tax. The amount of tax imposed under
  section six hundred three for any taxable  year,  with  respect  to  the
  ordinary  income  portion  of  a  lump  sum  distribution  received by a
  resident individual, estate or trust is an amount equal  to  five  times
  the  tax which would be imposed by subsection (c) of section six hundred
  one if the recipient of such lump sum distribution  were  an  individual
  referred  to  in such subsection and the New York taxable income were an
  amount equal to one-fifth of the excess of:
    (1) the total taxable amount of the  lump  sum  distribution  for  the
  taxable year, over
    (2) the minimum distribution allowance.
    (b)  Minimum distribution allowance. For purposes of this section, the
  minimum  distribution  allowance  shall  be  that  which  is  calculated

  be  deemed  to  be references to this section, and except that only lump
  sum distributions (or portions thereof)  and  distributions  of  annuity
  contracts  subject  to  tax  under  this  article shall be included, and
  except that references to the secretary shall be deemed to be references
  to the tax commission.

  following  provisions  shall  apply,  to  the  extent  applicable to the
  taxpayer's federal tax on lump sum distributions:  (1)  the  definitions

  a  rate  of  five  and  four-tenths  percent, and (ii) in the event that
  paragraph five of such subsection is applicable, the  words  "five"  and
  "one-fifth" in subsection (a) of this section shall be read as "ten" and
  "one-tenth",  respectively,  and subsection (a) of this section shall be

  six  hundred  two  as  such  subsection  was in effect for taxable years
  beginning in nineteen hundred eighty-six.

   §  631.  New  York  source  income  of  a  nonresident individual. (a)
  General.  The New York source income of a nonresident  individual  shall
  be  the  sum  of  the  following: (1) The net amount of items of income,
  gain, loss and  deduction  entering  into  his  federal  adjusted  gross
  income,  as  defined  in  the  laws of the United States for the taxable
  year, derived from or connected with New York  sources,  including:  (A)
  his  distributive share of partnership income, gain, loss and deduction,
  determined under section six hundred thirty-two, and
    (B) his pro rata share of New York  S  corporation  income,  loss  and
  deduction, increased by reductions for taxes described in paragraphs two
  and three of subsection (f) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of the
  internal  revenue code, determined under section six hundred thirty-two,
  and
    (C) his share of estate or trust income,  gain,  loss  and  deduction,
  determined under section six hundred thirty-four and
    (2)  The portion of the modifications described in subsections (b) and
  (c) of section six hundred twelve which relate to  income  derived  from
  New  York  sources (including any modifications attributable to him as a
  partner or shareholder of a New York S corporation).
    (b) Income and deductions from New York sources.
    (1) Items  of  income,  gain,  loss  and  deduction  derived  from  or
  connected with New York sources shall be those items attributable to:
    (A)  the  ownership  of  any  interest  in  real  or tangible personal
  property in this state; or
    (1) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "real property located
  in this state" includes an interest in a partnership, limited  liability
  corporation,  S  corporation,  or non-publicly traded C corporation with
  one hundred or fewer shareholders (hereinafter the "entity")  that  owns
  real  property  that is located in New York or owns shares of stock in a
  cooperative housing corporation where the cooperative units relating  to
  the  shares  are located in New York; provided, that the sum of the fair
  market values of such real property,  cooperative  shares,  and  related
  cooperative  units  equals or exceeds fifty percent of all the assets of
  the entity on the date of sale or exchange of the taxpayer's interest in
  the entity. Only those assets that the entity owned  for  at  least  two
  years before the date of the sale or exchange of the taxpayer's interest
  in the entity are to be used in determining the fair market value of all
  the  assets  of  the entity on the date of sale or exchange. The gain or
  loss derived from New York sources from the taxpayer's sale or  exchange
  of  an  interest  in an entity that is subject to the provisions of this
  subparagraph is the total gain or loss for federal income  tax  purposes
  from  that  sale  or exchange multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
  which is the fair market value of the real property, and the cooperative
  housing corporation stock and related cooperative units located  in  New
  York on the date of sale or exchange and the denominator of which is the
  fair market value of all the assets of the entity on the date of sale or
  exchange.
    (B)  a  business,  trade,  profession or occupation carried on in this
  state; or
    (C) in the case of  a  shareholder  of  an  S  corporation  where  the
  election  provided for in subsection (a) of section six hundred sixty of
  this article is in effect,  the  ownership  of  shares  issued  by  such
  corporation,   to  the  extent  determined  under  section  six  hundred
  thirty-two of this article; or
    (D) winnings from a  wager  placed  in  a  lottery  conducted  by  the
  division  of  the  lottery,  if the proceeds from such wager exceed five
  thousand dollars; or


   (D-1) gambling winnings  in  excess  of  five  thousand  dollars  from
  wagering transactions within the state; or
    (E)  gains from the sale, conveyance or other disposition of shares of
  stock in a cooperative housing corporation in connection with the  grant
  or  transfer of a proprietary leasehold by the owner thereof and subject
  to the provisions of article thirty-one of this  chapter,  whether  such
  shares are held by a partnership, trust or otherwise; or
    (E-1)  in  the  case  of  an S corporation for which an election is in
  effect pursuant to subsection (a) of section six hundred sixty  of  this
  article  that  terminates  its taxable status in New York, any income or
  gain recognized on the receipt of  payments  from  an  installment  sale
  contract  entered  into when the S corporation was subject to tax in New
  York, allocated in a manner consistent with the applicable  methods  and
  rules for allocation under article nine-A or thirty-two of this chapter,
  in the year that the S corporation sold its assets.
    (F)  income  received  by  nonresidents  related to a business, trade,
  profession or occupation previously carried on in this state, whether or
  not as an employee, including but  not  limited  to,  covenants  not  to
  compete  and  termination  agreements.  Income  received by nonresidents
  related to  a  business,  trade,  profession  or  occupation  previously
  carried on partly within and partly without the state shall be allocated
  in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section.
    (2)  Income  from  intangible  personal property, including annuities,
  dividends, interest,  and  gains  from  the  disposition  of  intangible
  personal property, shall constitute income derived from New York sources
  only  to  the  extent  that  such  income is from property employed in a
  business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on in this  state  or
  from winnings from a wager placed in a lottery conducted by the division
  of  the  lottery,  if  the proceeds from such wager exceed five thousand
  dollars. Income from the disposition  of  intangible  personal  property
  shall also constitute income derived from New York sources to the extent
  such  gains are from the sale, conveyance or other disposition of shares
  of stock in a cooperative housing corporation  in  connection  with  the
  grant  or  transfer  of a proprietary leasehold by the owner thereof and
  subject to the provisions of article thirty-one of this chapter, whether
  such shares are held by a partnership, trust or otherwise.
    (3) Income directly or indirectly derived by an athlete,  entertainer,
  or   performing   artist   from   closed-circuit  and  cable  television
  transmissions of an event (other than events occurring  on  a  regularly
  scheduled  basis)  taking  place  within  the  state  as a result of the
  rendition of services by such athlete, entertainer or performing  artist
  shall constitute income derived from New York sources only to the extent
  that such transmissions were received or exhibited within the state.
    (4) Deductions with respect to capital losses, passive activity losses
  and net operating losses shall be based solely on income, gain, loss and
  deduction  derived  from  or  connected  with  New  York  sources, under
  regulations of the commissioner of taxation and finance,  but  otherwise
  shall  be  determined  in  the  same manner as the corresponding federal
  deductions.
    (5)  In  the  case  of  a  nonresident  individual  or  partner  of  a
  partnership  doing  an  insurance  business  as a member of the New York
  insurance exchange described in section six thousand two hundred one  of
  the  insurance  law, any item of income, gain, loss or deduction of such
  business which is the individual's distributive or pro  rata  share  for
  federal  income tax purposes or which the individual is required to take
  into account separately for  federal  income  tax  purposes,  shall  not
  constitute  income,  gain,  loss  or  deduction  derived  from  New York
  sources.


   (6) The deduction allowed  by  section  two  hundred  fifteen  of  the
  internal  revenue  code,  relating  to  alimony,  shall not constitute a
  deduction derived from New York sources.
    (c) Income and deductions partly from New York sources. If a business,
  trade,  profession  or occupation is carried on partly within and partly
  without  this  state,  as  determined  under  regulations  of  the   tax
  commission,  the  items of income, gain, loss and deduction derived from
  or connected with New York sources shall be determined by  apportionment
  and allocation under such regulations.
    (d)  Purchase  and sale for own account.-- A nonresident, other than a
  dealer holding property primarily for sale to customers in the  ordinary
  course  of  his  trade  or  business,  shall not be deemed to carry on a
  business, trade, profession or occupation in this state solely by reason
  of the purchase and sale of property or the purchase, sale or writing of
  stock option contracts, or both, for his own account.
    (e) Military pay. Compensation paid by the United  States  for  active
  service  in  the  armed  forces  of  the  United States, performed by an
  individual not domiciled in this  state,  shall  not  constitute  income
  derived from New York sources.
    (f)  Husband  and  wife.  If  husband and wife determine their federal
  income tax on a joint return but are required  to  determine  their  New
  York income taxes separately, they shall determine their New York source
  incomes  separately  as if their federal adjusted gross incomes had been
  determined separately.
    (g) Stock option grants,  stock  appreciation  rights  and  restricted
  stock.    A  nonresident  taxpayer  who has been granted statutory stock
  options,  restricted  stock,  nonstatutory  stock   options   or   stock
  appreciation rights and who, during such grant period, performs services
  within  New York for, or is employed within New York by, the corporation
  granting such option, stock or right, shall compute his or her New  York
  source  income  as  determined under rules and regulations prescribed by
  the commissioner.




   §   632.   Nonresident   partners   and  electing  shareholders  of  S
  corporations.  (a) Portion derived from New York sources.
    (1) In determining New York source income of a nonresident partner  of
  any  partnership,  there shall be included only the portion derived from
  or connected with New York sources of such partner's distributive  share
  of  items  of partnership income, gain, loss and deduction entering into
  his federal adjusted gross income, as such portion shall  be  determined
  under  regulations  of the tax commission consistent with the applicable
  rules of section six hundred thirty-one of this part. If  a  nonresident
  is a partner in a partnership where a sale or transfer of the membership
  interest  of  the  partner  is  subject  to  the  provisions  of section
  one-thousand  sixty  of  the  internal  revenue  code,  then  any   gain
  recognized on the sale or transfer for federal income tax purposes shall
  be  treated  as  New York source income allocated in a manner consistent
  with the applicable methods and rules for allocation under this  article
  in the year that the assets were sold or transferred.
    (2) In determining New York source income of a nonresident shareholder
  of an S corporation where the election provided for in subsection (a) of
  section  six  hundred sixty of this article is in effect, there shall be
  included only the portion  derived  from  or  connected  with  New  York
  sources  of  such shareholder's pro rata share of items of S corporation
  income, loss and deduction entering  into  his  federal  adjusted  gross
  income,  increased  by  reductions for taxes described in paragraphs two
  and three of subsection (f) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of the
  internal revenue  code,  as  such  portion  shall  be  determined  under
  regulations  of  the commissioner consistent with the applicable methods
  and  rules  for  allocation  under  article  nine-A  of  this   chapter,
  regardless  of  whether  or  not  such  item or reduction is included in
  entire  net  income  under  article  nine-A  for  the  tax  year.  If  a
  nonresident  is  a  shareholder  in  an S corporation where the election
  provided for in subsection (a) of section  six  hundred  sixty  of  this
  article  is  in  effect,  and  the  S  corporation  has  distributed  an
  installment  obligation  under  section  453(h)(1)(A)  of  the  Internal
  Revenue  Code,  then any gain recognized on the receipt of payments from
  the installment obligation for  federal  income  tax  purposes  will  be
  treated  as New York source income allocated in a manner consistent with
  the applicable methods and rules for allocation under article nine-A  of
  this  chapter in the year that the assets were sold. In addition, if the
  shareholders of the S corporation have made an  election  under  section
  338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code, then any gain recognized on the
  deemed asset sale for federal income tax purposes will be treated as New
  York  source income allocated in a manner consistent with the applicable
  methods and rules for allocation under article nine-A of this chapter in
  the year that the shareholder made the section 338(h)(10) election.  For
  purposes   of   a   section  338(h)(10)  election,  when  a  nonresident
  shareholder exchanges his or her S corporation  stock  as  part  of  the
  deemed  liquidation, any gain or loss recognized shall be treated as the
  disposition of an intangible asset and will not increase or  offset  any
  gain  recognized  on  the  deemed assets sale as a result of the section
  338(h)(10) election.
    (b) Special rules as to New York sources. In determining  the  sources
  of  a  nonresident  partner's  income,  no  effect  shall  be given to a
  provision in the partnership agreement which--
    (1) characterizes payments to the partner as being for services or for
  the use of capital, or
    (2) allocates to the partner, as income or gain from  sources  outside
  New  York, a greater proportion of his distributive share of partnership
  income or gain than the ratio of partnership income or gain from sources


 outside New York to partnership income or gain from all sources,  except
  as authorized in subsection (d), or
    (3)  allocates  to  the  partner a greater proportion of a partnership
  item of loss or deduction connected  with  New  York  sources  than  his
  proportionate  share,  for  federal  income tax purposes, of partnership
  loss or deduction generally, except as authorized in subsection (d).
    (c)  Partner's  and  shareholder's  modifications.  Any   modification
  described  in subsection (b) or (c) of section six hundred twelve, which
  relates to an item of partnership or S corporation income, gain, loss or
  deduction, shall be made in accordance with the  partner's  distributive
  share  or  the  shareholder's  pro  rata  share  for  federal income tax
  purposes of the item to which the modification relates, but  limited  to
  the  portion  of  such  item  derived  from  or  connected with New York
  sources.
    (d)  Alternate  methods.  The  tax  commission  may,  on  application,
  authorize  the  use  of  such other methods of determining a nonresident
  partner's portion of partnership items derived from  or  connected  with
  New  York  sources,  and  the  modifications  related thereto, as may be
  appropriate and equitable, on  such  terms  and  conditions  as  it  may
  require.
    (e)  Application  of  rules  for resident partners and shareholders to
  nonresident partners and shareholders.
    (1) A  nonresident  partner's  distributive  share  or  S  corporation
  shareholder's  pro  rata  share  of  items  shall  be  determined  under
  subsection (a) of section six hundred seventeen.
    (2)  The  character  of  partnership  or  corporation  items   for   a
  nonresident  partner  or  S  corporation shareholder shall be determined
  under subsection (b) of section six hundred seventeen.
    (3) The effect of a  special  provision  in  a  partnership  agreement
  (other  than  a provision referred to in subsection (b) of this section)
  having the principal purpose of avoidance or evasion of tax  under  this
  article  shall be determined under subsection (c) of section six hundred
  seventeen.




   §  632-a.  Personal  service corporations and S corporations formed or
  availed of to avoid or evade New York State income tax. (a) General.  If
  (1)  substantially all of the services of a personal service corporation
  or S corporation are performed for or on behalf of another  corporation,
  partnership,  or  other entity and (2) the effect of forming or availing
  of such personal service corporation or S corporation is  the  avoidance
  or  evasion  of New York income tax by reducing the income of, or in the
  case of a nonresident, reducing  the  New  York  source  income  of,  or
  securing  the  benefit  of any expense, deduction, credit, exclusion, or
  other allowance for, any employee-owner which  would  not  otherwise  be
  available,  then  the  commissioner may allocate all income, deductions,
  credits, exclusions, and other allowances between such personal  service
  corporation  or S corporation (even if such personal service corporation
  or S corporation is taxed under article nine-A of this chapter or is not
  subject to tax in this state) and  its  employee-owners,  provided  such
  allocation  is  necessary  to  prevent  avoidance or evasion of New York
  state income tax or to clearly reflect the source and the amount of  the
  income  of  the  personal service corporation or S corporation or any of
  its employee-owners.
    (b) Definitions for purposes of this section. (1) The  term  "personal
  service corporation" means a corporation whose principal activity is the
  performance  of  personal  services  and such services are substantially
  performed by the employee-owners of such corporation.
    (2) The term "S corporation" means a corporation for which an election
  under section 1362 of the internal revenue code is in  effect  for  such
  taxable year and whose principal activity is the performance of personal
  services   and   such   services  are  substantially  performed  by  the
  employee-owners of such corporation.
    (3) The term "employee-owner" means any  employee  who  owns,  on  any
  given  day  during  the  taxable  year,  more  than  ten  percent of the
  outstanding stock of the personal service corporation or S  corporation.
  For  purposes  of  the preceding sentence, the constructive ownership of
  stock rules set forth in section 318 of the internal revenue code  shall
  apply,  except that "5 percent" shall be substituted for "50 percent" in
  section 318(a)(2)(C) of the internal revenue code.
    (4) All related persons (within the meaning of  section  144(a)(3)  of
  the internal revenue code) shall be treated as one entity.




   §  633.  New  York source income of a nonresident estate or trust. (a)
  General. The New York source income of a  nonresident  estate  or  trust
  shall be the sum of the following:
    (1)  The  net  amount  of  items  of  income, gain, loss and deduction
  entering  into  federal  adjusted  gross  income,  as  determined  under
  paragraph  four  of  subsection  (e) of section six hundred one, derived
  from or connected with New York sources. Such  determination  of  source
  shall  be  made  in  accordance with the applicable rules of section six
  hundred thirty-one as in the case of a nonresident individual.
    (2) The portion of the modifications described in section six  hundred
  eighteen which relate to income derived from New York sources other than
  that  portion  of  the modification provided in subsection three thereof
  which relates to section six hundred fifteen.
    (b) Special New York source rules. Deductions with respect to  capital
  losses,  passive activity losses and net operating losses shall be based
  solely on income, gains, losses and deductions derived from or connected
  with New York sources, under regulations  of  the  tax  commission,  but
  otherwise  determined  in  the  same manner as the corresponding federal
  deductions.




   §  634.  Share  of  a  nonresident beneficiary in income from New York
  sources. (a) General. The share of  a  nonresident  beneficiary  of  any
  estate  or trust under subsection (a) of section six hundred thirty-one,
  in estate or trust income,  gain,  loss  and  deduction  from  New  York
  sources shall be determined as follows:
    (1)  Items  of  distributable net income from New York sources.  There
  shall be determined the items  of  income,  gain,  loss  and  deduction,
  derived  from  or  connected with New York sources, which enter into the
  definition of federal distributable net income of the  estate  or  trust
  for  the taxable year (including such items from another estate or trust
  of which the first estate or trust is a beneficiary). Such determination
  of source shall be made in  accordance  with  the  applicable  rules  of
  section  six  hundred  thirty-one  as  in  the  case  of  a  nonresident
  individual.
    (2) Addition or subtraction of modifications. There shall be added  or
  subtracted  (as  the case may be) the modifications described in section
  six hundred eighteen, to the extent relating to  the  items  of  income,
  gain, loss and deduction derived from or connected with New York sources
  as  determined  under  paragraph one of this subsection. No modification
  shall be made under this subsection which has the effect of  duplicating
  an item already reflected in the definition of federal distributable net
  income.
    (3)  Allocation  among beneficiaries. (A) The amounts determined under
  paragraphs one and two shall be allocated among the  beneficiaries  (and
  including,  solely  for the purpose of this allocation, among the estate
  or trust and resident beneficiaries) in proportion to  their  respective
  shares of federal distributable net income.
    (B)  The amounts so allocated shall have the same character under this
  article as for federal income tax purposes.  Where an item entering into
  the computation of such amounts is not characterized for federal  income
  tax  purposes,  it shall have the same character as if realized directly
  from the source from which realized by the estate or trust, or  incurred
  in the same manner as incurred by the estate or trust.
    (b) Alternate methods of determining shares.
    (1) If the estate or trust has no federal distributable net income for
  the  taxable  year, the share of each beneficiary (including, solely for
  the purpose of this  allocation,  resident  beneficiaries)  in  the  net
  amount  determined  under paragraphs one and two of subsection (a) shall
  be in proportion to the beneficiary's  share  of  the  estate  or  trust
  income for such year, under local law or the governing instrument, which
  is  required  to  be distributed currently and any other amounts of such
  income distributed in such year. Any balance of such net amount shall be
  allocated to the estate or trust.
    (2) The commissioner may by regulation establish such other method  or
  methods of determining the respective shares of the beneficiaries and of
  the  estate or trust in its income derived from New York sources, and in
  the modifications related thereto, as may be appropriate and  equitable.
  Such  method may be used by the fiduciary in his discretion whenever the
  allocation of such respective shares under subsection (a)  or  paragraph
  one  of  subsection (b) would result in an inequity which is substantial
  both in amount and in relation to the total amount of the  modifications
  referred to in paragraph two of subsection (a).




   §   635.   Credit   to   trust   beneficiary   receiving  accumulation
  distribution. A nonresident or part-year resident beneficiary of a trust
  whose New York source income includes all or  part  of  an  accumulation
  distribution by such trust, as defined in section six hundred sixty-five
  of  the internal revenue code, shall be allowed a credit against the tax
  otherwise due under this  article,  computed  in  the  same  manner  and
  subject  to  the  same  limitation  as  provided  by section six hundred
  twenty-one with respect to  a  resident  beneficiary  except  that  such
  limitation  shall be applied as if it also referred to an exclusion from
  New York source income.




   §  637.  Computation of separate tax on the ordinary income portion of
  lump sum distributions received by  nonresident  or  part-year  resident
  individuals,  estates  and  trusts.  (a)  General. The tax imposed under
  section six hundred three for any taxable  year,  with  respect  to  the
  ordinary  income  portion  of  a  lump  sum  distribution  received by a
  nonresident or part-year resident individual, estate or trust  shall  be
  applicable  to  the  ordinary  income portion of a lump sum distribution
  wholly or partly derived from or connected with New  York  sources,  and
  the  amount of such tax shall be computed in the same manner as that set
  forth in section six hundred twenty-four, except that if  the  lump  sum
  distribution was partly derived from or connected with New York sources,
  the total taxable amount and the ordinary income portion of the lump sum
  distribution  referred  to  in  such  section  shall  be  determined  by
  apportionment and allocation, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the
  state tax commission.
    (b) Special rule for part-year residents. In the case of  a  part-year
  resident,  the ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution wholly
  or partly derived from or connected with New York sources shall  be  the
  sum of:
    (1)  The  ordinary  income  portion of a lump sum distribution for the
  period of residence, computed as if the taxable year for federal  income
  tax purposes were limited to the period of residence.

  of accounting, accrue to the period of residence any  items  of  income,
  gain,  loss,  deduction,  or  ordinary  income  portion  of  a  lump sum
  distribution accruing prior to the change of status, with the applicable
  modifications and adjustments  to  federal  adjusted  gross  income  and
  itemized  deductions  under  sections six hundred twelve and six hundred
  fifteen, if not otherwise properly includible or allowable for New  York
  income  tax  purposes  for such period or a prior taxable year under his
  method of accounting.
    (b) If an individual changes status from nonresident  to  resident  he
  shall,  regardless  of his method of accounting, accrue to the period of
  nonresidence any items of income, gain, loss or deduction,  or  ordinary
  income  portion  of a lump sum distribution accruing prior to the change
  of status, with the applicable modifications and adjustments to  federal
  adjusted gross income and itemized deductions under sections six hundred
  twelve  and  six  hundred  fifteen,  other  than  items  derived from or
  connected with New York sources, if not otherwise properly includible or

    (c)  No item of income, gain, loss, deduction, ordinary income portion
  of a lump sum  distribution  or  modification  or  adjustment  which  is
  accrued  under  this  section shall be taken into account in determining
  the tax under this article for any subsequent taxable year.
    (d) The accruals under this section  shall  not  be  required  if  the
  individual  files  with  the  commissioner  a  bond  or  other  security
  acceptable to the commissioner, on condition that the amounts  accruable
  under  this  section are taken into account in determining the tax under
  this article for  one  or  more  subsequent  taxable  years  as  if  the
  individual had not changed his resident status.
    (e)  The  foregoing  provisions  of  this  section  shall  apply if an
  individual changes his or her status from a resident to  nonresident  or
  from  a  nonresident  to  resident  during  a  taxable  year,  or at the
  beginning of a taxable year, as a result of a change of domicile or as a
  result of becoming a resident or nonresident  based  on  the  definition
  contained in subsection (b) of section six hundred five of this article.
    (f)  Except  as  hereinafter  provided,  where  an individual who is a
  member of a partnership or a shareholder of  an  S  corporation  changes
  status  from  resident  to nonresident, or from nonresident to resident,
  the portion of the distributive or pro rata share of  income,  gain  and
  loss  (less  deductions  attributable  thereto)  from a partnership or S
  corporation shall be allocated to the resident and  nonresident  periods
  of  the  partner  or shareholder on a proportionate basis throughout the
  taxable year of the partnership or S corporation.  In  such  event,  the
  portion of the distributive or pro rata share allocated to the period of
  residency  shall  be determined based on the number of days of residency
  within the reporting period of the partnership or S corporation over the
  total number of days in the reporting period of  the  partnership  or  S
  corporation.  Provided,  however,  that the commissioner may require, or
  the individual may elect, to accrue to the period of residence, and  the
  period  of  nonresidence,  the  portion  of the distributive or pro rata
  share of partnership or  S  corporation  income,  gain  and  loss  (less
  deductions   attributable  thereto)  accruing  during  the  individual's
  respective resident and nonresident periods in a  manner  that  reflects
  the  date of accrual of said income, gain and loss by the partnership or
  S corporation.
    (g) Except  as  hereinafter  provided,  where  an  individual  who  is
  beneficiary  of  an  estate  or  trust  changes  status from resident to


 nonresident, or from nonresident to resident, the portion of any  estate
  or  trust  income  credited,  distributable,  payable  or required to be
  distributed to such beneficiary shall be allocated to the  resident  and
  nonresident   periods  of  the  beneficiary  on  a  proportionate  basis
  throughout the taxable year of the estate or trust. In such  event,  the
  portion  of  such  estate  or  trust  income  allocated to the period of
  residency shall be determined based on the number of days  of  residency
  within  the  reporting period of the estate or trust. Provided, however,
  that the commissioner may require, or  the  beneficiary  may  elect,  to
  accrue  to  the period of residence, and the period of nonresidence, the
  portion of such estate or trust income accruing during the beneficiary's
  respective resident and nonresident periods in a  manner  that  reflects
  the  date  of  accrual  of  said estate or trust income by the estate or
  trust.
    (h) If a trust changes its status from resident to nonresident or from
  nonresident to resident, the provisions of subsections (a)  through  (f)
  of  this  section shall apply except that the term "individual" shall be
  read as "trust"  and  reference  to  "modifications"  shall  mean  those
  modifications described in section six hundred eighteen.

  portion of which is subject to tax under section six hundred three;
    (2) every resident estate or trust required to file a  federal  income
  tax  return  for the taxable year, or having any New York taxable income

  portion of which is subject to tax under section six hundred three;
    (3) every nonresident or part-year resident individual having New York
  source income for the taxable year, determined under part  III  of  this
  article, and having New York adjusted gross income for the taxable year,
  determined  under  part  II of this article, in excess of the taxpayer's
  New York standard deduction, or having received during the taxable  year
  a  lump  sum  distribution  any portion of which is subject to tax under
  section six hundred three; and
    (4) every nonresident estate or  trust  or  part-year  resident  trust
  having  New  York  source  income for the taxable year, determined under
  part III of this article, and having New York adjusted gross income  for
  the  taxable  year, determined under paragraph four of subsection (e) of

  lump  sum  distribution  any  portion  of  which is subject to tax under
  section six hundred three.
    (b) Husband and wife.
    (1) If the  federal  income  tax  liability  of  husband  or  wife  is
  determined  on  a  separate  federal  return,  their New York income tax
  liabilities and returns shall be separate.
    (2) If the federal income tax liabilities of husband and  wife  (other
  than  a husband and wife described in paragraph four of this subsection)
  are determined on a joint federal return, they shall file  a  joint  New
  York  income  tax  return,  and their tax liabilities shall be joint and
  several except as provided in paragraph six of this subsection,  section
  six  hundred  fifty-four  and  subsection  (e)  of  section  six hundred
  eighty-five.
    (3) If neither husband or wife files a federal return:

  returns, in which event their tax liabilities shall be separate.
    (4) If either husband or wife  is  a  resident  and  the  other  is  a
  nonresident  or  part-year  resident,  they shall file separate New York
  income tax returns, in  which  event  their  tax  liabilities  shall  be
  separate,  unless  such husband and wife determine their federal taxable
  income jointly and both elect to determine their joint New York  taxable
  income  as  if both were residents, in which event their tax liabilities
  shall be joint and several except as provided in paragraph six  of  this
  subsection, section six hundred fifty-four and subsection (e) of section
  six hundred eighty-five.


   (6)  If  a  joint  return  has  been  made under this subsection for a
  taxable year and only one spouse is liable for past-due  support,  or  a
  past-due  legally  enforceable  debt,  or a city of New York tax warrant
  judgment debt, or an amount of a default in repayment  of  a  guaranteed
  student,   state  university  or  city  university  loan  of  which  the
  commissioner of taxation and  finance  has  been  notified  pursuant  to
  section  one  hundred  seventy-one-c,  one  hundred  seventy-one-d,  one
  hundred  seventy-one-e,  one  hundred  seventy-one-f,  or  one   hundred
  seventy-one-l  of  this chapter, as the case may be, then an overpayment
  and interest thereon shall be credited against such past-due support, or
  a past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York  tax  warrant
  judgment  debt, or such amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed
  student, state university or city university loan, unless the spouse not

  debt, or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or such amount of
  a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city
  university  loan  demands  on  a  declaration  made  in  accordance with
  regulations or instructions prescribed by the commissioner  of  taxation
  and   finance,   that  the  portion  of  the  overpayment  and  interest
  attributable to  such  spouse  not  be  credited  against  the  past-due
  support,  or  a past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York
  tax warrant judgment debt, or amount of a  default  in  repayment  of  a
  guaranteed student, state university or city university loan owed by the
  other spouse. Such demand may be filed (A) with the return of the spouse
  not liable for past-due support, or a past-due legally enforceable debt,
  or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or default in repayment
  of  a  guaranteed  student, state university, or city university loan or

  subdivision  seven  of  section  one  hundred seventy-one-e, subdivision
  seven of section one hundred seventy-one-f or subdivision six of section
  one  hundred  seventy-one-l  of  this  chapter.  Upon  such  demand  the
  commissioner  of  taxation and finance shall determine the amount of the
  overpayment attributable to each spouse in accordance  with  regulations
  prescribed  by  the commissioner of taxation and finance and credit only
  that portion of the overpayment and interest thereon attributable to the
  spouse liable for past-due support, or a  past-due  legally  enforceable
  debt,  or  a  city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or amount of a
  default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university  or  city
  university  loan  against  such  past-due support, or a past-due legally
  enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax warrant  judgment  debt,  or
  such  amount  of  a  default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state
  university or city university loan.
    (7) The commissioner shall clearly alert  married  taxpayers,  on  all
  appropriate  publications and instructions, that their liability for tax
  will be joint and several if they file joint  income  tax  returns.  The
  commissioner  shall  include  notice  of an individual's right to relief
  from joint  and  several  liability  pursuant  to  section  six  hundred
  fifty-four  of  this  article  in  the  disclosure  of  rights statement
  required by section three thousand four  of  this  chapter  and  in  any
  notice  regarding collection of tax due with respect to a liability on a
  joint return.
    (c) Decedents. The return for any deceased individual  shall  be  made
  and  filed  by  the  decedent's executor, administrator, or other person
  charged with the decedent's property. If a final return of a decedent is
  for a fractional part of a year, the due date of such  return  shall  be


 the  fifteenth  day  of  the  fourth  month  following  the close of the
  twelve-month period which began with the first day  of  such  fractional
  part  of the year. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary,
  when  a  return  has  been  filed  for  a decedent, the commissioner may
  disclose the decedent's name, address, and the  date  of  death  to  the
  director of real property tax services of the county and the assessor of
  the  assessing  unit  in  which  the  address reported on such return is
  located.
    (d) Individuals under a disability. The return for an  individual  who
  is  unable  to  make  a return by reason of minority or other disability
  shall be  made  and  filed  by  his  guardian,  conservator,  committee,
  fiduciary  or  other  person  charged  with  the  care  of his person or
  property (other than a receiver in possession of  only  a  part  of  his
  property), or by his duly authorized agent.
    (e)  Estates  and  trusts.  The return for an estate or trust shall be
  made and filed by the fiduciary.
    (f) Joint fiduciaries. If two or more fiduciaries are acting  jointly,
  the return may be made by any one of them.
    (g)   Nonresident   noncitizens.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of
  subsection (a) of this section, the due date for the filing of an income
  tax return under this article for the  taxable  year  by  a  nonresident
  noncitizen individual shall be the date prescribed for the filing of his
  or her federal income tax return for the taxable year.
    (h) Tax a debt. Any tax under this article, and any increase, interest
  or  penalty  thereon,  shall,  from the time it is due and payable, be a

  York.

  partnerships, employers and  other  persons,  see  section  six  hundred

  as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a person required to make
  and file a return under this article shall, without  assessment,  notice
  or  demand, pay any tax due thereon to the commissioner on or before the
  date fixed for filing such return  (determined  without  regard  to  any
  extension  of  time  for  filing  the  return).  The  commissioner shall
  prescribe by regulation the place for filing any return,  statement,  or
  other  document required pursuant to this article and for payment of any
  tax.
    (b) The commissioner may allow individuals who have income  only  from
  wages, salaries, tips and like remuneration for services performed as an
  employee,  interest, dividends and unemployment compensation to elect to
  have the commissioner compute the tax due. To  provide  for  expeditious
  and  uniform  administration  of  the  tax  computations  which  involve
  numerous variables, the commissioner may further qualify, with regard to
  period  of  residency,  deductions,  credits,  exemptions,  amount   and
  character of gross income, and any other appropriate factors relative to
  calculation  of tax, those individuals who may elect to have their taxes
  computed by the commissioner. Any such election shall  be  made  on  the
  form  prescribed  by  the  commissioner for this purpose. If a qualified
  taxpayer elects to have the commissioner compute  the  tax,  the  amount
  determined  by  the  commissioner shall be paid (i) within ten days from
  the date of the issuance of a notice and demand therefor or (ii) on  the
  date  fixed  for  filing  such  return (determined without regard to any
  extension of time for filing), whichever is later.




   §  653.  Signing  of returns and other documents. (a) General. (1) Any
  return, statement or other document required to be made pursuant to this
  article shall be signed in accordance with regulations  or  instructions
  prescribed  by  the  commissioner. The fact that an individual's name is
  signed to a return, statement, or other document, shall be  prima  facie
  evidence  for  all purposes that the return, statement or other document
  was actually signed by him or her.
    (b) Partnerships. Any return, statement or other document required  of
  a  partnership  shall be signed by one or more partners. The fact that a
  partner's name is signed to a  return,  statement,  or  other  document,
  shall  be  prima  facie  evidence  for all purposes that such partner is
  authorized to sign on behalf of the partnership.
    (c) Certifications. The making or filing of any return,  statement  or
  other  document or copy thereof required to be made or filed pursuant to
  this article, including a copy of a federal return, shall  constitute  a
  certification  by  the person making or filing such return, statement or
  other document or copy thereof that the statements contained therein are
  true and that any copy filed is a true copy.

  extent that any provision of such section is either inconsistent with or

  as  to  the  keeping  of  records,  the  content and form of returns and
  statements, and the filing of copies of federal income tax  returns  and
  determinations.     The  tax  commission  may  require  any  person,  by
  regulation or notice served upon such  person,  to  make  such  returns,
  render  such statements, or keep such records, as the tax commission may
  deem sufficient to show whether or not such person is liable under  this
  article  for  tax  or  for  collection  of tax. The tax commission shall

  securing his proper identification.
    (C)  Furnishing  number of another person.-- Any person required under
  the authority of this article to make  a  return,  statement,  or  other
  document  with  respect  to another person shall request from such other

  document,  such  identifying  number  as  may be prescribed for securing
  proper identification of such other person.
    (2) Limitation.--
    (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a  return  of  any  person
  with  respect  to  his  liability  for  tax,  or  any statement or other

  beneficiary of such estate or trust.
    (3) Requirement of information.-- For purposes of  this  section,  the
  tax  commission  is  authorized  to  require  such information as may be
  necessary to assign an identifying number to any person.
    (c) Partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations.
    (1) Partnerships. Every  partnership  having  a  resident  partner  or
  having   any  income  derived  from  New  York  sources,  determined  in
  accordance with the applicable rules of section six  hundred  thirty-one
  of this article as in the case of a nonresident individual, shall make a
  return  for  the  taxable  year setting forth all items of income, gain,
  loss  and  deduction  and  such  other  pertinent  information  as   the
  commissioner  may by regulations and instructions prescribe. Such return
  shall be filed on or before  the  fifteenth  day  of  the  fourth  month
  following  the  close  of each taxable year, for taxable years beginning
  before January first,  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  on  or  before  the
  fifteenth  day  of  the  third month following the close of each taxable
  year, for taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after  January  first,  two
  thousand  sixteen,  except  that  the  due  date  for  the  return  of a
  partnership consisting entirely of nonresident noncitizens shall be  the


 date prescribed for the filing of its federal partnership return for the
  taxable  year.  For  purposes  of this paragraph, "taxable year" means a
  year or a period which would be a taxable year of the partnership if  it
  were subject to tax under this article.
    (2)  S  corporations.  Every  S  corporation  for  which  the election
  provided for in subsection (a) of section six hundred sixty is in effect
  shall make a return for the taxable year  setting  forth  all  items  of
  income,  loss  and deduction and such other pertinent information as the
  commissioner of taxation and finance may by regulations and instructions
  prescribe. Such return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth day  of
  the third month following the close of each taxable year.
    (3)  Filing  fees.   (A) Every subchapter K limited liability company,
  every limited liability company that is a disregarded entity for federal
  income tax purposes, and every partnership which has any income  derived
  from  New  York  sources,  determined  in accordance with the applicable
  rules of section six hundred thirty-one of this article as in  the  case
  of a nonresident individual, shall on or before the fifteenth day of the
  third month following the close of each taxable year make a payment of a
  filing  fee.  The  amount  of  the filing fee is the amount set forth in
  subparagraph  (B)  of  this  paragraph.  The  minimum  filing   fee   is
  twenty-five  dollars  for  taxable years beginning in two thousand eight
  and  thereafter.  Limited  liability  companies  that  are   disregarded
  entities  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  must  pay a filing fee of
  twenty-five dollars for taxable years  beginning  on  or  after  January
  first, two thousand eight.
    (B)  The  filing fee will be based on the New York source gross income
  of the limited liability company or partnership  for  the  taxable  year
  immediately  preceding the taxable year for which the fee is due. If the
  limited liability company or partnership does  not  have  any  New  York
  source  gross  income  for  the  taxable  year immediately preceding the
  taxable year for which the fee is due, the limited liability company  or
  partnership  shall  pay the minimum filing fee. Partnerships, other than
  limited liability partnerships under article eight-B of the  partnership
  law  and  foreign  limited  liability  partnerships,  with less than one
  million dollars in New York source gross  income  are  exempt  from  the
  filing  fee. New York source gross income is the sum of the partners' or
  members' shares of federal gross income from the partnership or  limited
  liability  company  derived  from  or  connected  with New York sources,
  determined in accordance with the  provisions  of  section  six  hundred
  thirty-one  of  this  article  as  if  those  provisions and any related
  provisions expressly referred to a computation of federal  gross  income
  from  New  York  sources.  For  this  purpose,  federal  gross income is
  computed without any allowance or deduction for cost of goods sold.
    The amount of the filing fee for taxable years beginning on  or  after
  January  first, two thousand eight will be determined in accordance with
  the following table:
 
  If the New York source gross income is:         The fee is:
  not more than $100,000                          $25
  more than $100,000 but not over $250,000        $50
  more than $250,000 but not over $500,000        $175
  more than $500,000 but not over $1,000,000      $500
  more than $1,000,000 but not over $5,000,000    $1,500
  more than $5,000,000 but not over $25,000,000   $3,000
  Over $25,000,000                                $4,500
 
    (C) No credits provided by this article may be taken against  the  fee
  imposed by this paragraph.


   (D)  Where  the  filing  fee is not timely paid, it shall be paid upon
  notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the  same
  manner as taxes, and for those purposes any reference in this article to
  tax imposed by this article shall be deemed also to refer to this filing
  fee.
    (E)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subsection (e) of section six
  hundred ninety-seven of this article, the commissioner shall provide the
  statements and other required information included  on  the  filing  fee
  payment  form  under  section three hundred one of the limited liability
  company law, subdivision (g) of section 121-1500 of the partnership law,
  and subdivision (f) of section 121-1502 of the partnership law,  to  the
  secretary of state for filing. Such provision may also include a copy or
  image of that portion of the report solely pertinent to such information
  to the extent feasible. The commissioner may also provide information on
  noncompliance.
    (4)  Estimated  tax of nonresident partners, members and shareholders.
  (A) General. Every entity which is a partnership, other than a  publicly
  traded  partnership  as  defined in section 7704 of the federal Internal
  Revenue Code, subchapter K limited liability company or an S corporation
  for which the election provided for in subsection  (a)  of  section  six
  hundred  sixty of this part is in effect, which has partners, members or
  shareholders  who  are  nonresident  individuals,   as   defined   under
  subsection  (b)  of  section  six  hundred  five  of  this article, or C
  corporations, and which has any income derived from  New  York  sources,
  determined  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  rules  of section six
  hundred thirty-one of this article as  in  the  case  of  a  nonresident
  individual,  shall  pay  estimated  tax on such income on behalf of such
  partners, members or  shareholders  in  the  manner  and  at  the  times
  prescribed  by subsection (c) of section six hundred eighty-five of this
  article. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "estimated tax"  shall
  mean  a  partner's,  member's or shareholder's distributive share or pro
  rata  share  of  the  entity  income  derived  from  New  York  sources,
  multiplied  by the highest rate of tax prescribed by section six hundred
  one of this article for the taxable  year  of  any  partner,  member  or
  shareholder   who  is  an  individual  taxpayer,  or  paragraph  (a)  of
  subdivision one of section two hundred  ten  of  this  chapter  for  the
  taxable  year  of  any  partner,  member  or  shareholder  which  is a C
  corporation, whether or not such C corporation is subject to  tax  under
  article nine, nine-A or thirty-three of this chapter, and reduced by the
  distributive  share  or  pro  rata share of any credits determined under
  section  one  hundred  eighty-seven,  one  hundred  eighty-seven-a,  six
  hundred  six  or  fifteen  hundred  eleven of this chapter, whichever is
  applicable, derived from the entity.
    (B) Treatment of  payment.  Any  payment  by  the  entity  under  this
  paragraph  with  respect  to  a partner, member or shareholder who is an
  individual shall be deemed to be a  payment  of  estimated  tax  by  the
  partner, member or shareholder pursuant to subsection (c) of section six
  hundred eighty-five of this article.
    (C)  Additions  to tax. (i) If an entity required by this paragraph to
  pay estimated tax on behalf of a partner, member or shareholder fails to
  do so, such entity shall pay a penalty of fifty dollars  for  each  such
  failure for each such partner, member or shareholder, unless it is shown
  that  such  failure  is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful
  neglect.
    (ii) In the case of an underpayment of estimated tax  by  the  entity,
  there  shall  be  added  to the estimated tax required to be paid by the
  entity under this paragraph, an amount determined pursuant to subsection
  (c) of section six hundred eighty-five of this article.


   (D) Exceptions. (i) This paragraph shall not apply with respect  to  a
  partner,  member  or  shareholder  for whom estimated tax required to be
  paid under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for the  taxable  year  of
  the  partner,  member  or  shareholder  does  not  exceed  three hundred
  dollars.
    (ii)  This  paragraph  shall  not  apply  with respect to any partner,
  member or shareholder if the entity is authorized by the commissioner to
  file a group return and such partner, member or shareholder has  elected
  to  be included on the group return, or if the commissioner has issued a
  waiver of withholding pursuant to this  section.  The  commissioner  may
  issue  such  waivers in respect of partners, members or shareholders who
  are not subject to New York income tax, or who establish that  they  are
  filing  New York income tax returns and paying estimated taxes when due,
  and in other circumstances in which  the  commissioner  determines  that
  withholding  is  not necessary to ensure collection of income tax on New
  York source income allocable to the nonresident or C corporation.
    (E) Information statements. Every entity required under this paragraph
  to pay estimated taxes for any of its partners, members or  shareholders
  shall  furnish,  within thirty days after such estimated tax is paid, to
  each such partner, member or shareholder a written statement showing the
  estimated taxes paid by the entity on behalf of such partner, member  or
  shareholder  and any other information the commissioner shall prescribe,
  including any information necessary to identify each partner, member  or
  shareholder  on  whose  behalf  the entity has paid estimated taxes. The
  entity shall  provide  to  the  commissioner  information  necessary  to
  identify  the  estimated tax paid by the entity for each partner, member
  or shareholder and  information  necessary  to  identify  each  partner,
  member or shareholder of the partnership, limited liability company or S
  corporation,  whether  or  not  estimated tax was paid for such partner,
  member or shareholder by the entity, at such times and in such manner as
  the commissioner shall prescribe.
    (d) Information at source.   (1)  The  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance  may prescribe regulations and instructions requiring returns of
  information to be made and filed on or before February twenty-eighth  of
  each year as to the payment or crediting in any calendar year of amounts
  of  six hundred dollars or more to any taxpayer under this article. Such
  returns may be required of any person, including lessees  or  mortgagors
  of  real  or personal property, fiduciaries, employers, and all officers
  and employees  of  this  state,  or  of  any  municipal  corporation  or
  political  subdivision  of  this  state,  having  the  control, receipt,
  custody, disposal  or  payment  of  interest,  rents,  salaries,  wages,
  premiums,  annuities,  compensations, remunerations, emoluments or other
  fixed or determinable gains, profits or income, except interest  coupons
  payable  to  bearer.  Information  required  to be furnished pursuant to
  paragraph four of subsection (a) of section six hundred seventy-four  on
  a quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return covering each
  calendar quarter of each year and relating to tax withheld on wages paid
  by  an  employer  to  an  employee  for  each  calendar  quarter,  shall
  constitute the return of information required  to  be  made  under  this
  section with respect to such wages.
    (2)   (A)   The  commissioner  shall  be  authorized  to  require,  by
  regulation, that any or all of the returns of information referred to in
  paragraph one of this subsection, the  quarterly  combined  withholding,
  wage  reporting and unemployment insurance returns required by paragraph
  four of subsection (a) of  section  six  hundred  seventy-four  and  the
  reports required by section one hundred seventy-one-h of this chapter be
  filed  on  magnetic  media  or  in  other  machine  readable  form. Such
  regulations shall conform, to the extent practicable, with corresponding


 federal  regulations  and  instructions  promulgated  pursuant  to   the
  authority of section six thousand eleven of the federal Internal Revenue
  Code.  Any  person  required  to  file  two hundred fifty or more of the
  returns  referred to in paragraph one of this subsection may be required
  to file such returns on magnetic media or in other machine readable form
  pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.
    (B) A  filer  may  seek  exemption  from  the  magnetic  media  filing
  requirement  for  a  particular  period,  if  the  filer  proves  to the
  satisfaction of the commissioner of taxation and finance that imposition
  of such a requirement for that period would result  in  undue  hardship.
  The  commissioner shall take into account (among other relevant factors)
  the ability of the filer to comply at reasonable cost with such a filing
  requirement.
    (C) The regulations provided for in this paragraph  may  include,  but
  shall not be limited to, the following:
    (i)  a description of the kinds of magnetic media which can be used to
  satisfy the filing requirement;
    (ii) a description of the kinds of returns and classes of filers to be
  subject to the magnetic media or  other  machine  readable  form  filing
  requirement; and
    (iii)  procedures governing the voluntary submission by magnetic media
  or other machine readable form of all or  any  portion  of  the  returns
  described in this paragraph.
    (3)  The  commissioner  may  by  regulation or instruction require the
  filing of a report annually by the comptroller or program manager of the
  New  York  state  college  choice  tuition  savings  program,  or  their
  designee,  setting forth the names and identification numbers of account
  owners, designated beneficiaries  and  distributees  of  family  tuition
  accounts,   the  amounts  contributed  to  such  accounts,  the  amounts
  distributed from such accounts and the nature of such  distributions  as
  qualified   withdrawals   or   as   withdrawals   other  than  qualified
  withdrawals, and any such other  information  as  the  commissioner  may
  require regarding the taxation under this article of amounts contributed
  to  or  withdrawn  from such accounts. The commissioner may require that
  any  such  report  also  be  made  to  the  account  owner,   designated
  beneficiary or distributee of any such account.
    (e)  Notice of qualification as receiver, etc. Every receiver, trustee
  in  bankruptcy,  assignee  for  benefit  of  creditors,  or  other  like
  fiduciary  shall  give  notice  of  his qualification as such to the tax
  commission, as may be required by regulation.
    (f) (1) Every trust described by subparagraph (D) of  paragraph  three
  of subsection (b) of section six hundred five of this article shall make
  a  return  for  any  taxable  year  in  which  it  makes an accumulation
  distribution within the  meaning  of  subdivision  (b)  of  section  six
  hundred  sixty-five of the internal revenue code to a beneficiary who is
  a resident, which return shall include (i) information identifying  such
  resident,  (ii)  the amount of such accumulation distribution, and (iii)
  such other information as the commissioner may require.  In  determining
  whether there has been an accumulation distribution for purposes of this
  paragraph,  such trust shall exclude distributions from income earned by
  the trust prior to the beneficiary's  birth  or  attaining  the  age  of
  twenty-one.
    (2)  Every  resident  trust  that does not file the return required by
  section six hundred fifty-one of this part on the ground that it is  not
  subject  to  tax  pursuant  to  subparagraph  (D)  of paragraph three of
  subsection (b) of section six hundred  five  of  this  article  for  the
  taxable  year  shall  make a return for such taxable year substantiating


 its entitlement to that exemption and providing such  other  information
  as the commissioner may require.
    (3)  The  returns  required  by  this  subsection shall be filed on or
  before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of each
  taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph,  "taxable  year"  means  a
  year  or  a period which would be a taxable year of the trust if it were
  subject to tax under this article.
    (g) Requirements applicable to tax return preparer.
    (1) Signature of tax return preparer. Any  individual  who  is  a  tax
  return  preparer and prepares any return or claim for refund, shall sign
  such return or claim  for  refund  in  accordance  with  regulations  or
  instructions prescribed by the commissioner.
    (2)  Furnishing  identifying  numbers.  Any return or claim for refund
  which is prepared by a tax return preparer shall include the identifying
  number of the preparer required by paragraph one of this  subsection  to
  sign such return or claim for refund. In addition, where such individual
  preparer  is  an  employee of an employer which is a tax return preparer
  with respect to such return or claim for refund, or where such  preparer
  is  a  partner  in  a  partnership  which  is a tax return preparer with
  respect to such return or claim for refund, then such  return  or  claim
  for refund shall also include the identifying number of such employer or
  partnership.  Such  identifying  numbers  shall  be as prescribed by the
  commissioner in order  to  secure  the  proper  identification  of  such
  individual preparer, partnership or employer. The responsibility for the
  inclusion of such identifying numbers shall be as set forth in paragraph
  two  of  subsection  (u)  of  section  six  hundred  eighty-five of this
  article.
    (3) Furnishing copy to taxpayer.  Any  person  who  is  a  tax  return
  preparer  with respect to any return or claim for refund shall furnish a
  completed copy of such return or claim for refund to  the  taxpayer  not
  later  than  the  time  such return or claim for refund is presented for
  such taxpayer's signature.
    (4) Copy or list to be retained by tax return preparer. Any person who
  is a tax return preparer with respect to any return or claim for  refund
  shall  for  a three year retention period described in paragraph nine of
  this subsection:
    (A) retain a completed copy of such return or  claim  for  refund,  or
  retain,  on  a  list, the name and identification number of the taxpayer
  for whom such return or claim was prepared, and
    (B) make such copy or list available for inspection  upon  request  by
  the commissioner.
    (5)  Tax  return  preparer  defined. For purposes of this article, the
  term  "tax  return  preparer"  means  any  person   who   prepares   for
  compensation,  or  who employs or engages one or more persons to prepare
  for compensation any return or claim for refund. The  preparation  of  a
  substantial  portion of a return or claim for refund shall be treated as
  if it were the preparation of such return or claim for refund. Where  an
  employer  and  one  or  more  employees  of such employer are tax return
  preparers with respect to the same return or claim for refund, or  where
  a  partnership  and  one  or  more  partners in such partnership are tax
  return preparers with respect to the same return or  claim  for  refund,
  for  purposes  of  paragraphs  three  and  four of this subsection, such
  employer or such partnership shall be deemed to be the sole  tax  return
  preparer.  A  person shall not be a "tax return preparer" merely because
  such person--
    (A) furnishes typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance,


   (B) prepares a return or claim for refund of the employer  (or  of  an
  officer  or  employee  of  the  employer)  by  whom  he is regularly and
  continuously employed, or
    (C)  prepares  as  a  fiduciary  a  return or claim for refund for any
  person.
    (6) Person defined. For purposes of this subsection, the term "person"
  includes an individual, corporation (including a dissolved  corporation)
  or partnership.
    (7) Return defined. For purposes of this subsection, the term "return"
  shall mean any return required under this article.
    (8)  Claim  for  refund  defined. For purposes of this subsection, the
  term "claim for refund" shall mean a  claim  for  refund  of  or  credit
  against  any tax imposed under this article, and shall include any claim
  for refund of any credit treated as an overpayment  of  tax  under  this
  article.
    (9)  Retention  period  defined.  For purposes of this subsection, the
  term "retention period" shall mean:
    (A) in the case of a tax return, the period ending the later of  three
  years  after  the due date of such return (without regard to extensions)
  or three years after the date such return was presented to the  taxpayer
  for such taxpayer's signature, and
    (B)  in  the case of a claim for refund, the period ending three years
  after such claim for refund was  presented  to  the  taxpayer  for  such
  taxpayer's signature.
    * (10)  Mandatory  electronic  filing by certain tax return preparers.
  (A)(i) If a tax return preparer prepared more than two hundred  original
  returns  during  the  calendar  year  beginning  on  January  first, two
  thousand five, and if, in the calendar year beginning on January  first,
  two  thousand  six,  such  tax  return  preparer  prepares  one  or more
  authorized returns using tax software, then, for such calendar year  two
  thousand  six  and  for  each  subsequent  calendar year thereafter, all
  authorized returns prepared by such tax return preparer shall  be  filed
  electronically,  in  accordance  with  instructions  prescribed  by  the
  commissioner.
    (ii) If a tax return preparer prepared more than one hundred  original
  returns  during  any  calendar year beginning on or after January first,
  two thousand six, and if, in  any  succeeding  calendar  year  such  tax
  return  preparer  prepares  one  or  more  authorized  returns using tax
  software,  then,  for  such  succeeding  calendar  year  and  for   each
  subsequent  calendar year thereafter, all authorized returns prepared by
  such tax return preparer shall be filed  electronically,  in  accordance
  with instructions prescribed by the commissioner.
    (B) For purposes of this paragraph:
    (i)  "Electronic"  means  computer technology; provided, however, that
  the commissioner may, in  instructions,  provide  that  use  of  barcode
  technology   will   also   satisfy   the   mandatory  electronic  filing
  requirements of this section.
    (ii) "Authorized return" means any return required under this  article
  which the commissioner has authorized to be filed electronically.
    (iii)  "Original  return"  means  a return required under this article
  that is filed, without regard to extensions, during  the  calendar  year
  for which that return is required to be filed.
    (iv)  "Tax  software" means any computer software program intended for
  tax return preparation purposes.

   § 659. Report of federal changes, corrections or disallowances. If the
  amount  of  a taxpayer's federal taxable income, total taxable amount or
  ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution or includible gain of
  a trust reported on his federal income tax return for any taxable  year,
  or  the  amount  of  a  taxpayer's  earned  income  credit or credit for
  employment-related expenses set forth on such return, or the  amount  of
  any  federal  foreign tax credit affecting the calculation of the credit
  for Canadian provincial taxes under section six hundred  twenty  or  six
  hundred  twenty-A  of  this article, or the amount of any claim of right
  adjustment, is changed  or  corrected  by  the  United  States  internal
  revenue  service  or  other  competent  authority  or as the result of a
  renegotiation of a contract or subcontract with the  United  States,  or
  the amount an employer is required to deduct and withhold from wages for
  federal  income tax withholding purposes is changed or corrected by such
  service or authority or if a taxpayer's claim for credit  or  refund  of
  federal  income  tax  is disallowed in whole or in part, the taxpayer or
  employer shall report such change or correction or  disallowance  within
  ninety  days  after  the final determination of such change, correction,
  renegotiation  or  disallowance,  or  as  otherwise  required   by   the
  commissioner,  and  shall  concede the accuracy of such determination or
  state wherein it is erroneous. The allowance of  a  tentative  carryback
  adjustment based upon a net operating loss carryback pursuant to section
  sixty-four  hundred eleven of the internal revenue code shall be treated
  as a final determination for purposes  of  this  section.  Any  taxpayer
  filing  an  amended federal income tax return and any employer filing an
  amended federal return of income tax withheld  shall  also  file  within
  ninety  days  thereafter an amended return under this article, and shall
  give such information as the commissioner may require. The  commissioner
  may  by regulation prescribe such exceptions to the requirements of this
  section as he or she deems appropriate. For purposes  of  this  section,
  (i)  the  term  "taxpayer" shall include a partnership having a resident
  partner or having any income  derived  from  New  York  sources,  and  a
  corporation  with  respect  to  which  the  taxable year of such change,
  correction, disallowance or amendment is a year with  respect  to  which
  the election provided for in subsection (a) of section six hundred sixty
  of  this  article  is  in  effect, and (ii) the term "federal income tax
  return" shall include the returns of income required under sections  six
  thousand  thirty-one  and  six  thousand  thirty-seven  of  the internal
  revenue code. In the case of such a corporation, such report shall  also
  include  any  change  or correction of the taxes described in paragraphs
  two and three of subsection (f) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of
  the internal  revenue  code.  Reports  made  under  this  section  by  a
  partnership  or  corporation shall indicate the portion of the change in
  each item of income, gain, loss or deduction (and,  in  the  case  of  a
  corporation, of each change in, or disallowance of a claim for credit or
  refund  of,  a  tax  referred to in the preceding sentence) allocable to
  each partner  or  shareholder  and  shall  set  forth  such  identifying
  information  with  respect  to  such  partner  or  shareholder as may be
  prescribed by the commissioner.




   § 660. Election by shareholders of S corporations.  (a) Election. If a
  corporation  is  an  eligible  S  corporation,  the  shareholders of the
  corporation may elect in the manner set forth in subsection (b) of  this
  section to take into account, to the extent provided for in this article
  (or  in  article  thirteen of this chapter, in the case of a shareholder
  which is a taxpayer under such article),  the  S  corporation  items  of
  income, loss, deduction and reductions for taxes described in paragraphs
  two and three of subsection (f) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of
  the  internal  revenue  code  which  are  taken into account for federal
  income tax purposes  for  the  taxable  year.  No  election  under  this
  subsection shall be effective unless all shareholders of the corporation
  have so elected. An eligible S corporation is (i) an S corporation which
  is  subject  to  tax  under article nine-A of this chapter, or (ii) an S
  corporation which is the parent of a qualified subchapter  S  subsidiary
  subject  to  tax  under  article  nine-A, where the shareholders of such
  parent  corporation  are  entitled  to  make  the  election  under  this
  subsection   by  reason  of  subparagraph  three  of  paragraph  (k)  of
  subdivision nine of section two hundred eight of this chapter.
    (b) Requirements of election. An election under subsection (a) of this
  section shall be made on such  form  and  in  such  manner  as  the  tax
  commission may prescribe by regulation or instruction.
    (1) When made. An election under subsection (a) of this section may be
  made at any time during the preceding taxable year of the corporation or
  at  any time during the taxable year of the corporation and on or before
  the fifteenth day of the third month of such taxable year.
    (2) Certain elections made during first two and one-half months. If an
  election made under subsection (a) of  this  section  is  made  for  any
  taxable  year  of  the corporation during such year and on or before the
  fifteenth day of the third month of such year, such  election  shall  be
  treated as made for the following taxable year if
    (A)  on  one or more days in such taxable year before the day on which
  the election was made the corporation did not meet the  requirements  of
  subsection  (b)  of  section  thirteen hundred sixty-one of the internal
  revenue code or
    (B) one or more of the shareholders who held stock in the  corporation
  during  such  taxable  year  and  before  the  election was made did not
  consent to the election.
    (3) Elections made after first two and one-half months. If an election
  under subsection (a) of this section is made for any taxable year of the
  corporation and such election is made after the  fifteenth  day  of  the
  third  month  of such taxable year and on or before the fifteenth day of
  the third month of the following taxable year, such  election  shall  be
  treated as made for the following taxable year.
    (4)  Taxable years of two and one-half months or less. For purposes of
  this subsection, an election for a taxable year made not later than  two
  months and fifteen days after the first day of the taxable year shall be
  treated as timely made during such year.
    (5)  Authority  to  treat  late  elections, etc., as timely. If (A) an
  election under subsection (a) of this section is made  for  any  taxable
  year  (determined  without regard to paragraph three of this subsection)
  after the date prescribed by this subsection for  making  such  election
  for  such  taxable  year, or if no such election is made for any taxable
  year, and
    (B) the commissioner determines that there was  reasonable  cause  for
  failure to timely make such election, then
    (C)  the  commissioner  may  treat such an election as timely made for
  such taxable year (and paragraph three  of  this  subsection  shall  not
  apply).


   (6)  Years  for  which  effective. An election under subsection (a) of
  this section shall be effective for the taxable year of the  corporation
  for  which  it  is  made  and  for  all  succeeding taxable years of the
  corporation until such election is terminated under  subsection  (c)  of
  this section.
    (c)  Termination.  An  election  under  subsection (a) of this section
  shall cease to be effective
    (1) on the day an election  to  be  an  S  corporation  ceases  to  be
  effective  for federal income tax purposes pursuant to subsection (d) of
  section thirteen hundred sixty-two of the internal revenue code, or
    (2) if shareholders holding more than one-half of the shares of  stock
  of  the  corporation  on  the day on which the revocation is made revoke
  such election  in  the  manner  the  tax  commission  may  prescribe  by
  regulation,
    (A)  on  the  first day of the taxable year of the corporation, if the
  revocation is made during  such  taxable  year  and  on  or  before  the
  fifteenth day of the third month thereof, or
    (B) on the first day of the following taxable year of the corporation,
  if  the  revocation  is  made  during  the  taxable  year  but after the
  fifteenth day of the third month thereof, or
    (C) on and after the date so specified, if the revocation specifies  a
  date for revocation which is on or after the day on which the revocation
  is made, or
    (3)  if any person who was not a shareholder of the corporation on the
  day on  which  the  election  is  made  becomes  a  shareholder  in  the
  corporation and affirmatively refuses to consent to such election in the
  manner  the  tax commission may prescribe by regulation, on the day such
  person becomes a shareholder.
    (d) New York S  termination  year.  In  the  case  of  a  New  York  S
  termination  year,  the amount of any item of S corporation income, loss
  and deduction and reductions for taxes (as described in  paragraphs  two
  and three of subsection (f) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of the
  internal  revenue  code)  required  to  be  taken  account of under this
  article shall be adjusted in the same manner that  the  S  corporation's
  items  which  are  included  in the shareholder's federal adjusted gross
  income are adjusted under subsection (s) of section six hundred twelve.
    (e) Inadvertent invalid elections. If (1) an election under subsection
  (a) of this section was not effective for the  taxable  year  for  which
  made  (determined  without  regard to paragraph two of subsection (b) of
  this section) by reason of a failure to obtain shareholder consents,
    (2) the commissioner determines that the  circumstances  resulting  in
  such ineffectiveness were inadvertent,
    (3)  no  later than a reasonable period of time after discovery of the
  circumstances resulting in such ineffectiveness,  steps  were  taken  to
  acquire the required shareholder consents, and
    (4)  the  corporation,  and  each  person who was a shareholder in the
  corporation at any time during the period  specified  pursuant  to  this
  subsection,  agrees  to  make  such  adjustments  (consistent  with  the
  treatment of the corporation as a New York  S  corporation)  as  may  be
  required by the commissioner with respect to such period,
    (5)   then,   notwithstanding  the  circumstances  resulting  in  such
  ineffectiveness, such corporation shall be  treated  as  a  New  York  S
  corporation during the period specified by the commissioner.
    (f)  Validated  federal elections. If (1) an election under subsection
  (a) of this  section  was  made  for  a  taxable  year  or  years  of  a
  corporation,  which  years occur with or within the period for which the
  federal S election of such corporation has been  validated  pursuant  to


 the  provisions  of subsection (f) of section thirteen hundred sixty-two
  of the internal revenue code, and
    (2)  the  corporation,  and  each  person who was a shareholder in the
  corporation at any time during such taxable year or years agrees to make
  such adjustments (consistent with the treatment of the corporation as  a
  New  York  S  corporation)  as  may be required by the commissioner with
  respect to such year or years,
    (3) then such corporation shall be treated as a New York S corporation
  during such year or years.
    (g) Transitional rule. Any election made under  this  section  (as  in
  effect  for  taxable  years  beginning  before  January  first, nineteen
  hundred eighty-three)  shall  be  treated  as  an  election  made  under
  subsection (a) of this section.
    (h)  Cross  reference. For definitions relating to S corporations, see
  subdivision one-A of section two hundred eight of this chapter.
    (i) Mandated New York S corporation election.  (1) Notwithstanding the
  provisions in subsection (a) of this section, in the case of an eligible
  S corporation for which  the  election  under  subsection  (a)  of  this
  section  is not in effect for the current taxable year, the shareholders
  of an eligible S corporation are  deemed  to  have  made  that  election
  effective  for the eligible S corporation's entire current taxable year,
  if the eligible  S  corporation's  investment  income  for  the  current
  taxable  year is more than fifty percent of its federal gross income for
  such year. In determining whether an eligible S corporation is deemed to
  have made  that  election,  the  income  of  a  qualified  subchapter  S
  subsidiary  owned  directly  or indirectly by the eligible S corporation
  shall be included with the income of the eligible S corporation.
    (2) For  the  purposes  of  this  subsection,  the  term  "eligible  S
  corporation"  has  the  same  definition  as  in  subsection (a) of this
  section.
    (3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term "investment  income"
  means the sum of an eligible S corporation's gross income from interest,
  dividends,  royalties,  annuities, rents and gains derived from dealings
  in property, including the corporation's share  of  such  items  from  a
  partnership,  estate  or  trust,  to  the  extent  such  items  would be
  includable in federal gross income for the taxable year.
    (4)  Estimated  tax  payments.  When  making  estimated  tax  payments
  required  to  be  made  under  this chapter in the current tax year, the
  eligible S corporation and its shareholders may rely on the  eligible  S
  corporation's  filing  status  for  the  prior  year.  If the eligible S
  corporation's  filing  status  changes  from  the  prior  tax  year  the
  corporation  or  the  shareholders,  as  the case may be, which made the
  payments shall be entitled to a refund of such estimated  tax  payments.
  No  additions  to  tax  with  respect  to  any  required declarations or
  payments of estimated tax imposed under this chapter shall be imposed on
  the corporation or shareholders,  whichever  is  the  taxpayer  for  the
  current  taxable  year, if the corporation or the shareholders file such
  declarations and make such estimated tax payments by  January  fifteenth
  of the following calendar year, regardless of whether the taxpayer's tax
  year is a calendar or a fiscal year.
   §  661.  Change of election. Any election expressly authorized by this
  article may  be  changed  on  such  terms  and  conditions  as  the  tax
  commission may prescribe by regulation.




   §  662.  Computation of tax where taxpayer restores substantial amount
  held under claim of right. (a) General.  If:
    (1) an item was included in New York adjusted gross income for a prior
  taxable year (or years) because it appeared that  the  taxpayer  had  an
  unrestricted right to such item, and
    (2)   for the current taxable year the provisions of paragraph five of
  subsection (a) of section thirteen hundred  forty-one  of  the  internal
  revenue  code  apply  to such item, then the tax imposed by this article
  for the taxable year shall be an amount equal to
    (3)  the tax for the taxable year  computed  without  regard  to  this
  section, minus
    (4)  the decrease in tax under this article for the prior taxable year
  (or years) which would result solely from the exclusion of such item (or
  portion  thereof)  from  New  York  adjusted gross income for such prior
  taxable year (or years).
    (b)   Special rules. (1) If the  decrease  in  tax  ascertained  under
  paragraph four of subsection (a) of this section exceeds the tax imposed
  by  this article for the taxable year, such excess shall be considered a
  payment of tax on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of  tax
  for  the  taxable  year,  and  shall be refunded or credited in the same
  manner as if it were an overpayment for such taxable year.
    (2)   Nonresidents  and  part-year  residents.    In  the  case  of  a
  nonresident  or  part-year  resident,  the exclusion of an item from New
  York adjusted gross income for a  prior  taxable  year  beginning  after
  nineteen  hundred eighty-seven under paragraph four of subsection (a) of
  this section shall also be reflected, as appropriate, in  the  New  York
  source fraction.




   §  663.  Estimated  tax  on  sale  or  transfer  of  real  property by
  nonresident.  (a) Upon the sale of real property within the state  by  a
  nonresident taxpayer, the nonresident shall estimate the personal income
  tax  liability  on  the  gain,  if  any,  from such sale or transfer. In
  addition, upon the sale, conveyance or other disposition  of  shares  of
  stock  in  a  cooperative  housing  corporation  in  connection with the
  transfer of a proprietary leasehold by the owner thereof and subject  to
  the  provisions  of  article thirty-one of this chapter, the nonresident
  shall estimate the personal income tax liability on the  gain,  if  any,
  from such sale, conveyance or other disposition.
    (b)  Such  estimation  shall  be  done  upon  a form prescribed by the
  commissioner, utilizing an estimated tax rate equal to the highest  rate
  of tax for the taxable year set forth in section six hundred one of this
  article.
    (c) This section shall not apply where:
    (1)  The  real  property  being  sold  or  transferred  is a principal
  residence of the seller or transferor within the meaning of section  121
  of the Internal Revenue Code;
    (2)  The  seller  or transferor is a mortgagor conveying the mortgaged
  property to a mortgagee in foreclosure or  in  a  transfer  in  lieu  of
  foreclosure with no additional consideration; or
    (3)  The  transferor  or  transferee  is an agency or authority of the
  United States of America, an agency or authority of  the  state  of  New
  York,  the  Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan
  Mortgage Corporation, or the Government National  Mortgage  Association,
  or a private mortgage insurance company; or
    (4) The proprietary leasehold being transferred in connection with the
  sale,  conveyance  or  other  disposition  of  the  shares of stock in a
  cooperative housing corporation is a principal residence of  the  seller
  or  transferor within the meaning of section 121 of the Internal Revenue
  Code;
    (d) A recording officer shall not record or accept for  recording  any
  deed unless one of the following conditions is satisfied:
    (1)  it  is  accompanied  by  a  receipt  issued  by  the commissioner
  indicating that the estimated tax required by this section has been paid
  to the commissioner either electronically or as otherwise prescribed  by
  him or her;
    (2)  it  is  accompanied  by  a  form  prescribed  by the commissioner
  pursuant to subsection (b) of  this  section  and  the  payment  of  any
  estimated tax shown as payable on such form; or
    (3)  such  receipt  or form includes a certification by the transferor
  that this section is inapplicable to the sale or transfer.
    (e) Every recording officer shall act as an agent of the  commissioner
  for  purposes  of  collecting the estimated personal income tax, if any,
  shown to be payable upon the form prescribed pursuant to subsection  (b)
  of this section. The commissioner, by regulation, shall prescribe one or
  more  methods  for  the recording officer's collection of such estimated
  tax. Every recording officer shall remit to the commissioner  any  funds
  collected  and  any returns filed with such recording officer under this
  section on such  days  as  the  commissioner  shall  set  by  regulation
  consistent  with  the provisions of section fourteen hundred ten of this
  chapter for the remission of the tax imposed under article thirty-one of
  this chapter. Every recording officer also shall follow such  procedures
  and  keep  such records in respect to the implementation of this section
  as the commissioner may prescribe.
    (f) A recording officer shall not be liable under this section for any
  inaccuracy  in  any  statement  on  the  form  prescribed  pursuant   to
  subsection  (b)  of  this section or in the amount of estimated personal


 income tax he or she shall collect under this section so long as  he  or
  she  shall collect the estimated personal income tax shown as payable on
  such form.
    (g) If a deed is recorded notwithstanding an omission or inaccuracy in
  the form prescribed pursuant to subsection (b) of this section or in any
  certification  by  the  transferor  on  such form or a deficiency in the
  payment of estimated personal income tax required by this  section,  the
  record of such deed shall not be invalidated by reason of such omission,
  inaccuracy,  erroneous  certification  or deficiency nor shall the title
  founded on such deed be impaired thereby.
    (h)  The  commissioner  shall   promulgate   rules   and   regulations
  implementing this section.
    (i)  The  estimated personal income tax liability on the gain, if any,
  from the sale, conveyance or other disposition of shares of stock  in  a
  cooperative  housing  corporation  shall  be paid to the commissioner no
  later than the fifteenth  day  after  the  delivery  of  the  instrument
  affecting  such  sale,  conveyance or other disposition. For purposes of
  this section, the date of the instrument affecting such sale, conveyance
  or other disposition shall be presumed to be the  date  of  delivery  of
  such instrument.




   §  671.  Requirement  of withholding tax from wages. (a) General.  (1)
  Every employer maintaining an office or transacting business within this
  state and making payment of any wages taxable under this  article  shall
  deduct  and  withhold  from  such  wages  for  each payroll period a tax
  computed in such  manner  as  to  result,  so  far  as  practicable,  in
  withholding  from  the  employee's  wages  during  each calendar year an
  amount substantially equivalent to the tax reasonably  estimated  to  be
  due  under  this  article resulting from the inclusion in the employee's
  New York adjusted  gross  income  or  New  York  source  income  of  the
  employee's  wages  received  during  such  calendar  year. The method of
  determining the amount  to  be  withheld  shall  be  prescribed  by  the
  commissioner,  with due regard to the New York withholding exemptions of
  the employee and the sum of any credits allowable against the employee's
  tax. The commissioner shall  publish  any  changes  to  such  method  of
  determining  the  amount  of  tax  to  be withheld on the website of the
  department of taxation and finance. The commissioner  shall  also  cause
  notice  of such changes to be published in the section for miscellaneous
  notices in the state register and shall give other  appropriate  general
  notice of such changes.
    (2) The tax commission may provide, by regulations, for withholding--
    (A)  from  remuneration  for services performed by an employee for his
  employer which does not constitute wages, and
    (B) from any other type of payment, with  respect  to  which  the  tax
  commission  finds  that  withholding  would  be  appropriate  under  the
  provisions of this article,
  if the employer and the employee, or in the case of any  other  type  of
  payment the person making and the person receiving the payment, agree to
  such  withholding.  Such agreement shall be made in such form and manner
  as the tax commission may by regulations provide. For purposes  of  this
  article,  remuneration  or  other  payments  with  respect to which such
  agreement is made shall be treated as if they  were  wages  paid  by  an
  employer  to an employee to the extent that such remuneration is paid or
  other payments are made during the period for which the agreement is  in
  effect.
    (3)  The  tax  commission shall provide by regulation for an exemption
  from withholding for (i) employees under eighteen  years  of  age,  (ii)
  employees  under twenty-five years of age who are full-time students and
  (iii) employees over sixty-five years of age,  provided  such  employees
  had  no  income  tax  liability  in  the  prior  year and can reasonably
  anticipate none in the current year.
    * (b) Extension  of  withholding  to  certain  periodic  payments  and
  gambling winnings.
    (1)  For purposes of this article, any payment subject to withholding,
  within the meaning of paragraph two of this subsection, shall be treated
  as if it were wages paid by an employer to an employee.

  this subsection, a payment subject to withholding means:

  adjusted gross income or New York source income.

  termination.  Such a request for withholding or statement of termination
  shall take effect in such manner as the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance shall prescribe.
    (B)  Withholding  on  lottery  winnings upon change of residence. If a
  payee of lottery winnings subject to the provisions of subparagraph  (D)

  lottery winnings by the division of the lottery,  if  at  the  time  the
  payment  is  made  a  request  that  such lottery winnings be subject to
  withholding under this article is in effect, shall be treated as  if  it
  were  a  payment  of  wages  by an employer to an employee for a payroll
  period.
    (2) Request for withholding.--A request that an annuity be subject  to
  withholding  under this article shall be made by the payee in writing to
  the person making the annuity  payments,  and  a  request  that  lottery
  winnings  be  subject to withholding under this article shall be made by
  the payee in writing to the division  of  the  lottery,  in  the  manner
  prescribed  by  the commissioner of taxation and finance. A request that
  an annuity be subject to withholding may, notwithstanding any  provision
  of law to the contrary, be terminated by furnishing to the person making
  the  payments a written statement of termination. A request that lottery
  winnings be subject to withholding  under  this  article  shall  not  be
  revocable  while  the payee is a nonresident, and shall constitute other
  security  acceptable  to  the  tax  commission  within  the  meaning  of
  paragraph  four  of  subsection (c) of section six hundred fifty-four of
  this article. Such a request for withholding or statement of termination
  shall take effect in such manner as the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance shall provide by regulation.
    * NB Effective per ch. 782/88 § 8
    (c) Withholding exemptions. For purposes of this section:
    (1)  The  number  of New York withholding exemptions which an employee
  receiving wages taxable under this article may claim  shall  not  exceed
  the  number of New York exemptions allowed pursuant to the provisions of
  section six hundred sixteen and such  additional  New  York  withholding


 exemptions  as  may  be prescribed by regulations or instructions of the
  commissioner of taxation and finance, taking into account the applicable
  standard deduction and such other factors as he finds appropriate.
    (2)  The  amount  of  each New York withholding exemption shall be the
  amount of the New York exemption allowed pursuant to the  provisions  of
  section six hundred sixteen.
    (3)  Withholding  exemption certificate. An employee shall be required
  to file with his employer a withholding exemption certificate in  accor-
  dance with regulations or instructions prescribed by the commissioner of
  taxation and finance.




   §  672. Information statement for employee. Every employer required to
  deduct and withhold  tax  under  this  article  from  the  wages  of  an
  employee,  or who would have been required so to deduct and withhold tax
  if the employee had claimed no  more  than  one  withholding  exemption,
  shall furnish to each such employee in respect of the wages paid by such
  employer to such employee during the calendar year on or before February
  fifteenth  of  the  succeeding year, or, if his employment is terminated
  before the close of such calendar year, within thirty days from the date
  on which the last payment of the wages is made, a written  statement  as
  prescribed by the tax commission showing the amount of wages paid by the
  employer  to  the employee, the amount deducted and withheld as tax, and
  such other information as the tax commission shall prescribe.




   § 673. Credit for tax withheld. Wages upon which tax is required to be
  withheld  shall  be taxable under this article as if no withholding were
  required, but any amount of tax actually  deducted  and  withheld  under
  this  article  in any calendar year shall be deemed to have been paid to
  the tax commission on behalf of the person from whom withheld, and  such
  person  shall  be  credited  with having paid that amount of tax for the
  taxable year beginning in such calendar year. For a taxable year of less
  than twelve months, the credit shall be made under  regulations  of  the
  tax commission.




   §  674.  Employer's return and payment of withheld taxes. (a) General.
  Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax  under  this  article
  shall file a withholding return and pay over to the tax commission or to
  a  depositary designated by the tax commission, the taxes so required to
  be deducted and withheld, as hereafter prescribed.
    (1) If, after having made a payroll, an employer has been required  to
  deduct  and  withhold,  but  has  not  paid over, a cumulative aggregate
  amount of seven hundred  dollars  or  more  of  tax  during  a  calendar
  quarter,  such  employer shall file a return and pay over the tax. If an
  employer was required to remit a cumulative  aggregate  amount  of  less
  than  fifteen  thousand  dollars  in withholding tax during the calendar
  year which precedes the previous calendar year, the tax  shall  be  paid
  over  on  or  before the fifth business day following the date of making
  such a payroll. If an  employer  was  required  to  remit  a  cumulative
  aggregate  amount  more  than  or  equal  to fifteen thousand dollars in
  withholding tax during the calendar year  which  precedes  the  previous
  calendar  year,  the  tax  shall  be  paid  over  on or before the third
  business day following the date of making such a payroll. In the case of
  an "educational organization" as defined in paragraph two of  subsection
  (a)  of  section  nine  of  this  chapter or a "health care provider" as
  defined in paragraph four of subsection (a)  of  section  nine  of  this
  chapter,  the tax shall be paid over on or before the fifth business day
  following the date of making such a payroll.
    (2) If, at the close of any calendar quarter,  an  employer  has  been
  required  to  deduct  and  withhold, but has not paid over, a cumulative
  aggregate amount of less than seven hundred dollars of tax  during  such
  calendar  quarter,  such  employer  shall  pay  over  the  tax  with the
  quarterly  combined  withholding,  wage   reporting   and   unemployment
  insurance return required to be filed for such quarter by paragraph four
  of  this  subsection,  on  or  before  the  last date prescribed by such
  paragraph for filing such return.
    (3) If an employer makes more than one payroll  per  week,  then  such
  employer  shall  determine  the  applicability of the rules described in
  paragraphs one and two of this subsection measured by the  last  payroll
  made  within  the  week by such employer; provided, however, that in any
  week in which the end of a quarter occurs between the making of payrolls
  by an employer, any tax required  to  be  deducted  and  withheld  in  a
  payroll  or payrolls made during such week prior to or on the end of the
  quarter shall be paid over. If an  employer  was  required  to  remit  a
  cumulative  aggregate  amount  of  less than fifteen thousand dollars in
  withholding tax during the calendar year  which  precedes  the  previous
  calendar  year,  the  tax  shall  be  paid  over  on or before the fifth
  business day following the date of  making  the  last  payroll  in  such
  quarter.  If  an  employer  was required to remit a cumulative aggregate
  amount more than or equal to fifteen thousand dollars in withholding tax
  during the calendar year which precedes the previous calendar year,  the
  tax shall be paid over on or before the third business day following the
  date  of  making  the  last  payroll  in such quarter. In the case of an
  "educational organization" as defined in paragraph two of subsection (a)
  of section nine of this chapter or a "health care provider"  as  defined
  in paragraph four of subsection (a) of section nine of this chapter, the
  tax shall be paid over on or before the fifth business day following the
  date  of making such a payroll. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
  "week" shall mean the period Sunday through Saturday.
    (4) (A) All employers described in paragraph one of subsection (a)  of
  section  six  hundred  seventy-one  of  this part, including those whose
  wages paid are not sufficient to require the withholding of tax from the
  wages of any of their employees, all employers required to  provide  the


 wage  reporting  information  for the employees described in subdivision
  one of section one  hundred  seventy-one-a  of  this  chapter,  and  all
  employers   liable  for  unemployment  insurance  contributions  or  for
  payments  in  lieu of such contributions pursuant to article eighteen of
  the labor  law,  shall  file  a  quarterly  combined  withholding,  wage
  reporting  and  unemployment  insurance  return  detailing the preceding
  calendar quarter's withholding tax  transactions,  such  quarter's  wage
  reporting   information,   such   quarter's  withholding  reconciliation
  information, such quarter's unemployment  insurance  contributions,  and
  such  other  related  information  as  the  commissioner of taxation and
  finance or the commissioner of labor, as applicable, may prescribe. Such
  returns shall be filed no later than the last day of the month following
  the last day of each calendar quarter.
    (B) An employer shall, at the time prescribed by subparagraph  (A)  of
  this  paragraph  for  filing  each  quarterly combined withholding, wage
  reporting and unemployment insurance  return,  pay  over,  in  a  single
  remittance,  the  unemployment  insurance  contributions  and  aggregate
  withholding  taxes  required  to  be  paid  over   with   such   return.
  Notwithstanding  any provision of law to the contrary, an overpayment of
  unemployment insurance contributions or of aggregate  withholding  taxes
  made  by  an  employer  with  the  quarterly  combined withholding, wage
  reporting and unemployment insurance return for a calendar  quarter  may
  be  only credited by such employer against such employer's liability for
  unemployment insurance contributions  or  aggregate  withholding  taxes,
  respectively.
    (C)  The  provisions  of article eighteen of the labor law relating to
  administration of the state's unemployment insurance program shall apply
  to the department's duties under this chapter relating  to  unemployment
  insurance information, contributions and payments.
    (5)  The  tax commission may, if it believes such action necessary for
  the protection of the revenues, require any employer to make such return
  and pay to it the tax deducted and withheld at any time, or from time to
  time.
    (6) Each employer in the construction  classification  as  defined  in
  section  one  hundred seventy-one-j of this chapter, shall submit to the
  commissioner  quarterly,  with  such   employer's   quarterly   combined
  withholding  and  wage  reporting  return,  information  relating to the
  aggregate numbers of hours worked by all such employees of such employer
  on a quarterly basis, and the geographic location or locations in  which
  such  employees  worked  during  each quarter. Such information shall be
  reported in such form as the commissioner shall prescribe.
    (b) Deposit in trust for tax commission. Whenever any  employer  fails
  to collect, truthfully account for, pay over the tax, or make returns of
  the  tax  as  required  in  this section, the tax commission may serve a
  notice requiring  such  employer  to  collect  the  taxes  which  become
  collectible  after  service  of  such notice, to deposit such taxes in a
  bank approved by the tax commission, in a separate account, in trust for
  and payable to the tax commission, and to keep the amount of such tax in
  such account until payment over to the tax commission. Such notice shall
  remain in effect until a notice of cancellation is  served  by  the  tax
  commission.


   §  675.  Employer's  liability  for  withheld  taxes.--Every  employer
  required to deduct and withhold tax under this article  is  hereby  made
  liable  for  such  tax.  For  purposes of assessment and collection, any
  amount required to be withheld and paid over to the tax commission,  and
  any additions to tax, penalties and interest with respect thereto, shall
  be  considered  the  tax  of  the  employer.  Any amount of tax actually
  deducted and withheld under this article shall be held to be  a  special
  fund  in  trust for the tax commission. No employee shall have any right
  of action against his employer in respect to  any  moneys  deducted  and
  withheld  from  his  wages  and  paid  over  to  the  tax  commission in
  compliance or in intended compliance with this article.




   §  676. Employer's failure to withhold. If an employer fails to deduct
  and withhold tax as required, and thereafter the tax against which  such
  tax  may  be  credited  is  paid, the tax so required to be deducted and
  withheld shall not be collected from  the  employer,  but  the  employer
  shall  not  be  relieved  from liability for any penalties, interest, or
  additions to the tax otherwise applicable in respect of such failure  to
  deduct and withhold.




   §  677.  Designation  of  third  parties  to  perform acts required of
  employers.--In case a fiduciary, agent, or other person has the control,
  receipt, custody, or disposal of, or pays the wages of  an  employee  or
  group  of  employees,  employed  by  one  or  more  employers,  the  tax
  commission, under  regulations  promulgated  by  it,  is  authorized  to
  designate such fiduciary, agent, or other person to perform such acts as
  are  required  of employers under this article and as the tax commission
  may  specify.  Except  as  may  be  otherwise  prescribed  by  the   tax
  commission,  all  provisions  of law (including penalties) applicable in
  respect of an employer shall be applicable to  a  fiduciary,  agent,  or
  other  person so designated but, except as so provided, the employer for
  whom such fiduciary, agent, or other person acts shall remain subject to
  the provisions of law (including penalties)  applicable  in  respect  of
  employers.




   §  678. Liability of third parties paying or providing for wages.--(a)
  Direct payment by third party.--If a lender, surety or other person, who
  is not an employer with respect to an employee or  group  of  employees,
  pays  wages directly to such an employee or group of employees, employed
  by one or more employers, or to an agent on behalf of such  employee  or
  employees,  such  lender, surety or other person shall be liable for the
  amount of taxes (together with interest) required  to  be  deducted  and
  withheld from such wages by the employer.
    (b)  Funds supplied to employer by third parties.--If a lender, surety
  or other person supplies funds to or for the account of an employer  for
  the  specific purpose of paying wages of the employees of such employer,
  with actual notice or knowledge that such employer does not intend to or
  will not be able to make timely payment or deposit of the amounts of tax
  required by this article to be deducted and withheld  by  such  employer
  from such wages, such lender, surety or other person shall be liable for
  the amount of the taxes (together with interest) which are not paid over
  to  the  tax  commission  by  such  employer with respect to such wages.
  However, the liability of such lender, surety or other person  shall  be
  limited  to  an  amount  equal  to  twenty-five percent of the amount so
  supplied to or for the account of such employer for such purpose.
    (c) Effect  of  payment.--Any  amounts  paid  to  the  tax  commission
  pursuant  to this section shall be credited against the liability of the
  employer.




   §  681.  Notice of deficiency.--(a) General.--If upon examination of a
  taxpayer's return under this article the tax commission determines  that
  there  is a deficiency of income tax, it may mail a notice of deficiency
  to the taxpayer. If a taxpayer  fails  to  file  an  income  tax  return
  required  under  this  article,  the  tax  commission  is  authorized to
  estimate the taxpayer's New York taxable income and  tax  thereon,  from
  any information in its possession, and to mail a notice of deficiency to
  the  taxpayer.  A  notice  of deficiency shall be mailed by certified or
  registered mail to the taxpayer at his last known address in or  out  of
  this  state.  If a husband and wife are jointly liable for tax, a notice
  of deficiency may be a single joint  notice,  except  that  if  the  tax
  commission  has  been notified by either spouse that separate residences
  have been established, then, in lieu  of  the  single  joint  notice,  a
  duplicate original of the joint notice shall be mailed to each spouse at
  his  or  her last known address in or out of this state. If the taxpayer
  is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of deficiency  may  be
  mailed to his last known address in or out of this state, unless the tax
  commission   has  received  notice  of  the  existence  of  a  fiduciary
  relationship with respect to the taxpayer.
    (b) Notice of deficiency as assessment.--After ninety  days  from  the
  mailing of a notice of deficiency, such notice shall be an assessment of
  the  amount of tax specified in such notice, together with the interest,
  additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice,  except  only  for
  any  such  tax or other amounts as to which the taxpayer has within such
  ninety day period filed with the tax commission a petition under section
  six hundred eighty-nine. If the notice of deficiency is addressed  to  a
  person  outside  of  the United States, such period shall be one hundred
  fifty days instead of ninety days.
    (c)  Restrictions  on  assessment  and  levy.--No  assessment   of   a
  deficiency  in tax and no levy or proceeding in court for its collection
  shall be made, begun or prosecuted,  except  as  otherwise  provided  in
  section  six  hundred ninety-four, until a notice of deficiency has been
  mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of the time for  filing
  a  petition  contesting  such notice, nor, if a petition with respect to
  the taxable year has been filed  with  the  tax  commission,  until  the
  decision  of  the  tax commission has become final. For exception in the
  case of judicial review of the  decision  of  the  tax  commission,  see
  subsection (c) of section six hundred ninety.
    (d) Exceptions for mathematical or clerical errors.--If a mathematical
  or clerical error appears on a return (including an overstatement of the
  credit  for  income tax withheld at the source, or of the amount paid as
  estimated income tax), the commissioner shall notify the  taxpayer  that
  an  amount  of  tax  in excess of that shown upon the return is due, and
  that such excess has been assessed. Such notice shall not be  considered
  as  a  notice of deficiency for the purposes of this section, subsection
  (f) of section six hundred eighty-seven  (limiting  credits  or  refunds
  after  petition  to  the  division  of  tax  appeals), subsection (b) of
  section six hundred eighty-nine (authorizing the filing  of  a  petition
  with  the  division  of tax appeals based on a notice of deficiency), or
  article forty of this chapter, nor shall such assessment  or  collection
  be prohibited by the provisions of subsection (c).
    (e) Exceptions where federal changes, corrections or disallowances are
  not reported.---
    (1)  If  the  taxpayer  or  employer  fails to comply with section six
  hundred fifty-nine, instead of the mode and time of assessment  provided
  for  in  subsection (b) of this section, the tax commission may assess a
  deficiency based upon such federal change, correction or disallowance by
  mailing to the taxpayer a notice of additional tax  due  specifying  the


 amount  of  the  deficiency,  and  such  deficiency,  together  with the
  interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice, shall be
  deemed assessed on the date such notice is mailed unless  within  thirty
  days  after  the  mailing of such notice a report of the federal change,
  correction or disallowance or an amended return, where such  return  was
  required  by  section  six hundred fifty-nine, is filed accompanied by a
  statement showing wherein such federal determination and such notice  of
  additional tax due are erroneous.
    (2)  Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for
  the purposes of this section, subsection  (f)  of  section  six  hundred
  eighty-seven  (limiting  credits  or  refunds  after petition to the tax
  commission), or  subsection  (b)  of  section  six  hundred  eighty-nine
  (authorizing the filing of a petition with the tax commission based on a
  notice  of  deficiency),  nor  shall  such  assessment or the collection
  thereof be prohibited by the provisions of subsection (c).
    (3) If a husband and wife are jointly liable  for  tax,  a  notice  of
  additional  tax due may be a single joint notice, except that if the tax
  commission has been notified by either spouse that  separate  residences
  have  been  established,  then, in lieu of the joint notice, a duplicate
  original of the joint notice shall be mailed to each spouse  at  his  or
  her  last  known  address  in  or  out of this state. If the taxpayer is
  deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of additional tax due may
  be mailed to his last known address in or out of this state, unless  the
  tax  commission  has  received  notice  of  the existence of a fiduciary
  relationship with respect to the taxpayer.
    (f) Waiver of restrictions.--The taxpayer shall at any  time  (whether
  or  not  a notice of deficiency has been issued) have the right to waive
  the restrictions on assessment and collection of the whole or  any  part
  of  the  deficiency  by  a  signed  notice in writing filed with the tax
  commission.
    (g) Deficiency defined.--For purposes of this  article,  a  deficiency
  means the amount of the tax imposed by this article, less (i) the amount
  shown as the tax upon the taxpayer's return (whether the return was made
  or  the tax computed by him or by the tax commission), and less (ii) the
  amounts previously assessed  (or  collected  without  assessment)  as  a
  deficiency  and plus (iii) the amount of any rebates. For the purpose of
  this definition, the tax imposed by this article and the  tax  shown  on
  the  return  shall  both  be  determined  without  regard to payments on
  account of estimated tax or the credit for withholding tax; and a rebate
  means so much  of  an  abatement,  credit,  refund  or  other  repayment
  (whether  or not erroneous) made on the ground that the amounts entering
  into the definition of a deficiency showed a balance  in  favor  of  the
  taxpayer.




   §  682.  Assessment.-- (a) Assessment date.--The amount of tax which a
  return shows to be due, or the amount of tax which a return  would  have
  shown  to  be  due  but  for  a mathematical or clerical error, shall be
  deemed to be assessed on the date of filing of the return (including any
  amended return showing an increase of tax). In  the  case  of  a  return
  properly  filed  without  computation  of  tax,  the tax computed by the
  commissioner shall be deemed to be assessed on the date on which payment
  is due. If a notice of deficiency has been mailed,  the  amount  of  the
  deficiency  shall  be  deemed  to  be  assessed on the date specified in
  subsection (b) of section six hundred eighty-one if no petition  to  the
  division  of  tax appeals is filed, or if a petition is filed, then upon
  the date when a determination or decision rendered in  the  division  of
  tax  appeals establishing the amount of the deficiency becomes final. If
  an amended return or  report  filed  pursuant  to  section  six  hundred
  fifty-nine  concedes the accuracy of a federal change or correction, any
  deficiency in tax under this article resulting therefrom shall be deemed
  to be assessed on the date of filing such report or amended return,  and
  such  assessment  shall  be  timely  notwithstanding section six hundred
  eighty-three. If a notice  of  additional  tax  due,  as  prescribed  in
  subsection  (e)  of section six hundred eighty-one, has been mailed, the
  amount of the deficiency shall be deemed to  be  assessed  on  the  date
  specified in such subsection unless within thirty days after the mailing
  of  such  notice  a  report  of  the  federal change or correction or an
  amended return, where such return was required by  section  six  hundred
  fifty-nine,  is  filed  accompanied  by a statement showing wherein such
  federal  determination  and  such  notice  of  additional  tax  due  are
  erroneous.  Any  amount paid as a tax or in respect of a tax, other than
  amounts withheld at the source or paid as estimated income tax, shall be
  deemed  to  be  assessed  upon  the  date   of   receipt   of   payment,
  notwithstanding any other provisions.
    (b)  Other  assessment powers.--If the mode or time for the assessment
  of any tax under this article (including interest, additions to tax  and
  assessable  penalties) is not otherwise provided for, the tax commission
  may establish the same by regulations.
    (c) Estimated income tax.--No unpaid amount of estimated tax shall  be
  assessed.
    (d)  Supplemental  assessment.--The  tax  commission  may, at any time
  within  the  period  prescribed  for  assessment,  make  a  supplemental
  assessment,  subject to the provisions of section six hundred eighty-one
  where applicable, whenever it is  ascertained  that  any  assessment  is
  imperfect or incomplete in any material respect.
    (e)  Cross reference.--For assessment in case of jeopardy, see section
  six hundred ninety-four.




   §  683.  Limitations on assessment.--(a) General.--Except as otherwise
  provided in this section, any tax under this article shall  be  assessed
  within  three  years  after  the  return  was filed (whether or not such
  return was filed on or after the date prescribed).
    (b) Time return deemed filed.--
    (1) Early return.--For purposes of this section  a  return  of  income
  tax, except withholding tax, filed before the last day prescribed by law
  or  by  regulations  promulgated pursuant to law for the filing thereof,
  shall be deemed to be filed on such last day.
    (2) Return of withholding tax.--For purposes of  this  section,  if  a
  return  of  withholding  tax  for  any  period  ending  with or within a
  calendar year is filed before April fifteenth of the succeeding calendar
  year, such return shall be deemed to be filed on April fifteenth of such
  succeeding calendar year.
    (c) Exceptions.--
    (1) Assessment at any time.--The tax may be assessed at any time if--
    (A) no return is filed,
    (B) a false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to evade tax, or
    (C) the taxpayer or employer fails to comply with section six  hundred
  fifty-nine.
    (2)  Extension by agreement.--Where, before the expiration of the time
  prescribed in this section for the  assessment  of  tax,  both  the  tax
  commission  and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment
  after such time, the tax may be  assessed  at  any  time  prior  to  the
  expiration  of  the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be
  extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the  expiration
  of the period previously agreed upon.
    (3)  Report  of federal changes, corrections or disallowances.--If the
  taxpayer or employer complies with section six hundred  fifty-nine,  the
  assessment  (if  not  deemed  to  have  been made upon the filing of the
  report or amended return) may be made at any time within two years after
  such report or amended return was filed. The amount of  such  assessment
  of  tax  shall  not  exceed  the  amount of the increase in New York tax
  attributable to such federal change or  correction.  The  provisions  of
  this  paragraph shall not affect the time within which or the amount for
  which an assessment may otherwise be made.
    (4) Deficiency attributable to net  operating  loss  carryback.--If  a
  deficiency  is  attributable to the application to the taxpayer of a net
  operating loss carryback,  it  may  be  assessed  at  any  time  that  a
  deficiency for the taxable year of the loss may be assessed.
    (5)  Recovery  of  erroneous  refund.--An  erroneous  refund  shall be
  considered an underpayment of tax on the date made, and an assessment of
  a deficiency arising out of an erroneous refund may be made at any  time
  within  two  years  from  the  making  of  the  refund,  except that the
  assessment may be made within five years from the making of  the  refund
  if  it  appears  that  any  part  of  the refund was induced by fraud or
  misrepresentation of a material fact.

    (12)   Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  paragraph  three  of  this
  subsection, or as otherwise provided in  this  section  where  a  longer
  period  of  time  may  apply,  if a taxpayer files an amended return, an
  assessment of tax (if not deemed to have been made upon  the  filing  of
  the  amended  return),  including  recovery of a previously paid refund,
  attributable to a change or correction on  the  amended  return  from  a


 prior  return may be made at any time within one year after such amended
  return is filed.
    (d)  Omission  of  income,  total  taxable  amount  or ordinary income

  at any time within six years after the return was filed if--
    (1)  an  individual  omits from his New York adjusted gross income, or
  the total taxable amount or  ordinary  income  portion  of  a  lump  sum
  distribution an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of
  twenty-five  percent of the amount of New York adjusted gross income, or
  the total taxable amount or  ordinary  income  portion  of  a  lump  sum
  distribution stated in the return, or

  return,  or  in a statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate
  to apprise the commissioner of the nature and  amount  of  the  item  of
  income,  total  taxable  amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum
  distribution.
    (e) Suspension of running of period of limitation.--The running of the
  period of limitations on assessment or collection of tax or other amount
  (or of a transferee's liability) shall, after the mailing of a notice of

   §  684.  Interest  on  underpayment.--  (a) General.--If any amount of
  income tax is not paid on or before the last  date  prescribed  in  this
  article  for  payment,  interest on such amount at the underpayment rate
  set by the commissioner pursuant to section six hundred ninety-seven  of
  this  part,  or  if  no  rate  is set, at the rate of seven and one-half
  percent per annum shall be paid for the period from such  last  date  to
  the  date  paid,  whether  or  not any extension of time for payment was
  granted. Interest under this subsection shall not be paid if the  amount
  thereof  is  less than one dollar. If the time for filing of a return of
  tax withheld by an employer is extended, the employer shall pay interest
  for the period for which the extension is granted  and  may  not  charge
  such interest to the employee.
    (b)  Exception  as  to estimated tax.--This section shall not apply to
  any failure to pay estimated tax.
    (c) Exception for mathematical or clerical error.--No  interest  shall
  be  imposed  on  any  underpayment  of tax due solely to mathematical or
  clerical error if the taxpayer files a return within the time prescribed
  in this article (including any extension of time) and pays the amount of
  underpayment within three months after the due date of such  return,  as
  it may be extended.
    (d)   Suspension   of   interest  on  deficiencies.--If  a  waiver  of
  restrictions on assessment  of  a  deficiency  has  been  filed  by  the
  taxpayer,  and if notice and demand by the tax commission for payment of
  such deficiency is not made within thirty days after the filing of  such
  waiver,  interest shall not be imposed on such deficiency for the period
  beginning immediately after such thirtieth day and ending with the  date
  of notice and demand.
    (e)  Tax  reduced  by carryback.--If the amount of tax for any taxable
  year is reduced by reason of a carryback of a net operating  loss,  such
  reduction in tax shall not affect the computation of interest under this
  section  for the period ending with the filing date for the taxable year
  in which the net operating  loss  arises.  Such  filing  date  shall  be
  determined without regard to extensions of time to file.
    (f)  Interest  treated  as  tax.--Interest under this section shall be
  paid upon notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in
  the same manner as income tax. Any reference in this article to the  tax
  imposed  by  this  article  shall  be  deemed  also to refer to interest
  imposed by this section on such tax.
    (g) Interest on penalties or  additions  to  tax.--Interest  shall  be
  imposed  under  subsection  (a)  of  this  section  in  respect  of  any
  assessable penalty or addition to tax only if such assessable penalty or
  addition to tax is not paid within twenty-one  calendar  days  from  the
  date  of  the notice and demand therefor under subsection (b) of section
  six hundred ninety-two of this article (ten business days if the  amount
  for  which  such notice and demand is made equals or exceeds one hundred
  thousand dollars), and in such case interest shall be imposed  only  for
  the  period  from  such  date  of  the  notice and demand to the date of
  payment.
    (h) Payment within  specified  period  after  notice  and  demand.--If
  notice and demand is made for payment of any amount under subsection (b)
  of section six hundred ninety-two of this article, and if such amount is
  paid  within  twenty-one  calendar days (ten business days if the amount
  for which such notice and demand is made equals or exceeds  one  hundred
  thousand  dollars)  after  the  date of such notice and demand, interest
  under this section on the amount so paid shall not be  imposed  for  the
  period after the date of such notice and demand.
    (i)  Limitation  on  assessment  and  collection.--Interest prescribed
  under this section may be assessed and collected at any time during  the


 period  within  which  the  tax  or  other amount to which such interest
  relates may be assessed and collected, respectively.
    (j)  Interest on erroneous refund.--Any portion of tax or other amount
  which has been erroneously refunded, and which  is  recoverable  by  the
  commissioner,  shall  bear  interest at the underpayment rate set by the
  commissioner pursuant to section six hundred ninety-seven of this  part,
  or  if  no  rate  is  set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per
  annum from the date of the payment of the refund, but only if it appears
  that any part of the refund was induced by fraud or a  misrepresentation
  of a material fact.
    (k)  Satisfaction by credits.--If any portion of a tax is satisfied by
  credit of an overpayment, then no interest shall be imposed  under  this
  section  on  the  portion  of the tax so satisfied for any period during
  which, if the credit  had  not  been  made,  interest  would  have  been
  allowable with respect to such overpayment.




   §  685. Additions to tax and civil penalties.--(a) (1) Failure to file
  tax return.--
    (A) In case of failure to file a tax return under this article  on  or
  before  the  prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of
  time for filing), unless it  is  shown  that  such  failure  is  due  to
  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to
  the  amount  required  to be shown as tax on such return five percent of
  the amount of such tax if the failure is for not more  than  one  month,
  with  an  additional  five percent for each additional month or fraction
  thereof during which such failure continues, not  exceeding  twenty-five
  percent in the aggregate.
    (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days
  of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard
  to  any  extension  of  time  for  filing), unless it is shown that such
  failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful  neglect,  the
  addition  to  tax  under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be
  less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or one  hundred  percent  of
  the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.
    (C)  For  purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required to be
  shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any  part  of  the
  tax  which  is  paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the
  tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
  upon the return.
    (2) Failure to pay tax shown on return.--In case of failure to pay the
  amounts shown as tax on any return  required  to  be  filed  under  this
  article  on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any
  extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure  is
  due  to  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be
  added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one per cent
  of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month,
  with an additional one-half of one per cent for each additional month or
  fraction thereof during which  such  failure  continues,  not  exceeding
  twenty-five  per cent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the
  addition for any month, the amount of tax shown on the return  shall  be
  reduced  by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before
  the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against  the
  tax  which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required
  to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown  as  tax  on  such
  return,  this  paragraph  shall  be  applied  by substituting such lower
  amount.
    (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown  on  return.--In  case  of
  failure  to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on
  a return required to be filed under this article which is not  so  shown
  (including  an assessment made pursuant to subsection (a) of section six
  hundred eighty-two of this article) within twenty-one calendar  days  of
  the  date  of  a  notice  and  demand therefor (ten business days if the
  amount for which such notice and demand is made equals  or  exceeds  one
  hundred  thousand  dollars), unless it is shown that such failure is due
  to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added
  to the amount of tax stated in such notice and demand  one-half  of  one
  percent  of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with
  an additional one-half of one  percent  for  each  additional  month  or
  fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure continues, not exceeding
  twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of  computing  the
  addition  for  any  month,  the  amount  of tax stated in the notice and
  demand shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the  tax  which  is
  paid before the beginning of such month.
    (4) Limitations on additions.--


   (A)  With  respect  to  any  return,  the amount of the addition under
  paragraph one of this subsection shall be reduced by the amount  of  the
  addition  under  paragraph two of this subsection for any month to which
  an addition applies under both paragraphs  one  and  two.  In  any  case
  described  in  subparagraph (B) of such paragraph one, the amount of the
  addition under such paragraph one shall not be reduced below the  amount
  provided in such subparagraph.
    (B)  With  respect  to  any return, the maximum amount of the addition
  permitted under paragraph three of this subsection shall be  reduced  by
  the  amount  of  the  addition  under  paragraph  one of this subsection
  (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph)  which
  is  attributable  to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and
  which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.
    (b) Deficiency due to negligence.--
    (1) If any part of a deficiency is due to  negligence  or  intentional
  disregard of this article or rules or regulations hereunder (but without
  intent  to  defraud), there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to
  five percent of the deficiency.
    (2) There shall be added  to  the  tax  (in  addition  to  the  amount
  determined  under  paragraph  one of this subsection) an amount equal to
  fifty  percent  of  the  interest  payable  under  section  six  hundred
  eighty-four with respect to the portion of the underpayment described in
  such   paragraph   one  which  is  attributable  to  the  negligence  or
  intentional disregard referred to in such paragraph one, for the  period
  beginning  on  the  last  date  prescribed  by  law  for payment of such
  underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending  on
  the  date  of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the
  payment of the tax).
    (3) If any payment is shown on a return made by a payor  with  respect
  to  dividends,  patronage dividends and interest under subsection (a) of
  section six thousand forty-two, subsection (a) of section  six  thousand
  forty-four  or  subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-nine of the
  internal revenue code, respectively, and the payee fails to include  any
  portion  of  such payment in New York adjusted gross income, any portion
  of an underpayment attributable to such failure shall  be  treated,  for
  purposes  of  this  subsection,  as  due to negligence in the absence of
  clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. If any penalty is imposed
  under this subsection by reason of the preceding sentence, the amount of
  the penalty imposed by paragraph one of this subsection  shall  be  five
  percent  of the portion of the underpayment which is attributable to the
  failure described in the preceding sentence.
    (c) Failure by individual to pay estimated income tax.--
    (1) Addition  to  the  tax.--Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this
  subsection  and  subsection  (d)  of  this  section,  in the case of any
  underpayment of estimated tax by an individual, there shall be added  to
  the  tax under this article for the taxable year an amount determined by
  applying the underpayment  rate  established  under  subsection  (j)  of
  section  six hundred ninety-seven of this part, or if no rate is set, at
  the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, to the amount  of  the
  underpayment  for  the period of the underpayment. Such period shall run
  from the due date for the required installment to  the  earlier  of  the
  fifteenth  day  of  the  fourth month following the close of the taxable
  year or, with respect to any portion of the underpayment,  the  date  on
  which  such  portion  is  paid. For purposes of determining such date, a
  payment of estimated tax  shall  be  credited  against  unpaid  required
  installments  in the order in which such installments are required to be
  paid. There shall be four required installments for each  taxable  year,


 due  on  April fifteenth, June fifteenth and September fifteenth of such
  taxable year and on January fifteenth of the following taxable year.
    (2) Amount of underpayment.--For purposes of paragraph one, the amount
  of the underpayment shall be the excess of the required installment over
  the  amount,  if  any, of the installment paid on or before the due date
  for the installment.
    (3) Required installment. (A) Except as provided in paragraph four  of
  this  subsection,  the  amount  of  any  required  installment  shall be
  twenty-five percent of the required annual payment.
    (B) The required annual payment is the lesser of
    (i) ninety percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year
  (or, if no return is filed, ninety percent of the tax for such year), or
    (ii) one hundred percent of  the  tax  shown  on  the  return  of  the
  individual  for  the  preceding taxable year. Provided, however, the tax
  shown on such return for taxable years beginning  in  two  thousand  two
  shall  be  the  tax  calculated  as  if such years began in two thousand
  three. Provided further, however, that the tax shown on such return  for
  taxable  years beginning in two thousand eight shall be calculated as if
  paragraph three of subsection (f) of section six hundred fifteen of this
  article has been in effect for taxable years beginning in  two  thousand
  eight.  Further  provided  that the tax shown on such return for taxable
  years beginning in two thousand eight shall be the tax calculated as  if
  such  years  began in two thousand nine. Provided, however, that the tax
  shown on such return for taxable years beginning in  two  thousand  nine
  shall be calculated as if paragraph two of subsection (g) of section six
  hundred  fifteen  of  this  article  was  in  effect  for  taxable years
  beginning in two thousand nine and ending before two thousand thirteen.
    Clause (ii) of this subparagraph shall  not  apply  if  the  preceding
  taxable  year  was  not  a  taxable  year  of  twelve  months  or if the
  individual did not file a return for such preceding taxable year.
    (C) Limitation on use of preceding year's tax.
    (i) General. If the New York adjusted gross income shown on the return
  of the individual for the preceding taxable  year  exceeds  one  hundred
  fifty  thousand  dollars,  clause  (ii)  of  subparagraph  (B)  of  this
  paragraph shall be applied by substituting "one hundred ten percent" for
  "one hundred percent".
    (ii) Separate returns. In the case of a  husband  and  wife  who  file
  separate  returns  pursuant  to  subsection  (b)  of section six hundred
  fifty-one for the taxable year for which the amount of  the  installment
  is being determined, clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be applied by
  substituting  "seventy-five  thousand  dollars"  for  "one hundred fifty
  thousand dollars".
    (4) Annualized income installment.--(A) In general.--In  the  case  of
  any  required  installment,  if  the  individual  establishes  that  the
  annualized income installment determined under subparagraph (B) of  this
  paragraph  is less than the amount determined under paragraph three, the
  annualized income installment shall be  the  required  installment.  Any
  reduction  in  a  required installment resulting from the application of
  this subparagraph shall be recaptured by increasing the  amount  of  the
  next required installment determined under paragraph three by the amount
  of such reduction, and by increasing successive required installments as
  necessary to effect full recapture.
    (B)  Determination  of  annualized income installment.--In the case of
  any required installment,  the  annualized  income  installment  is  the
  excess,  if  any, of an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the
  tax for the taxable year computed by placing on an annualized basis  the
  taxable income for months in the taxable year ending before the due date
  for  the  installment,  over  the aggregate amount of any prior required


 installments for the taxable year. The applicable percentage of the  tax
  shall  be  twenty-two  and  one-half  percent  in  the case of the first
  installment, forty-five percent in the case of the  second  installment,
  sixty-seven  and  one-half  percent in the case of the third installment
  and ninety percent in the case of the fourth installment, and  shall  be
  computed  without  regard to any increase in the rates applicable to the
  taxable year unless such increase was enacted at least thirty days prior
  to the due date of the installment.
    (5) Definitions and special rules.--(A) Definition of the term tax and
  application of credits against tax.--For purposes of this subsection and
  subsection (d), the term "tax" means the tax imposed under this  article
  minus the credits against tax allowed under this article, other than the
  credit under section six hundred seventy-three, relating to tax withheld
  on wages. The credit allowed under section six hundred seventy-three for
  the  taxable  year  shall  be  deemed a payment of estimated tax, and an
  equal part of such amount shall be deemed paid on each  installment  due
  date for such taxable year, unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on
  which  all  amounts were actually withheld, in which case the amounts so
  withheld shall be deemed payments of estimated tax on the dates on which
  such amounts were actually withheld.
    (B)  Special  rule  where  return   filed   on   or   before   January
  thirty-first.--If,  on  or  before January thirty-first of the following
  taxable year, the taxpayer files a return for the taxable year and  pays
  in  full  the amount computed on the return as payable, then no addition
  to tax shall  be  imposed  under  paragraph  one  with  respect  to  any
  underpayment of the fourth required installment for the taxable year.
    (C)  Special  rules  for  farmers and fishermen.--For purposes of this
  subsection, if an individual is a farmer or fisherman  for  any  taxable
  year  there shall be only one required installment for the taxable year,
  due on January fifteenth of the following  taxable  year  in  an  amount
  equal to the required annual payment determined under paragraph three by
  substituting  sixty-six  and  two-thirds  percent for ninety percent and
  without  regard  to  subparagraph  (C)  of  paragraph  three   of   this
  subsection.  Subparagraph  (B)  of  this  paragraph  shall be applied by
  substituting March first for January thirty-first and  by  treating  the
  required  installment  under  this  subparagraph  as the fourth required
  installment. An individual is a farmer or fisherman for any taxable year
  if the  individual's  federal  gross  income  from  farming  or  fishing
  (including  oyster  farming) for the taxable year is at least two-thirds
  of the total federal gross income from all sources for the taxable  year
  or  if  such  individual's  federal gross income from farming or fishing
  (including oyster farming) shown on the return of the individual for the
  preceding taxable year is at least two-thirds of the total federal gross
  income from all sources shown on such return.
    (D) Fiscal years.--In applying  this  subsection  to  a  taxable  year
  beginning  on  any  date  other  than  January  first,  there  shall  be
  substituted, for the months specified in  this  subsection,  the  months
  which correspond thereto.
    (E)  Short  taxable year.--This subsection shall be applied to taxable
  years  of  less  than  twelve  months  in  accordance  with  regulations
  prescribed by the tax commission.
    (F)  Joint  estimated tax of husband and wife.--A husband and wife may
  make the required annual payment determined under paragraph three as  if
  they  were one taxpayer, in which case the liability under paragraph one
  with respect to the estimated tax shall be joint and  several.  No  such
  joint  payment  may  be  made  if husband and wife are separated under a
  decree of divorce or separate maintenance, or  if  they  have  different
  taxable years. If a joint payment is made but husband and wife determine


 their  taxes  under  this article separately, the estimated tax for such
  year may be treated as the estimated tax of either husband or  wife,  or
  may be divided between them, as they may elect.
    (6)  Trusts  and  certain  estates. (A) General. This subsection shall
  apply to any trust or estate except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and
  (C) of this paragraph.
    (B) Exception for estates and certain trusts.  This  subsection  shall
  not  apply  with  respect to any taxable year ending before the date two
  years after the date of the decedent's death to (i) the estate  of  such
  decedent  or (ii) any trust all of which was treated (under subpart E of
  part I of subchapter J of chapter one of the internal revenue  code)  as
  owned  by the decedent and to which the residue of the decedent's estate
  will pass under his will (or, if no will is admitted to  probate,  which
  is  the trust primarily responsible for paying debts, taxes and expenses
  of administration).
    (C) Special rule for annualizations. In the  case  of  any  estate  or
  trust,  subparagraph  (B)  of paragraph four of this subsection shall be
  applied by substituting "ending before the date one month before the due
  date for the installment" for  "ending  before  the  due  date  for  the
  installment".
    (D) In the case of a trust, the trustee may elect to treat any portion
  of a payment of estimated tax made by such trust for any taxable year of
  the  trust  as a payment made by a beneficiary of such trust. Any amount
  so treated shall be treated as paid or credited to  the  beneficiary  on
  the  last day of such taxable year, and for purposes of this subsection,
  the amount so treated shall not be treated as a payment of estimated tax
  made by the trust, but shall be treated as a payment  of  estimated  tax
  made  by  such beneficiary on the January fifteenth following the end of
  the trust's taxable year.
    (E) An election under subparagraph (D) of this paragraph shall be made
  on or before the sixty-fifth day after the close of the taxable year and
  in  such  manner  as  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  may
  prescribe.
    (F)  Extension  to last year of estate.--In the case of a taxable year
  reasonably expected to be the  last  taxable  year  of  an  estate,  any
  reference  in  subparagraph  (D)  of  this paragraph to a trust shall be
  treated as including a reference to an estate, and the fiduciary of  the
  estate shall be treated as the trustee.
    (d)  Exceptions to addition to tax for failure to pay estimated income
  tax.--
    (1) Where tax is small amount.--No addition to tax  shall  be  imposed
  under subsection (c) for any taxable year if the tax shown on the return
  for  such  taxable year (or, if no return is filed, the tax), reduced by
  the credit allowable under section six hundred  seventy-three,  is  less
  than three hundred dollars.
    (2) Where no tax liability for preceding taxable year.--No addition to
  tax  shall  be  imposed under subsection (c) for any taxable year if the
  preceding taxable  year  was  a  taxable  year  of  twelve  months,  the
  individual did not have any liability for tax under this article for the
  preceding  taxable  year  and  throughout the preceding taxable year the
  individual was a resident of this state or a  nonresident  or  part-year
  resident who had New York source income.
    (3)  Installment  due  on or after individual's death.--No addition to
  tax  shall  be  imposed  under  subsection  (c)  with  respect  to   any
  installment due on or after the individual's death.
    (4)  Waiver  in  certain  cases.--(A)  In general.--No addition to tax
  shall be imposed under subsection (c) with respect to  any  underpayment
  to  the extent the tax commission determines that by reason of casualty,


 disaster or other unusual circumstances the imposition of such  addition
  to tax would be against equity and good conscience.
    (B)  Newly  retired or disabled individuals.--No addition to tax shall
  be imposed under subsection (c) with respect to any underpayment if  the
  tax  commission  determines that in the taxable year for which estimated
  payments were required to be made or in the taxable year preceding  such
  taxable year the taxpayer retired after having attained age sixty-two or
  became  disabled, and that such underpayment was due to reasonable cause
  and not to willful neglect.
    (e) Deficiency due to fraud.--(1) If any part of a deficiency  is  due
  to  fraud,  there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to two times
  the deficiency.
    (2) The addition to tax under this subsection shall be in lieu of  any
  other addition to tax imposed by subsection (a) or (b).
    (3) In the case of a joint return under section six hundred fifty-one,
  this  subsection  shall  not  apply  with respect to the tax of a spouse
  unless some part of the underpayment is due to the fraud of such spouse.
    (f) Non-willful failure to pay withholding  tax.--  If  any  employer,
  without intent to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this article or the
  payment  thereof,  shall fail to make a return and pay a tax withheld by
  him at the time required by or  under  the  provisions  of  section  six
  hundred  seventy-four,  such  employer  shall be liable for such tax and
  shall pay the same together with interest thereon and  the  addition  to
  tax  provided  in  subsection (a), and such interest and addition to tax
  shall not be charged to or collected from the employee by the  employer.
  The  tax  commission  shall  have  the  same  rights  and powers for the
  collection of such tax,  interest  and  addition  to  tax  against  such
  employer as are now prescribed by this article for the collection of tax
  against an individual taxpayer.
    (g) Willful failure to collect and pay over tax.-- Any person required
  to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over the tax imposed by this
  article  who  willfully  fails to collect such tax or truthfully account
  for and pay over such tax or willfully attempts in any manner  to  evade
  or  defeat  the  tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other
  penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to  the  sum  of
  (i)  the  total  amount  of  the  tax  evaded,  or not collected, or not
  accounted for and paid over, and (ii) the interest that has  accrued  on
  the total amount of tax evaded on the date this penalty is first imposed
  until  this  penalty  is  paid with interest thereon. No addition to tax
  under subsections (b) or (e) of this section shall be  imposed  for  any
  offense  to which this subsection applies. The tax commission shall have
  the power, in its discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise any penalty
  under this subsection.
    (h) Failure to file  certain  information  returns.--  (1)  Except  as
  otherwise  provided in this paragraph, in case of each failure to file a
  statement of a payment to another person, required  under  authority  of
  subsection   (d)   of  section  six  hundred  fifty-eight  (relating  to
  information at source) on the date prescribed therefor (determined  with
  regard  to  any  extension  of time for filing), unless it is shown that
  such failure is due to reasonable cause  and  not  to  willful  neglect,
  there  shall, upon notice and demand by the commissioner and in the same
  manner as tax, be paid by the person so failing to file the statement, a
  penalty of fifty dollars for each statement not so filed, but the  total
  amount imposed on the delinquent person for all such failures during any
  calendar year shall not exceed ten thousand dollars.
    (2)  If  any  partnership,  S corporation, or trust required to file a
  return or report under subsection (c) or subsection (f) of  section  six
  hundred  fifty-eight  or  under  section  six hundred fifty-nine of this


 article for any taxable year fails to file such return or report at  the
  time  prescribed  therefor  (determined  with regard to any extension of
  time for filing), or files a return or report which fails  to  show  the
  information  required  under  such subsection (c) or section six hundred
  fifty-nine of this article, unless it is shown that such failure is  due
  to  reasonable  cause  and not due to willful neglect, there shall, upon
  notice and demand by the commissioner and in the same manner as tax,  be
  paid  by  the  partnership or S corporation a penalty for each month (or
  fraction thereof) during which such failure continues (but not to exceed
  five months). The amount of such penalty for any month is the product of
  fifty dollars, multiplied by the number of partners in  the  partnership
  or shareholders in the S corporation during any part of the taxable year
  who  were  subject  to  tax  under  this article during any part of such
  taxable year, except that, in the case of a trust, the penalty shall  be
  equal  to  one  hundred fifty dollars a month up to a maximum of fifteen
  hundred dollars per taxable year.
    (i) Additional penalty.--Any person who with fraudulent  intent  shall
  fail  to  pay,  or  to  deduct or withhold and pay, any tax, or to make,
  render, sign or certify any return, or to supply any information  within
  the  time  required by or under this article, shall be liable to penalty
  of not more than one thousand dollars, in addition to any other  amounts
  required  under  this  article, to be imposed, assessed and collected by
  the tax commission. The tax commission shall  have  the  power,  in  its
  discretion,  to  waive,  reduce  or  compromise  any  penalty under this
  subsection.
    (j) Fraudulent statement or failure to furnish statement to  employee.
  --  In  addition  to  any criminal penalties provided by law, any person
  required under the provisions of  section  six  hundred  seventy-two  to
  furnish  a  statement  to an employee, who wilfully furnishes a false or
  fraudulent statement, or who wilfully fails to furnish  a  statement  in
  the  manner,  at  the  time,  and showing the information required under
  section six hundred seventy-two, or regulations  prescribed  thereunder,
  shall  for  each such failure be subject to a penalty under this article
  of fifty dollars.
    (k) Failure to supply identifying numbers. -- If  any  person  who  is
  required  by  regulations prescribed under subsection (b) of section six
  hundred fifty-eight
    (1) to include his identifying number in  any  return,  statement,  or
  other document;
    (2) to furnish his identifying number to another person; or
    (3)  to  include  in any return, statement or other document made with
  respect to another person the identifying number of such  other  person,
  fails  to  comply  with  such requirement at the time prescribed by such
  regulations, such person shall, unless it is shown that such failure  is
  due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, pay a penalty of
  five  dollars  for  each such failure described in paragraph one of this
  subsection  and  fifty  dollars  for  each  such  failure  described  in
  paragraphs  two  and  three  of  this  subsection, except that the total
  amount imposed on such person for all such failures during any  calendar
  year  shall  not exceed ten thousand dollars; except that for failure to
  include his own identification number in any return, statement or  other
  document,  such  penalty  shall  not be imposed unless such person shall
  have failed to supply his identification number to  the  tax  commission
  within thirty days after demand therefor.
    (l)  Additions  treated  as tax. -- The additions to tax and penalties
  provided by this section shall be paid upon notice and demand and  shall
  be  assessed,  collected  and  paid in the same manner as taxes, and any
  reference in this article to income tax or tax imposed by this  article,


 shall  be  deemed  also  to  refer to the additions to tax and penalties
  provided  by  this  section.  For  purposes  of  section   six   hundred
  eighty-one, this subsection shall not apply to --
    (1) any addition to tax under subsection (a) except as to that portion
  attributable to a deficiency;
    (2) any addition to tax under subsection (c);
    (3)  any penalty under subsection (h) and any additional penalty under
  subsection (i); and
    (4) any penalties under subsections (j), (k), (q), (r), (s), (u),  (v)
  and (w).
    (m)  Determination  of  deficiency. -- For purposes of subsections (b)
  and (e), the amount shown as the tax by the  taxpayer  upon  his  return
  shall  be taken into account in determining the amount of the deficiency
  only if such return was filed on or before the last day  prescribed  for
  the  filing  of  such return, determined with regard to any extension of
  time for such filing.
    (n) Person defined. For purposes of subsections (g), (i), (o), (q) and
  (r), the term person includes an individual, corporation, partnership or
  limited liability company or an officer or employee of  any  corporation
  (including  a  dissolved  corporation),  or  a member or employee of any
  partnership, or a member, manager or employee  of  a  limited  liability
  company,  who  as  such  officer, employee, manager or member is under a
  duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.
    (o) Failure to make deposits of taxes. -- In case of  failure  by  any
  person required by this article, or by regulations of the tax commission
  under  this  article,  to  deposit  on  the date prescribed therefor any
  amount of tax  imposed  by  this  article  in  a  depository  authorized
  pursuant  to  subsection  (a)  of section six hundred ninety-two of this
  article to receive such deposits, unless it is shown that  such  failure
  is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall
  be imposed on such person a penalty of five per cent of  the  amount  of
  the   underpayment.   For   purposes   of   this   subsection  the  term
  "underpayment" means the excess of the amount of the tax required to  be
  so  deposited  over  the amount, if any, thereof, deposited on or before
  the date prescribed therefor.
    * (p) Substantial understatement of liability.-- (1)  If  there  is  a
  substantial  understatement  of  income  tax for any taxable year, there
  shall be added to the tax an amount equal to ten percent of  the  amount
  of any underpayment attributable to such understatement. For purposes of
  this subsection, there is a substantial understatement of income tax for
  any  taxable  year  if  the amount of the understatement for the taxable
  year exceeds the greater of ten percent of the tax required to be  shown
  on  the  return  for  the  taxable  year,  or  two thousand dollars. For
  purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "understatement" means  the
  excess  of  the amount of the tax required to be shown on the return for
  the taxable year, over the amount of tax imposed which is shown  on  the
  return  reduced  by  any rebate (within the meaning of subsection (g) of
  section six hundred eighty-one). The excess under the preceding sentence
  shall be determined without regard to items to which subsection (p-1) of
  this section applies. The commissioner may waive all or any part of  the
  addition to tax provided by this subsection on a showing by the taxpayer
  that there was reasonable cause for the understatement, or part thereof,
  and that the taxpayer acted in good faith.
    (2)  The  amount  of  the  understatement under paragraph (1) shall be
  reduced by that portion of the understatement which is  attributable  to
  (A)  the  tax  treatment  of any item by the taxpayer if there is or was
  substantial authority for  such  treatment,  or  (B)  any  item  if  the


 relevant  facts  affecting  the  item's  tax  treatment  are  adequately
  disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return.
    (3)(A)  Subparagraph (B) of paragraph two of this subsection shall not
  apply to any item attributable to a tax shelter.
    (B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "tax shelter" means
    (i) a partnership or other entity,
    (ii) any investment plan or arrangement, or
    (iii) any other plan or arrangement,
  if  a  significant  purpose  of  such  partnership,  entity,  plan,   or
  arrangement is the avoidance or evasion of tax.
    * NB Effective until July 1, 2024
    * (p)   Substantial   understatement  of  liability.--If  there  is  a
  substantial understatement of income tax for  any  taxable  year,  there
  shall  be  added to the tax an amount equal to ten percent of the amount
  of any underpayment attributable to such understatement. For purposes of
  this subsection, there is a substantial understatement of income tax for
  any taxable year if the amount of the  understatement  for  the  taxable
  year  exceeds the greater of ten percent of the tax required to be shown
  on the return for  the  taxable  year,  or  two  thousand  dollars.  For
  purposes  of the preceding sentence, the term "understatement" means the
  excess of the amount of the tax required to be shown on the  return  for
  the  taxable  year, over the amount of tax imposed which is shown on the
  return reduced by any rebate (within the meaning of  subsection  (g)  of
  section six hundred eighty-one). The amount of such understatement shall
  be  reduced  by that portion of the understatement which is attributable
  to the tax treatment of any item by the taxpayer  if  there  is  or  was
  substantial  authority  for  such treatment, or any item with respect to
  which  the  relevant  facts  affecting  the  item's  tax  treatment  are
  adequately  disclosed  in  the  return or in a statement attached to the
  return. The tax commission may waive all or any part of the addition  to
  tax  provided by this subsection on a showing by the taxpayer that there
  was reasonable cause for the understatement, or part thereof,  and  that
  the taxpayer acted in good faith.
    * NB Effective July 1, 2024
    * (p-1) Reportable transaction understatement.-- (1) If a taxpayer has
  a  reportable  transaction  understatement  for  any taxable year, there
  shall be added to the tax an amount  equal  to  twenty  percent  of  the
  amount of such understatement.
    (2)  For  purposes  of  this section, the term "reportable transaction
  understatement" means the sum of:
    (A) the product of--
    (i) the amount of the increase (if any) in  the  applicable  tax  base
  which  results  from a difference between the proper tax treatment of an
  item to which this section applies and the taxpayer's treatment of  such
  item (as shown on the taxpayer's return of tax), and
    (ii) the highest rate of tax imposed by this article, and
    (B)  the  amount  of  the decrease (if any) in the aggregate amount of
  credits determined under this article which results  from  a  difference
  between  the  taxpayer's  treatment  of  an  item  to which this section
  applies (as shown on the taxpayer's return of tax) and  the  proper  tax
  treatment of such item.
    For  purposes  of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, any reduction of
  the excess of deductions allowed for the taxable year over gross  income
  for  such  year, and any reduction in the amount of capital losses which
  would (without regard to section one thousand two hundred eleven of  the
  internal  revenue code) be allowed for such year, shall be treated as an
  increase in the applicable tax base.
    (3) This subsection shall apply to any item which is attributable to--


   (A) any listed transaction, and
    (B)  any reportable transaction (other than a listed transaction) if a
  significant purpose of such transaction is the avoidance or  evasion  of
  tax.
    (4)  Paragraph one of this subsection shall be applied by substituting
  "thirty percent" for "twenty percent" with respect to the portion of any
  reportable  transaction  understatement  with  respect  to   which   the
  requirement  of  clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph ten of this
  subsection is not met.
    (5)  For  purposes  of  this   subsection,   the   terms   "reportable
  transaction"  and  "listed  transaction" have the meanings given to such
  terms by section twenty-five  of  this  chapter,  the  term  "reportable
  transaction"  shall  include  a  "New  York  reportable  transaction" as
  defined in such section twenty-five, and the term  "listed  transaction"
  shall  include any transaction designated as a tax avoidance transaction
  pursuant to such section twenty-five.
    (6) In the case of an understatement (as defined in subsection (p)  of
  this section):
    (A)  the  amount  of such understatement (determined without regard to
  this paragraph) shall be increased by the aggregate amount of reportable
  transaction understatements for purposes  of  determining  whether  such
  understatement  is  a substantial understatement under subsection (p) of
  this section, and (B) the addition to tax under subsection (p)  of  this
  section  shall apply only to the excess of the amount of the substantial
  understatement (if any) after the application of this subparagraph  over
  the aggregate amount of reportable transaction understatements.
    (7)  References  to  an understatement (or a deficiency) in subsection
  (e) of this section shall  be  treated  as  including  references  to  a
  reportable transaction understatement.
    (8)   This   subsection   shall  not  apply  to  any  portion  of  any
  understatement on which a penalty is imposed  under  subsection  (e)  of
  this section.
    (9)  Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the commissioner,
  in no event shall any  tax  treatment  included  with  an  amendment  or
  supplement  to  a return of tax be taken into account in determining the
  amount of any reportable transaction understatement if the amendment  or
  supplement  is filed after the earlier of the date the taxpayer is first
  contacted by the commissioner regarding the examination of the return or
  such other date as is specified by the commissioner.
    (10)(A) No penalty shall be imposed under this subsection with respect
  to any portion of a reportable transaction understatement if it is shown
  that there was a reasonable cause for such portion and that the taxpayer
  acted in good faith with respect to such portion.
    (B) Subparagraph  (A)  of  this  paragraph  shall  not  apply  to  any
  reportable transaction understatement unless
    (i)  the  relevant  facts  affecting the tax treatment of the item are
  adequately disclosed in accordance  with  section  twenty-five  of  this
  chapter,
    (ii) there is or was substantial authority for such treatment, and
    (iii)  the  taxpayer  reasonably believed that such treatment was more
  likely than not the proper treatment.
  A taxpayer failing to adequately disclose  in  accordance  with  section
  twenty-five of this chapter shall be treated as meeting the requirements
  of  clause  (i) of this subparagraph if the penalty for such failure was
  rescinded under subsection (x) of this section.
    (11)(A) A taxpayer shall be treated as having a reasonable belief with
  respect to the tax treatment of an item only if such belief


   (i) is based on the facts and law that exist at the  time  the  return
  which includes such tax treatment is filed, and
    (ii) relates solely to the taxpayer's chances of success on the merits
  of  such treatment and does not take into account the possibility that a
  return will not be audited, such treatment will not be raised on  audit,
  or such treatment will be resolved through settlement if it is raised.
    (B)(i) An opinion of a tax advisor may not be relied upon to establish
  the reasonable belief of a taxpayer if
    (I)  the tax advisor is described in clause (ii) of this subparagraph,
  or
    (II) the opinion is described in clause (iii) of this subparagraph.
    (ii) A tax advisor is described in this clause if the tax advisor
    (I) is a material advisor (within the meaning of section six  thousand
  one  hundred  eleven of the internal revenue code or within such meaning
  as it also applies to a New York reportable transaction  as  defined  in
  section   twenty-five   of   this   chapter)  and  participates  in  the
  organization, management, promotion, or sale of the  transaction  or  is
  related  (within  the  meaning  of subsection (b) of section two hundred
  sixty-seven of the internal revenue code or subsection  (b)  of  section
  seven  hundred  seven of the internal revenue code) to any person who so
  participates,
    (II) is compensated directly or indirectly by a material advisor  with
  respect to the transaction,
    (III)  has  a fee arrangement with respect to the transaction which is
  contingent on all  or  part  of  the  intended  tax  benefits  from  the
  transaction being sustained, or
    (IV)  has  a  disqualifying  financial  interest  with  respect to the
  transaction.
    (iii) For purposes of clause (i) of this subparagraph, an  opinion  is
  disqualified if the opinion
    (I)  is  based on unreasonable factual or legal assumptions (including
  assumptions as to future events),
    (II) unreasonably relies on representations, statements, findings,  or
  agreements of the taxpayer or any other person,
    (III) does not identify and consider all relevant facts, or
    (IV)  fails  to  meet  any  other  requirement as the commissioner may
  prescribe.

  this section for a taxable year beginning on or after January first, two
  thousand  eight  and  before  January first, two thousand nine resulting

  because  an empire zone retention certificate was not issued pursuant to

  municipal  law  to the empire zone enterprise which is the basis for the
  tax credit or credits claimed on the return.

  substantial  correctness  of  the  self-assessment  may  be  judged,  or
  contains information that on its face indicates that the self-assessment
  is substantially incorrect; and such conduct is due to a position  which
  is  frivolous,  including  a  position  identified  as  frivolous  under
  paragraph three of this subsection, or an intent to delay or impede  the
  administration of this article, then such individual shall pay a penalty
  not  exceeding  five thousand dollars. This penalty shall be in addition
  to any other penalty provided by law.

  the submission within thirty days after such notice, the penalty imposed
  under this paragraph will not apply with respect to that submission.
    (3) Listing of frivolous positions. The  commissioner  will  prescribe
  (and  periodically revise) a list of positions that the commissioner has
  identified as frivolous for purposes of this subsection.
    (4) Reduction of penalty. The commissioner may reduce  the  amount  of

  statements or other documents.--(1) Any person who, with the intent that
  tax be evaded, shall, for a fee or other compensation or as an  incident

  (whether  or not a director, officer, employee, or agent of the taxpayer
  involved) over whose activities the person has  direction,  supervision,
  or control.
    (3)  For  purposes  of  paragraph  one  of  this  subsection, a person
  furnishing typing, reproducing,  or  other  mechanical  assistance  with
  respect  to  a document shall not be treated as having aided or assisted
  in the preparation of such document by reason of such assistance.
    (4) The penalty imposed by this subsection shall be in addition to any
  other penalty provided by law.
    (s) False information with respect to withholding.--In addition to any
  criminal penalty provided by law, if any individual  makes  a  statement
  under section six hundred seventy-one which results in a decrease in the
  amounts deducted and withheld under part five of this article, and as of
  the time such statement was made, there was no reasonable basis for such
  statement,  such  individual shall pay a penalty of five hundred dollars
  for such statement. The tax commission shall waive the  penalty  imposed
  under  this  subsection  if  the  taxes  imposed  with  respect  to  the
  individual under this article for the taxable year are equal to or  less


 than  the sum of the credits against such taxes allowed by this article,
  and the payments of estimated  tax  which  are  considered  payments  on
  account of such taxes.
    (t)  Unwarranted  reduction  in  utility  costs  in an empire zone. If
  during a taxable year a taxpayer has received a reduction  in  the  rate
  charged  for gas, electric, steam or water sold, or gas, electric, steam
  or water service rendered, pursuant to subdivision eight of section  one
  hundred  eighty-six-a  of this chapter, based upon a certification as to
  the claiming of a credit under subsection (k) of section six hundred six
  of this article, and it is finally determined that such taxpayer is  not
  entitled  to such credit in any part, such taxpayer shall be liable to a
  penalty in an amount equal to such reduction in cost, with interest from
  the last day of such year, at the rate applicable  to  underpayments  of
  tax  pursuant  to this article. The tax commission shall have the power,
  in its discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise such penalty.
    (u)  Failure  of  tax  return   preparer   to   conform   to   certain
  requirements.--(1)  Failure to sign return or claim for refund. If a tax
  return preparer who is required pursuant to paragraph one of  subsection
  (g)  of section six hundred fifty-eight of this article to sign a return
  or claim for refund fails to comply with such requirement  with  respect
  to  such  return  or  claim for refund, the tax return preparer shall be
  subject to a penalty of two hundred fifty dollars for each such  failure
  to sign, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause
  and  not  due to willful neglect. The maximum penalty imposed under this
  paragraph on any tax return  preparer  with  respect  to  returns  filed
  during  any calendar year by the tax return preparer must not exceed ten
  thousand dollars. Provided, however, that if a tax return  preparer  has
  been  penalized  under  this paragraph for a preceding calendar year and
  again fails to sign his or her name on any return that requires the  tax
  return  preparer's signature during a subsequent calendar year, then the
  penalty under this paragraph for  each  failure  will  be  five  hundred
  dollars, and no annual cap will apply. This paragraph shall not apply if
  the   penalty  under  paragraph  three  of  subsection  (g)  of  section
  thirty-two of this chapter is imposed on the tax  return  preparer  with
  respect to such return or claim for refund.
    (2)  Failure  to  furnish identifying number. If a tax return preparer
  fails to include any identifying number required to be included  on  any
  return  or  claim for refund pursuant to paragraph two of subsection (g)
  of section six hundred fifty-eight  of  this  article,  the  tax  return
  preparer  shall  be subject to a penalty of one hundred dollars for each
  such failure, unless it is shown that such failure is due to  reasonable
  cause  and  not  willful neglect. The maximum penalty imposed under this
  paragraph on any tax return  preparer  with  respect  to  returns  filed
  during  any  calendar  year  must  not  exceed two thousand five hundred
  dollars; provided, however, that if  a  tax  return  preparer  has  been
  penalized  under  this paragraph for a preceding calendar year and again
  fails to include the identifying number on one or more returns during  a
  subsequent calendar year, then the penalty under this paragraph for each
  failure will be two hundred fifty dollars, and no annual cap will apply.
  this  paragraph  shall  not apply if the penalty under paragraph four of
  subsection (g) of section thirty-two of this chapter is imposed  on  the
  tax return preparer with respect to such return or claim for refund.
    (3)  Failure  to  furnish  copy  to  taxpayer. Any person who is a tax
  return preparer with respect to any return or claim for refund,  who  is
  required  under paragraph three of subsection (g) of section six hundred
  fifty-eight of this article to furnish a copy of such  return  or  claim
  for  refund to the taxpayer, and who fails to comply with such provision
  with respect to such return or claim for refund, shall be subject  to  a


 penalty  of fifty dollars for each such failure, unless it is shown that
  such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful  neglect.
  The  maximum  penalty  imposed  under  this paragraph on any person with
  respect  to  returns or claims for refund filed during any calendar year
  shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars.
    (4) Failure to retain copy or list. Any person who  is  a  tax  return
  preparer with respect to any return or claim for refund, who is required
  under   paragraph   four  of  subsection  (g)  of  section  six  hundred
  fifty-eight of this article to: (i) retain a  copy  of  such  return  or
  claim  for  refund or retain on a list the name and taxpayer identifying
  number of the taxpayer for whom such return  or  claim  for  refund  was
  prepared  and  (ii) make such copy or list available for inspection upon
  request by the commissioner, and who fails to comply with the  retention
  requirement  or who complies with the retention requirement but fails to
  comply with such request by the commissioner,  shall  be  subject  to  a
  penalty  of fifty dollars for each such failure, unless it is shown that
  such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful  neglect.
  The  maximum  penalty  imposed  under  this paragraph on any person with
  respect to any calendar  year  shall  not  exceed  twenty-five  thousand
  dollars.
    * (5)  Failure  to  electronically  file.  If a tax return preparer is
  required to file returns electronically pursuant  to  paragraph  ten  of
  subsection  (g)  of section six hundred fifty-eight of this article, and
  such preparer fails to file one or more of such returns  electronically,
  then  such  preparer  shall be subject to a penalty of fifty dollars for
  each such failure to electronically file a return, unless  it  is  shown
  that  such  failure  is  due  to reasonable cause and not due to willful
  neglect.
    * NB Effective January 1, 2025
    (6) For purposes of this subsection, the term  "tax  return  preparer"
  shall  have  the same meaning as defined in paragraph five of subsection
  (g) of section six hundred fifty-eight of this article.
    (v) Failure to perform certain acts  with  respect  to  the  quarterly
  combined  withholding, wage reporting and unemployment insurance return.
  (1) Failure to file. (A) Delinquency. (i) General. If an employer  fails
  to   file   a   quarterly   combined  withholding,  wage  reporting  and
  unemployment insurance return, or any portion thereof,  as  required  by
  paragraph  four of subsection (a) of section six hundred seventy-four of
  this article, then such employer shall, unless it  is  shown  that  such
  failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, pay a
  penalty  equal  to the greater of one thousand dollars or the product of
  fifty dollars multiplied by the number of employees shown  on  the  last
  quarterly   combined   withholding,   wage  reporting  and  unemployment
  insurance return filed by such employer, or if no such return  has  been
  filed, the number of employees may be estimated by the commissioner from
  any  information  in  the commissioner's possession. The total amount of
  the penalty imposed by this clause on an employer for any  such  failure
  shall not exceed ten thousand dollars.
    (ii)  Coordination  of delinquency penalty with other additions to tax
  and penalties for failure to  file.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in
  subparagraph  (C)  of  this  paragraph,  an employer failing to file the
  quarterly  combined  withholding,  wage   reporting   and   unemployment
  insurance  return,  or any portion thereof, shall only be liable for the
  penalty prescribed by this subparagraph;  such  employer  shall  not  be
  liable for the addition to tax prescribed by paragraph one of subsection
  (a)  of  this  section or for the penalty prescribed by paragraph (b) of
  subdivision two of section five hundred eighty-one of the labor law.


   (B) Late filing. (i) Within thirty days  of  notice.  If  an  employer
  fails  to  file  a  quarterly  combined  withholding, wage reporting and
  unemployment insurance return, or any portion thereof, by the  due  date
  prescribed  by  paragraph  four of subsection (a) of section six hundred
  seventy-four  of this article, but files such return or any such portion
  thereof within thirty days after the date the department sends notice of
  such failure to such  employer  by  certified  mail,  then  the  penalty
  prescribed  by  subparagraph  (A)  of this paragraph shall be abated. In
  addition, such employer shall not be liable  for  the  addition  to  tax
  prescribed  by  paragraph  one of subsection (a) of this section and the
  penalty prescribed by paragraph (b) of subdivision two of  section  five
  hundred  eighty-one  of  the labor law. Provided, however, such employer
  shall remain liable  for  the  other  additions  to  tax  prescribed  by
  subsection  (a)  of this section, if applicable. Provided, further, that
  where such employer fails to  file  such  return  or  any  such  portion
  thereof  by  the due date prescribed by paragraph four of subsection (a)
  of section six hundred seventy-four of this article but  is  not  liable
  for  the  penalty  prescribed  by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for
  such failure because such employer complied with the provisions of  this
  clause  or  clause  (iii)  of  this  subparagraph, and where within four
  successive calendar quarters of such initial  failure  to  file  by  the
  prescribed  due  date,  such employer again fails to file such return or
  portion thereof by such due date, then the  provisions  of  this  clause
  relating  to  abatement and non-imposition of other additions to tax and
  penalties for failure to file shall not apply to any such failure within
  such four successive calendar quarters. In such a case, if such employer
  files such return or portion thereof within thirty days after  the  date
  the  department  sends  notice of such second failure by certified mail,
  such employer shall be liable for a penalty equal to the lesser  of  the
  product  of fifty dollars multiplied by the number of employees actually
  shown on such employer's late filed quarterly combined withholding, wage
  reporting and unemployment insurance  return,  but  not  less  than  one
  thousand  dollars  nor more than ten thousand dollars, or the sum of the
  addition to tax prescribed by paragraph one of subsection  (a)  of  this
  section  and  the penalty prescribed by paragraph (b) of subdivision two
  of section five hundred eighty-one of the labor law.
    (ii) After thirty days of notice. If  an  employer  fails  to  file  a
  quarterly   combined   withholding,   wage  reporting  and  unemployment
  insurance return, or any portion thereof, by the due date prescribed  by
  paragraph  four of subsection (a) of section six hundred seventy-four of
  this article, but files such return or any  such  portion  thereof  more
  than  thirty  days  after  the  date the department sends notice of such
  failure to file to such employer by certified mail, then  such  employer
  shall  be  liable  for  a penalty equal to the greater of the product of
  fifty dollars multiplied by the number of employees  actually  shown  on
  such   employer's   late  filed  quarterly  combined  withholding,  wage
  reporting and unemployment insurance  return,  but  not  less  than  one
  thousand  dollars  nor more than ten thousand dollars, or the sum of the
  addition to tax prescribed by paragraph one of subsection  (a)  of  this
  section  and  the penalty prescribed by paragraph (b) of subdivision two
  of section five hundred eighty-one of the labor law.
    (iii) Late filing prior to notice. If an  employer  fails  to  file  a
  quarterly   combined   withholding,   wage  reporting  and  unemployment
  insurance return, or portion thereof, by  the  due  date  prescribed  by
  paragraph  four of subsection (a) of section six hundred seventy-four of
  this article but files such return or any such  portion  thereof  before
  the  department  sends notice of such failure to file by certified mail,
  then the penalty prescribed by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  shall


 not  be  imposed. In addition, such employer shall not be liable for the
  addition to tax prescribed by paragraph one of subsection  (a)  of  this
  section  and  the penalty prescribed by paragraph (b) of subdivision two
  of  section five hundred eighty-one of the labor law. Provided, however,
  such employer shall  remain  liable  for  the  other  additions  to  tax
  prescribed  by  subsection (a) of this section, if applicable. Provided,
  further, that where such employer fails to file such return or any  such
  portion  thereof  by  the  due  date  prescribed  by  paragraph  four of
  subsection (a) of section six hundred seventy-four of this  article  but
  is  not  liable  for  the penalty prescribed by subparagraph (A) of this
  paragraph for such failure  because  such  employer  complied  with  the
  provisions  of this clause or clause (i) of this subparagraph, and where
  within four successive calendar quarters of such initial failure to file
  by the prescribed due date, such  employer  again  fails  to  file  such
  return or any such portion thereof by such due date, then the provisions
  of  this  clause  relating  to  non-imposition  of  penalties  and other
  additions to tax for failure to file shall not apply to any such failure
  within such four successive calendar quarters. In such a case,  if  such
  employer  files  such  return  or  portion thereof before the department
  sends notice of such failure by certified mail, such employer  shall  be
  liable for a penalty equal to the lesser of the product of fifty dollars
  multiplied  by the number of employees actually shown on such employer's
  late  filed  quarterly  combined   withholding,   wage   reporting   and
  unemployment  insurance  return,  but not less than one thousand dollars
  nor more than ten thousand dollars, or the sum of the  addition  to  tax
  prescribed  by  paragraph  one of subsection (a) of this section and the
  penalty prescribed by paragraph (b) of subdivision two of  section  five
  hundred eighty-one of the labor law.
    (C)  Audit  following  failure to file. If an employer fails to file a
  quarterly  combined  withholding,  wage   reporting   and   unemployment
  insurance  return and an audit is subsequently commenced with respect to
  such employer by the department, the department of labor or  both,  such
  employer  shall,  in  addition to the penalty prescribed by subparagraph
  (A) of this paragraph, be liable for the addition to tax  prescribed  by
  paragraph  one of subsection (a) of this section, the penalty prescribed
  by paragraph (b) of subdivision two of section five  hundred  eighty-one
  of the labor law, or both, as applicable.
    (D)  Protests and collection. The department of labor shall adjudicate
  all disputes regarding the imposition of the penalty prescribed by  this
  paragraph  (whether  alone  or  in  conjunction with the addition to tax
  prescribed by paragraph one of subsection (a) of this  section  and  the
  penalty  prescribed  by paragraph (b) of subdivision two of section five
  hundred eighty-one of the labor law), in accordance with the  provisions
  contained  in article eighteen of the labor law; provided, however, that
  the  department  shall  adjudicate  disputes  in  accordance  with   the
  procedures  prescribed  by this chapter where (i) an employer only fails
  to file the portion of a quarterly combined withholding, wage  reporting
  and unemployment insurance return relating to withholding reconciliation
  information, (ii) the penalty prescribed by clause (iii) of subparagraph
  (B)  of  this  paragraph is imposed, or (iii) the department conducts an
  audit described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph  with  respect  to
  withholding tax liability. Once the penalty prescribed by this paragraph
  is  finally  determined  and  no  longer  subject  to  administrative or
  judicial review, the amount thereof shall be deemed to be an  obligation
  owed  jointly  to the department and the department of labor, and either
  of such departments may collect  such  amount  in  accordance  with  the
  procedures  prescribed  by this chapter or the labor law, as applicable.
  Any penalty amount so collected shall, if  necessary,  be  allocated  as


 between  the  withholding  tax  program  and  the unemployment insurance
  program, and shall be  deposited  and  disposed  of  by  the  respective
  department in accordance with applicable law.
    (3)  Failure  to  provide  complete  and  correct employee withholding
  reconciliation information. In the case of a failure by an  employer  to
  provide  complete and correct quarterly withholding information relating
  to individual  employees  on  a  quarterly  combined  withholding,  wage
  reporting  and  unemployment  insurance  return  covering  each calendar
  quarter of a year, such employer shall, unless it  is  shown  that  such
  failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, pay a
  penalty  equal  to  the product of one hundred dollars multiplied by the
  number  of  employees  for  whom  such  information  is  incomplete   or
  incorrect;  provided,  however,  that  if  the  number of such employees
  cannot be determined  from  the  quarterly  combined  withholding,  wage
  reporting  and  unemployment  insurance  return,  the  commissioner  may
  utilize any information in the commissioner's possession in making  such
  determination.  The total amount of the penalty imposed pursuant to this
  paragraph on an employer for any such failure for each calendar  quarter
  of a year shall not exceed twenty thousand dollars.
    (4)  Failure  to  provide  complete  and correct quarterly withholding
  information not relating to individual  employees.  In  the  case  of  a
  failure  by  an  employer  to  provide  complete  and  correct quarterly
  withholding information  not  relating  to  individual  employees  on  a
  quarterly   combined   withholding,   wage  reporting  and  unemployment
  insurance return, such employer shall, unless  it  is  shown  that  such
  failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, pay a
  penalty equal to five percent of the quarterly withholding tax liability
  required  to  be  shown by such employer for the quarter covered by such
  return, or if such liability required to be shown by such  employer  for
  the  quarter  cannot  be ascertained, the commissioner may estimate such
  liability from any information in the commissioner's possession. If such
  employer provides complete and correct quarterly withholding information
  not relating to  individual  employees  within  thirty  days  after  the
  department  sends  notice  of  such failure to the employer by certified
  mail, then such penalty shall be abated. No penalty under this paragraph
  shall be imposed if the  department  is  able  to  properly  verify  and
  reconcile   withholding   and   wage  reporting  information  using  the
  information furnished by the employer. The total amount of  the  penalty
  imposed  pursuant  to this paragraph on an employer for any such failure
  shall not exceed ten thousand dollars.
    (5) Failure to file using prescribed format. In the case of a  failure
  by  an employer to file a quarterly combined withholding, wage reporting
  and unemployment insurance return using the  format  prescribed  by  the
  department  pursuant to the authority of paragraph two of subsection (d)
  of section six hundred  fifty-eight  of  this  article  and  regulations
  promulgated  thereunder,  such  employer  shall, unless it is shown that
  such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful  neglect,
  pay  a  penalty  equal to the product of fifty dollars multiplied by the
  number of employees required  to  be  shown  on  such  return.  If  such
  employer  files  such  return  using the prescribed format within thirty
  days after the department sends notice of such failure to  the  employer
  by  certified  mail, then such penalty shall be abated. The total amount
  of the penalty imposed pursuant to this paragraph on an employer for any
  such failure shall not exceed ten thousand dollars.
    (6) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection,  and  except  for
  the  penalties  prescribed  by  paragraph  one  of  subsection  (h)  and
  subsection (k)  of  this  section,  the  penalties  prescribed  by  this


 subsection  shall be in addition to any other penalty or addition to tax
  provided by law.
    (w)   Failure  to  file  report  regarding  newly  hired  or  re-hired
  employees.   If any employer required  to  file  a  report  pursuant  to
  section  one  hundred  seventy-one-h  of this chapter fails to file such
  report at the time prescribed therefor, or files a report which fails to
  show the information required  pursuant  to  such  section  one  hundred
  seventy-one-h, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable
  cause  and  not  due  to  willful  neglect, there shall, upon notice and
  demand by the commissioner and in the same manner as tax, be paid by the
  employer a penalty equal to the product of twenty dollars, multiplied by
  the number of employees the employer failed to  report,  but  the  total
  amount imposed on the employer for all such failures during any calendar
  year  shall  not exceed ten thousand dollars. If the failure is a result
  of a conspiracy between the employer and the employee to not supply  the
  required  report  or to supply a false or incomplete report, the penalty
  shall be equal to the product of four hundred fifty  dollars  multiplied
  by the number of employees the employer failed to report.

  information.-- (1) Any person who fails to file, disclose or provide any

  imposed by this subsection with respect to any violation if
    (A)  the  violation  is with respect to a reportable transaction other
  than a listed transaction, and

  requirements of this chapter and effective tax administration.

    (2) If a tax return preparer takes a position on any income tax return
  or  credit  claim  form  that  either  understates  the tax liability or
  increases the claim for a refund  and  the  understatement  of  the  tax
  liability  or  the  increased  claim for refund is due to the preparer's
  reckless or intentional disregard of the law, rules or regulations, such
  preparer shall pay a penalty of between five hundred and  five  thousand
  dollars.  The  amount  of the penalty payable by any person by reason of


 this paragraph shall be reduced by the amount of  the  penalty  paid  by
  such person by reason of paragraph one of this subsection.
    (3)  For  purposes of this subsection, the term "understatement of tax
  liability" means any understatement  of  the  net  amount  payable  with
  respect  to  any  tax imposed under this article or any overstatement of
  the net amount creditable or refundable with respect to any such tax.
    (4) For purposes of this subsection, the term  "tax  return  prepared"
  shall  have  the same meaning as defined in paragraph five of subsection
  (g) of section six hundred fifty-eight of this article.
    (5) This subsection shall not apply if the  penalty  under  subsection
  (r)  of  this section is imposed on the tax return preparer with respect
  to such understatement.

  state by the person on which the penalty is imposed. For purposes of the
  preceding sentence, activities described in clause (i)  of  subparagraph

   §  686. Overpayment.-- (a) General.-- The commissioner of taxation and
  finance, within the applicable period  of  limitations,  may  credit  an
  overpayment  of  income tax and interest on such overpayment against any
  liability in respect of any tax imposed by this chapter, including taxes
  imposed under article twenty-three of this chapter, on  the  person  who
  made  the  overpayment,  against  any  liability  in  respect of any tax
  imposed pursuant to the authority of this chapter or any  other  law  on
  such  person if such tax is administered by the commissioner of taxation
  and finance and, as provided in sections one hundred seventy-one-c,  one
  hundred   seventy-one-d,   one   hundred   seventy-one-e,   one  hundred
  seventy-one-f and one hundred seventy-one-l  of  this  chapter,  against
  past-due  support,  a  past-due  legally enforceable debt, a city of New
  York tax warrant judgment debt, and against the amount of a  default  in
  repayment  of  a guaranteed student, state university or city university
  loan. The balance shall be  refunded  by  the  comptroller  out  of  the
  proceeds of the tax retained by him for such general purpose. Any refund
  under  this  section  shall be made only upon the filing of a return and
  upon a certificate of the commissioner approved by the comptroller.  The
  comptroller,  as  a  condition  precedent  to  the  approval  of  such a
  certificate, may examine into the facts as disclosed by  the  return  of
  the  person  who  made  the  overpayment  and other information and data
  available in the files of the commissioner.
    (b) Excessive withholding.--If the amount allowable as  a  credit  for
  tax  withheld  from  the  taxpayer  exceeds  his tax to which the credit
  relates, the excess shall be considered an overpayment.
    (c) Overpayment by employer.--If there has been an overpayment of  tax
  required   to  be  deducted  and  withheld  under  section  six  hundred
  seventy-one, refund shall be made to the employer  only  to  the  extent
  that  the amount of the overpayment was not deducted and withheld by the
  employer.
    (d)  Overpayment  by  a  deceased   person.--Notwithstanding   section
  thirteen  hundred  ten  of  the  surrogate's  court  procedure  act, any
  overpayment by a decedent not in excess of one thousand dollars  may  be
  refunded  to  the  decedent's surviving spouse unless the return for the
  decedent was filed by his or her executor or administrator.
    (e) Credits against estimated  tax.--The  commissioner  may  prescribe
  regulations providing for the crediting against the estimated income tax
  for  any  taxable  year of the amount determined to be an overpayment of
  the income tax for a preceding  taxable  year.  If  any  overpayment  of
  income  tax  is  so  claimed  as  a credit against estimated tax for the
  succeeding taxable year, such amount shall be considered as a payment of
  the income tax for the succeeding taxable year, and no claim for  credit
  or  refund of such overpayment shall be allowed for the taxable year for
  which the overpayment arises, except upon request to the commissioner on
  or before the last day prescribed for the filing of the return  for  the
  succeeding taxable year, determined with regard to any extension of time
  granted.   If  good  cause  is  shown  for  reversing  the  credit,  the
  commissioner may, in his  or  her  discretion,  credit  the  overpayment
  against   a  liability  or  refund  the  overpayment  without  interest.
  Provided, the person who made the overpayment will not  be  relieved  of
  liability  for  any  penalty  imposed  for  a consequent underpayment of
  estimated tax for the succeeding  taxable  year.  The  decision  of  the
  commissioner  to  grant  or deny the request is final and not subject to
  further administrative or judicial review.
    (f) Rule where no tax liability.--If there is no tax liability  for  a
  period  in respect of which an amount is paid as income tax, such amount
  shall be considered an overpayment.


   (g) Assessment and collection after limitation period.--If any  amount
  of  income  tax  is  assessed  or  collected after the expiration of the
  period of limitations properly applicable thereto, such amount shall  be
  considered an overpayment.
    (h)  Cross  reference.  For  provision  barring application of article
  fifty-two of the civil practice law  and  rules  to  any  amount  to  be
  refunded or credited to a taxpayer, see section seven of this chapter.
    (i) Overpayment.--In case of an overpayment of tax required to be paid
  by  an entity as an estimated tax under paragraph four of subsection (c)
  of section six hundred fifty-eight of this article, a  refund  shall  be
  made  to  such  entity  only  to  the  extent  that  such overpayment is
  attributable to a partner, member or shareholder for whom the entity  is
  not required to pay such estimated tax.




   §  687.  Limitations  on  credit or refund.-- (a) General.-- Claim for
  credit or refund of an overpayment of income tax shall be filed  by  the
  taxpayer within (i) three years from the time the return was filed, (ii)
  two  years  from  the time the tax was paid, or (iii) in the case of any
  overpayment arising from  an  erroneous  denial  by  the  department  of
  environmental  conservation of a certification of completion pursuant to
  section 27-1419 of the environmental conservation law,  two  years  from
  the  time  a  final  determination  to  the  effect that such denial was
  erroneous is made and is no longer subject to judicial review, whichever
  of such periods expires the latest, or if no return  was  filed,  within
  two  years  from the time the tax was paid. If the claim is filed within
  the three year period, the amount of the  credit  or  refund  shall  not
  exceed  the  portion  of the tax paid within the three years immediately
  preceding the filing of the claim plus the period of  any  extension  of
  time  for  filing  the  return  unless  such  claim is for a credit or a
  portion thereof provided pursuant to paragraph two or four of subsection
  (c), paragraph two or four  of  subsection  (d)  or  subsection  (e)  of
  section  six  hundred  six  of  this  chapter. If the claim is not filed
  within the three year period, but is filed within the two  year  period,
  the  amount  of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the
  tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the  filing  of  the
  claim  unless  such  claim is for a credit or a portion thereof provided
  pursuant to paragraph two or four of subsection (c),  paragraph  two  or
  four  of  subsection (d) or subsection (e) of section six hundred six of
  this chapter. In the case of a claim for credit or refund  filed  within
  the  period prescribed in paragraph (iii) of this subsection, the amount
  of the credit or refund may exceed the portion of the  tax  paid  within
  the  applicable  period  specified  in  the  two  immediately  preceding
  sentences, but only to the extent  of  the  amount  of  the  overpayment
  attributable  to  the  denial  described  in  such  paragraph. Except as
  otherwise provided in this section, if no claim is filed, the amount  of
  a  credit or refund shall not exceed the amount which would be allowable
  if a claim had been filed on the date the credit or refund is allowed.
    (b) Extension  of  time  by  agreement.--If  an  agreement  under  the
  provisions  of  paragraph  (2)  of subsection (c) of section six hundred
  eighty-three (extending the period for assessment of income tax) is made
  within the period prescribed in subsection (a) for the filing of a claim
  for credit or refund, the period  for  filing  a  claim  for  credit  or
  refund,  or  for making credit or refund if no claim is filed, shall not
  expire prior to six months after the expiration  of  the  period  within
  which  an  assessment  may  be  made  pursuant  to  the agreement or any
  extension thereof. The amount of such credit or refund shall not  exceed
  the  portion  of  the  tax paid after the execution of the agreement and
  before the filing of the claim or the making of the credit or refund, as
  the case may be, plus the portion of the  tax  paid  within  the  period
  which would be applicable under subsection (a) if a claim had been filed
  on the date the agreement was executed.
    (c)  Notice  of  federal change or correction.-- A claim for credit or
  refund of any overpayment of tax attributable to  a  federal  change  or
  correction  required  to  be  reported  pursuant  to section six hundred
  fifty-nine shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the time
  the notice of such change or  correction  or  such  amended  return  was
  required  to  be filed with the commissioner of taxation and finance. If
  the report or amended return required by section six hundred  fifty-nine
  is not filed within the ninety day period therein specified, no interest
  shall  be  payable  on any claim for credit or refund of the overpayment
  attributable to the federal change or correction.  The  amount  of  such
  credit  or  refund  shall  not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax


 attributable to such federal change, correction or items amended on  the
  taxpayer's  amended federal income tax return. This subsection shall not
  affect the time within which or the amount for which a claim for  credit
  or refund may be filed apart from this subsection.
    (d) Overpayment attributable to net operating loss carryback.--A claim
  for  credit or refund of so much of an overpayment as is attributable to
  the application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback  shall
  be  filed within three years from the time the return was due (including
  extensions thereof) for the taxable year of  the  loss,  or  within  the
  period  prescribed in subsection (b) in respect of such taxable year, or
  within the period prescribed in subsection  (c),  where  applicable,  in
  respect  of  the taxable year to which the net operating loss is carried
  back, whichever expires the latest.
    (e) Failure to file claim  within  prescribed  period.--No  credit  or
  refund shall be allowed or made, except as provided in subsection (f) of
  this  section or subsection (d) of section six hundred ninety, after the
  expiration of the applicable period  of  limitation  specified  in  this
  article,  unless  a  claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer
  within such period. Any later credit shall be void and any later  refund
  erroneous.  No  period  of  limitations specified in any other law shall
  apply to the recovery by a taxpayer of moneys paid in respect  of  taxes
  under this article.
    (f)  Effect  of petition to tax commission.--If a notice of deficiency
  for a taxable year has been mailed to the  taxpayer  under  section  six
  hundred  eighty-one and if the taxpayer files a timely petition with the
  tax commission under section six hundred eighty-nine, it  may  determine
  that  the taxpayer has made an overpayment for such year (whether or not
  it also determines a deficiency for such year). No  separate  claim  for
  credit  or  refund for such year shall be filed, and no credit or refund
  for such year shall be allowed or made, except--
    (1) as to overpayments determined by a decision of the tax  commission
  which has become final; and
    (2)  as  to  any  amount  collected in excess of an amount computed in
  accordance with the decision of the  tax  commission  which  has  become
  final; and
    (3) as to any amount collected after the period of limitation upon the
  making of levy for collection has expired; and
    (4)  as  to  any  amount claimed as a result of a change or correction
  described in subsection (c).
    (g) Limit on amount of credit or refund.--The  amount  of  overpayment
  determined  under  subsection  (f)  shall,  when the decision of the tax
  commission has become final, be credited or refunded in accordance  with
  subsection  (a)  of  section six hundred eighty-six and shall not exceed
  the amount of tax which the tax commission determines  as  part  of  its
  decision was paid--
    (1) after the mailing of the notice of deficiency, or
    (2) within the period which would be applicable under subsections (a),
  (b)  or (c), if on the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiency a
  claim had been filed (whether or not filed)  stating  the  grounds  upon
  which the tax commission finds that there is an overpayment.
    (h)  Early  return.--For  purposes  of  this section, any return filed
  before  the  last  day  prescribed  for  the  filing  thereof  shall  be
  considered  as  filed on such last day, determined without regard to any
  extension of time granted the taxpayer.
    (i) Prepaid income tax.--For purposes of this section, any tax paid by
  the taxpayer before the last day prescribed for its payment, any  income
  tax  withheld from the taxpayer during any calendar year, and any amount
  paid by the taxpayer as estimated income tax for a taxable year shall be


 deemed to have been paid by him on the fifteenth day of the fourth month
  following the close of his taxable  year  with  respect  to  which  such
  amount constitutes a credit or payment.
    (j) Return and payment of withholding tax.--Notwithstanding subsection
  (h), for purposes of this section with respect to any withholding tax--
    (1)  if  a return for any period ending with or within a calendar year
  is filed before April fifteenth of the succeeding  calendar  year,  such
  return  shall  be considered filed on April fifteenth of such succeeding
  calendar year; and
    (2) if a tax with respect  to  remuneration  paid  during  any  period
  ending  with or within a calendar year is paid before April fifteenth of
  the succeeding calendar year, such tax shall be considered paid on April
  fifteenth of such succeeding calendar year.
    (k) Running of periods  of  limitation  suspended  while  taxpayer  is
  unable to manage financial affairs due to disability. -- (1) In the case
  of  an  individual  taxpayer,  the  running  of the periods specified in
  subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall be suspended  during
  any period of such individual's life that such individual is financially
  disabled.  For purposes of this subsection, an individual taxpayer is an
  individual  who  is subject to any state or local personal income tax or
  surcharge administered by the commissioner.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph one of this  subsection,  an  individual
  taxpayer  is financially disabled if such individual is unable to manage
  his or her financial affairs  by  reason  of  a  medically  determinable
  physical  or  mental impairment of that individual which can be expected
  to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for  a
  continuous  period  of  not less than twelve months. An individual shall
  not be considered to  have  such  an  impairment  unless  proof  of  the
  existence   thereof  is  furnished  in  such  form  and  manner  as  the
  commissioner may require.
    (3) An  individual  taxpayer  shall  not  be  treated  as  financially
  disabled  during  any  period that such individual's spouse or any other
  person is authorized to act on behalf of such  individual  in  financial
  matters.
    (l)  Cross  reference.--  For  provision barring refund of overpayment
  credited against tax of a succeeding year, except for good cause  shown,
  see subsection (e) of section six hundred eighty-six.




   §  688.  Interest  on  overpayment.--(a) General.--Notwithstanding the
  provisions of section sixteen of the state finance law,  interest  shall
  be  allowed  and  paid  as  follows  at  the overpayment rate set by the
  commissioner pursuant to section six hundred ninety-seven, or if no rate
  is set, at the rate of six per cent per annum upon  any  overpayment  in
  respect of the tax imposed by this article:
    (1)  from  the  date  of  the overpayment to the due date of an amount
  against which a credit is taken;
    (2) from the date of the overpayment to a date (to  be  determined  by
  the  commissioner) preceding the date of a refund check by not more than
  thirty days, whether or  not  such  refund  check  is  accepted  by  the
  taxpayer  after  tender of such check to the taxpayer. The acceptance of
  such check shall be without prejudice to any right of  the  taxpayer  to
  claim any additional overpayment and interest thereon.
    (3)  Late  returns. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph one or
  two of this subsection, in the case of a return of tax  which  is  filed
  after  the  last date prescribed for filing such return (determined with
  regard to extensions), no interest shall be allowed or paid for any  day
  before the date on which the return is filed.
    (4)  Interest  on  certain  refunds.  To  the  extent  provided for in
  regulations promulgated by the commissioner of taxation and finance,  if
  an  item  of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit is changed from the
  taxable year or period in which it is reported to the  taxable  year  or
  period  in which it belongs and the change results in an underpayment in
  a taxable year or period and an overpayment in some other  taxable  year
  or  period,  the  provisions  of paragraph three of this subsection with
  respect to an overpayment shall not be applicable to the extent that the
  limitation in such paragraph on the right to interest would result in  a
  taxpayer not being allowed interest for a length of time with respect to
  an  overpayment  while  being  required to pay interest on an equivalent
  amount of the related underpayment. However, this paragraph shall not be
  construed as limiting  or  mitigating  the  effect  of  any  statute  of
  limitations  or  any other provision of law relating to the authority of
  such commissioner to issue a notice of deficiency or to allow  a  credit
  or refund on an overpayment.
    (5) Amounts of less than five dollars. No interest shall be allowed or
  paid if the amount thereof is less than five dollars.
    (b)  Advance  payment of tax, payment of estimated tax, and credit for
  income tax withholding.--The provisions of subsections (h)  and  (i)  of
  section  six  hundred eighty-seven applicable in determining the date of
  payment of tax for purposes of determining the period of limitations  on
  credit or refund, shall be applicable in determining the date of payment
  for purposes of this section.
    (c)   Income   tax   refund   within  forty-five  days  of  claim  for
  overpayment.--If any overpayment of  tax  imposed  by  this  article  is
  credited  or  refunded  within  forty-five  days  after  the  last  date
  prescribed (or permitted by extension of time) for filing the return  of
  such tax on which such overpayment was claimed or within forty-five days
  after  such  return  was filed, whichever is later, or within six months
  after a demand is filed pursuant to paragraph six of subsection  (b)  of
  section  six  hundred  fifty-one  of  this chapter, no interest shall be
  allowed under this section on any such  overpayment.  In  regard  to  an
  amended return claiming such overpayment or a claim for credit or refund
  on  which  such overpayment was claimed, if such overpayment is refunded
  within forty-five days of filing such return or such claim, no  interest
  shall  be allowed from the date such return or such claim is filed until
  the day the refund is made. For purposes of this subsection, any amended
  return or  claim  for  credit  or  refund  filed  before  the  last  day


 prescribed  (or  permitted  by  extension of time) for the filing of the
  return of tax for such year shall be considered as filed  on  such  last
  day.
    (d)  Refund  of  income tax caused by carryback.--For purposes of this
  section, if any overpayment of tax imposed by this article results  from
  a  carryback  of  a net operating loss, such overpayment shall be deemed
  not to have been made prior to the filing date for the taxable  year  in
  which  such  net  operating  loss  arises.  Such  filing  date  shall be
  determined without regard to extensions of time to file. For purposes of
  subsection (c) of this section any overpayment described herein shall be
  treated as an overpayment for the loss year and such subsection shall be
  applied with respect to such overpayment by treating the return for  the
  loss  year  as not filed before claim for such overpayment is filed. The
  term "loss year" means the taxable year in which such loss arises.
    (e) No interest until return in processible form.
    (1) For purposes of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, a  return
  shall not be treated as filed until it is filed in processible form.
    (2) For purposes of paragraph one of this subsection, a return is in a
  processible form if--
    (A) such return is filed on a permitted form, and
    (B) such return contains--
    (i)  the  taxpayer's  name,  address,  and  identifying number and the
  required signatures, and
    (ii) sufficient required information (whether  on  the  return  or  on
  required  attachments)  to  permit  the mathematical verification of tax
  liability shown on the return.
    (f) Overpayment  credited  against  past-due  support,  or  against  a
  past-due  legally  enforceable  debt,  or a city of New York tax warrant
  judgment debt, or defaulted guaranteed student, state university or city
  university loans.--If interest is payable pursuant to  this  section  on
  that  portion  of an overpayment of tax imposed by this article which is
  certified by the commissioner of taxation and finance to the comptroller
  as the amount to be credited against  past-due  support,  or  against  a
  past-due  legally  enforceable  debt,  or a city of New York tax warrant
  judgment debt, or the amount of a default in repayment of  a  guaranteed
  student,  state  university or city university loan, as the case may be,
  pursuant to the provisions of section one hundred seventy-one-c, section
  one hundred seventy-one-d, section one  hundred  seventy-one-e,  section
  one  hundred  seventy-one-f or section one hundred seventy-one-l of this
  chapter, such portion  of  such  an  overpayment  shall  cease  to  bear
  interest on the date of such certification.
    (g)  Cross-reference.--For  provision  with  respect to interest after
  failure to file notice of  federal  change  under  section  six  hundred
  fifty-nine, see subsection (c) of section six hundred eighty-seven.
    (h)  Notwithstanding any other provisions in this section, for taxable
  years beginning on or after January first, two thousand eight and before
  January first, two  thousand  nine,  interest  will  be  allowed  on  an
  overpayment on any return or report on which one or more empire zone tax
  credits  are  claimed, only from the one hundred eightieth day after the
  taxpayer files with the department an empire zone retention  certificate
  issued pursuant to subdivision (w) of section nine hundred fifty-nine of
  the  general  municipal  law  to the empire zone enterprise which is the
  basis for the tax credit or credits claimed on the return or report.




   §  689.  Petition  to  tax  commission.--(a)  General.--The  form of a
  petition to the tax commission, and further proceedings before  the  tax
  commission  in  any case initiated by the filing of a petition, shall be
  governed by such  rules  as  the  tax  commission  shall  prescribe.  No
  petition  shall  be denied in whole or in part without opportunity for a
  hearing on reasonable prior notice. Such hearing shall be  conducted  by
  one  or  more  members  of  the  tax commission, or by a hearing officer
  designated by the tax commission to take evidence and report to the  tax
  commission.  The  tax  commissioners  shall,  acting  as a body, jointly
  decide the case as quickly as practicable. Notice of the decision  shall
  be  mailed  promptly  to the taxpayer by certified or registered mail at
  his last known  address,  and  such  notice  shall  set  forth  the  tax
  commission's  findings  of  fact and a brief statement of the grounds of
  decision in each case decided in whole  or  in  part  adversely  to  the
  taxpayer.
    (b) Petition for redetermination of a deficiency.--Within ninety days,
  or one hundred fifty days if the notice is addressed to a person outside
  of  the  United  States,  after  the mailing of the notice of deficiency
  authorized by section six hundred eighty-one, the taxpayer  may  file  a
  petition   with   the  tax  commission  for  a  redetermination  of  the
  deficiency. Such petition may also assert a claim  for  refund  for  the
  same taxable year or years, subject to the limitations of subsection (g)
  of section six hundred eighty-seven.
    (c)  Petition for refund.--A taxpayer may file a petition with the tax
  commission for the amounts asserted in a claim for refund if--
    (1) the taxpayer has filed a timely claim  for  refund  with  the  tax
  commission,
    (2)  the  taxpayer  has not previously filed with the tax commission a
  timely petition under subsection (b) for the same  taxable  year  unless
  the  petition  under  this  subsection  relates  to a separate claim for
  credit or refund properly filed under  subsection  (f)  of  section  six
  hundred eighty-seven, and
    (3)  either  (A) six months have expired since the claim was filed, or
  (B) the tax commission has mailed to  the  taxpayer,  by  registered  or
  certified  mail,  a  notice of disallowance of such claim in whole or in
  part.
    (4) Notwithstanding paragraph three of this  subsection,  no  petition
  may  be filed by a taxpayer claiming a refund of one or more empire zone
  tax credits for a taxable year beginning on or after January first,  two
  thousand  eight  and  before January first, two thousand nine, until six
  months have expired after the date on which  an  empire  zone  retention
  certificate  was  issued  pursuant  to  subdivision  (w) of section nine
  hundred fifty-nine of the general  municipal  law  to  the  empire  zone
  enterprise  which  is the basis for the tax credit or credits claimed on
  the return or report.
  No petition under this subsection shall be filed  more  than  two  years
  after  the  date of mailing of a notice of disallowance, unless prior to
  the expiration of such two year period it has been extended  by  written
  agreement  between  the  taxpayer  and the tax commission. If a taxpayer
  files a written waiver of the requirement that he be mailed a notice  of
  disallowance,  the  two  year  period  prescribed by this subsection for
  filing a petition for refund shall begin on  the  date  such  waiver  is
  filed.
    (d) Assertion of deficiency after filing petition.--
    (1)  Petition  for redetermination of deficiency.--If a taxpayer files
  with the tax commission a petition for redetermination of a  deficiency,
  the  tax  commission  shall have power to determine a greater deficiency
  than asserted in the notice of deficiency  and  to  determine  if  there


 should  be  assessed  any addition to tax or penalty provided in section
  six hundred eighty-five, if claim therefor is asserted at or before  the
  hearing under rules of the tax commission.
    (2)  Petition  for  refund.--  If  the  taxpayer  files  with  the tax
  commission a petition for credit or refund for a taxable year,  the  tax
  commission may
    (A)  determine  a  deficiency  for  such  year  as  to  any  amount of
  deficiency asserted at or before the hearing  under  rules  of  the  tax
  commission, and within the period in which an assessment would be timely
  under section six hundred eighty-three, or
    (B) deny so much of the amount for which credit or refund is sought in
  the  petition,  as  is  offset  by  other  issues pertaining to the same
  taxable year which are asserted at or before the hearing under rules  of
  the tax commission.
    (3)  Opportunity  to respond.-- A taxpayer shall be given a reasonable
  opportunity to respond to any matters asserted  by  the  tax  commission
  under this subsection.
    (4)  Restriction  on further notices of deficiency. -- If the taxpayer
  files a petition with the tax commission under this section,  no  notice
  of  deficiency  under  section  six hundred eighty-one may thereafter be
  issued by the tax commission for the same taxable year, except  in  case
  of  fraud  or  with  respect  to  a  change or correction required to be
  reported under section six hundred fifty-nine.
    (e) Burden of proof. In any case before the tax commission under  this
  article, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner except for the
  following  issues, as to which the burden of proof shall be upon the tax
  commission:
    (1) whether the petitioner has been guilty of  fraud  with  intent  to
  evade tax;
    (2)  whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property of
  a taxpayer, but not to show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax;
    (3) whether the petitioner is liable for any increase in a  deficiency
  where  such  increase is asserted initially after a notice of deficiency
  was mailed and a petition under this section filed, unless such increase
  in deficiency is the result of a change or  correction  required  to  be
  reported  under  section  six hundred fifty-nine, and of which change or
  correction the tax commission had no notice at the time  it  mailed  the
  notice of deficiency; and
    (4) whether any person is liable for a penalty under subsection (q) or
  (r) of section six hundred eighty-five of this article.
    (f) Evidence of related federal determination.-- Evidence of a federal
  determination  relating  to  issues  raised  in  a  case  before the tax
  commission  under  this  section  shall  be  admissible,   under   rules
  established by the tax commission.
    (g) Jurisdiction over other years.-- The tax commission shall consider
  such  facts  with  relation  to  the  taxes  for  other  years as may be
  necessary correctly to determine the tax for the taxable year, but in so
  doing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for
  any other year has been overpaid or underpaid.




   § 690. Review of tax commission decision.--(a) General.--A decision of
  the  tax  appeals  tribunal  shall  be subject to judicial review in the
  manner provided for by section two thousand sixteen of this chapter.
    (b) Judicial review exclusive remedy of  taxpayer.--The  review  of  a
  decision  of  the  tax  commission provided by this section shall be the
  exclusive  remedy  available  to   any   taxpayer   for   the   judicial
  determination  of the liability of the taxpayer for the taxes imposed by
  this article.
    (c) Assessment  pending  review;  review  bond.--Irrespective  of  any
  restrictions  on  the assessment and collection of deficiencies, the tax
  commission may assess a deficiency after the expiration  of  the  period
  specified  in  subsection  (a),  notwithstanding that an application for
  judicial review in respect of such deficiency has been duly made by  the
  taxpayer, unless the taxpayer, at or before the time his application for
  review  is  made,  has  paid  the deficiency, has deposited with the tax
  commission the amount of the deficiency,  or  has  filed  with  the  tax
  commission  a bond (which may be a jeopardy bond under subsection (h) of
  section six hundred ninety-four) in the amount of  the  portion  of  the
  deficiency  (including  interest  and other amounts) in respect of which
  the application for review is made and all costs and charges  which  may
  accrue against him in the prosecution of the proceeding, including costs
  of  all  appeals,  and  with surety approved by a justice of the supreme
  court of the state of New York, conditioned  upon  the  payment  of  the
  deficiency  (including interest and other amounts) as finally determined
  and such costs  and  charges.  If  as  a  result  of  a  waiver  of  the
  restrictions  on  the assessment and collection of a deficiency any part
  of the amount determined by the tax commission is paid after the  filing
  of  the review bond, such bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be
  proportionately reduced.
    (d) Credit, refund or abatement after  review.--If  the  amount  of  a
  deficiency determined by the tax commission is disallowed in whole or in
  part  by the court of review, the amount so disallowed shall be credited
  or refunded to the taxpayer, without the making of claim  therefor,  or,
  if payment has not been made, shall be abated.
    (e)  Date  of  finality  of  division  of tax appeals determination or
  decision.--A  determination  of  an  administrative  law  judge  in  the
  division   of   tax  appeals  shall  become  final  in  accordance  with
  subdivision four of section two thousand ten of this chapter. A decision
  of the tax appeals tribunal shall become final upon  the  expiration  of
  the  period  specified  in  subsection (a) for making an application for
  review, if no such application has been duly made within such  time,  or
  if  such application has been duly made, upon expiration of the time for
  all further judicial review, or upon the rendering by  the  tax  appeals
  tribunal  of  a  decision in accordance with the mandate of the court on
  review. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for  the  purpose  of  making  an
  application  for  review, the decision of the tax appeals tribunal shall
  be deemed final on the date the notice of such  decision  is  served  as
  provided in section two thousand sixteen of this chapter.




   §   691.   Mailing   rules;   holidays;   miscellaneous.--(a)   Timely
  mailing.--(1) If any return,  claim,  statement,  notice,  petition,  or
  other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made,
  within  a  prescribed  period  or  on  or before a prescribed date under
  authority of any provision of this article is, after such period or such
  date, delivered by United States mail to  the  tax  commission,  bureau,
  office,  officer  or  person  with  which  or with whom such document is
  required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to
  be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the  envelope
  shall  be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subsection shall apply
  only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period  or  on  or
  before  the  prescribed  date  for  the  filing of such document, or for
  making the payment, including any extension granted for such  filing  or
  payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail,
  postage  prepaid,  properly  addressed  to  the  tax commission, bureau,
  office, officer or person with  which  or  with  whom  the  document  is
  required  to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to
  be made. If any document or payment is sent by United States  registered
  mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document
  or  payment was delivered to the tax commission, bureau, office, officer
  or person to which or to whom addressed. To  the  extent  that  the  tax
  commission  shall prescribe by regulation, certified mail may be used in
  lieu of registered mail under this section. This subsection shall  apply
  in  the case of postmarks not made by the United States Post Office only
  if and to the extent provided by regulations of the tax commission.
    (2)(A) Any reference in paragraph one of this subsection to the United
  States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
  service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
  pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred two of the internal revenue
  code and any reference in paragraph one of this subsection to a postmark
  by the United States mail shall be treated as including a  reference  to
  any  date  recorded  or  marked  in  the  manner  described  in  section
  seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code  by  a  designated
  delivery  service.   If the commissioner finds that any delivery service
  designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs of  the  state,
  the  commissioner  may  withdraw  such  designation for purposes of this
  article.   The  commissioner  may  also  designate  additional  delivery
  services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the
  internal  revenue code for purposes of this article, or may withdraw any
  such designation if the commissioner finds that a  delivery  service  so
  designated  is  inadequate for the needs of the state.  Any reference in
  paragraph one of this subsection to the  United  States  mail  shall  be
  treated  as  including a reference to any delivery service designated by
  the commissioner and any reference in paragraph one of  this  subsection
  to  a postmark by the United States mail shall be treated as including a
  reference to any date recorded or marked  in  the  manner  described  in
  section  seventy-five  hundred  two  of  the  internal revenue code by a
  delivery service designated by the commissioner.
    (B) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated  by  the
  United  States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the
  commissioner pursuant to the same criteria used by  such  secretary  for
  such  designations  pursuant  to section seventy-five hundred two of the
  internal  revenue  code,  shall  be  included  within  the  meaning   of
  registered   or  certified  mail  as  used  in  paragraph  one  of  this
  subsection.  If the commissioner finds that any equivalent of registered
  or certified mail designated by such secretary or  the  commissioner  is
  inadequate  for  the  needs  of the state, the commissioner may withdraw
  such designation for purposes of this article.


   (b) Last known address.--For purposes of this  article,  a  taxpayer's
  last  known  address shall be the address given in the last return filed
  by him, unless subsequently to the filing of such  return  the  taxpayer
  shall have notified the tax commission of a change of address.
    (c)  Last  day a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.--When the last day
  prescribed under authority of this article (including any  extension  of
  time)  for  performing  any  act  falls  on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal
  holiday in the state of New York, the performance of such act  shall  be
  considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is
  not a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday.
    (d)  Certificate;  unfiled  return.--For purposes of this chapter, the
  certificate of the tax commission to the effect that a tax has not  been
  paid, that a return has not been filed, or that information has not been
  supplied,  as required by or under the provisions of this article, shall
  be prima facie evidence that such tax  has  not  been  paid,  that  such
  return  has  not  been  filed,  or  that  such  information has not been
  supplied.
    (e) Attorney general; jurisdiction.--The attorney general  shall  have
  concurrent jurisdiction with any district attorney in the prosecution of
  any  offenses  arising  under  article thirty-seven of this chapter with
  respect to the tax imposed under this article.
    (f)  Voter  registration  forms.--The  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance  shall  from  time  to  time  distribute mail voter registration
  forms, designed by the state board of elections,  that  conform  to  the
  requirements  of  subdivision five of section 5-210 of the election law.
  One such registration form shall be included by the commissioner in each
  packet of forms and instructions that the  commissioner  distributes  to
  residents  who  may be required to file a return pursuant to section six
  hundred fifty-one of this article.




   §  692.  Collection,  levy and liens.--(a) Collection procedures.--The
  taxes imposed by this article shall be collected by the tax  commission,
  and  it  may establish the mode or time for the collection of any amount
  due it under this article if not otherwise specified. The tax commission
  shall, upon request, give a receipt for any  sum  collected  under  this
  article. The tax commission may authorize banks or trust companies which
  are  depositaries or financial agents of the state to receive and give a
  receipt for any tax imposed under this article in such manner,  at  such
  times,  and  under  such conditions as the tax commission may prescribe;
  and the tax commission shall prescribe the manner, times and  conditions
  under which the receipt of such tax by such banks and trust companies is
  to be treated as payment of such tax to the tax commission.
    (b)  Notice  and  demand for tax.--The tax commission shall as soon as
  practicable give notice to each person liable for  any  amount  of  tax,
  addition  to  tax,  penalty  or  interest,  which  has been assessed but
  remains unpaid, stating the amount and demanding payment  thereof.  Such
  notice  shall be left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such
  person or shall be sent by mail to such  person's  last  known  address.
  Except  where  the  tax  commission  determines that collection would be
  jeopardized by delay, if any tax is assessed  prior  to  the  last  date
  (including  any  date fixed by extension) prescribed for payment of such
  tax, payment of such tax shall not be demanded until after such date.
    (c) Issuance of warrant after notice and demand.--If any person liable
  under this article for the payment of any tax, addition to tax,  penalty
  or  interest  neglects  or  refuses  to  pay  the same within twenty-one
  calendar days after notice and demand therefor is given to  such  person
  under  subsection  (b)  of this section (ten business days if the amount
  for which such notice and demand is made equals or exceeds  one  hundred
  thousand  dollars), the commissioner may within six years after the date
  of such assessment issue a warrant  under  the  commissioner's  official
  seal  directed  to  the  sheriff  of  any county of the state, or to any
  officer or employee of the department, commanding him to levy  upon  and
  sell  such  person's  real  and personal property for the payment of the
  amount assessed, with the cost of executing the warrant  and  to  return
  such  warrant  to  the  commissioner  and  pay  to  him or her the money
  collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt  of  the
  warrant.  If  the  commissioner  finds that the collection of the tax or
  other amount is in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment  of
  such  tax may be made by the commissioner and upon failure or refusal to
  pay such tax or other  amount  the  commissioner  may  issue  a  warrant
  without  regard  to  the  twenty-one  day  period  (or ten-day period if
  applicable) provided in this subsection.
    (d) Copy of warrant to be filed and lien to be  created.--Any  sheriff
  or officer or employee who receives a warrant under subsection (c) shall
  within  five  days  thereafter  file  a  copy  with  the  clerk  of  the
  appropriate county. The clerk shall  thereupon  enter  in  the  judgment
  docket,  in  the  column  for judgment debtors, the name of the taxpayer
  mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the  tax  or  other
  amounts  for  which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is
  filed; and such amount shall thereupon be a lien upon the title  to  and
  interest in real, personal and other property of the taxpayer. Such lien
  shall not apply to personal property unless such warrant is filed in the
  department of state.
    (e) Judgment.--When a warrant has been filed with the county clerk the
  tax  commission  shall,  in  the right of the people of the state of New
  York, be deemed to have obtained judgment against the taxpayer  for  the
  tax or other amounts.


   (f)  Execution.--The  sheriff  or  officer or employee shall thereupon
  proceed upon the warrant in all respects, with like effect, and  in  the
  same  manner  prescribed  by law in respect to executions issued against
  property upon judgments of a court of record, and  a  sheriff  shall  be
  entitled  to the same fees for his services in executing the warrant, to
  be collected  in  the  same  manner.  An  officer  or  employee  of  the
  department of taxation and finance may proceed in any county or counties
  of  this  state  and shall have all the powers of execution conferred by
  law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee  or  compensation  in
  excess  of  actual expenses paid in connection with the execution of the
  warrant.
    (g)  Taxpayer  not  a  resident.  Where  a  notice  and  demand  under
  subsection  (b)  shall  have  been given to a taxpayer who is not then a
  resident,  and  it  appears  to  the  tax  commission  that  it  is  not
  practicable to find in this state property of the taxpayer sufficient to
  pay the entire balance of tax or other amount owing by such taxpayer who
  is  not  then  a  resident,  the  tax commission may, in accordance with
  subsection (c), issue a warrant directed to an officer  or  employee  of
  the department of taxation and finance, a copy of which warrant shall be
  mailed by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer at his last known
  address,  subject to the rules for mailing provided in subsection (a) of
  section six hundred eighty-one. Such warrant shall command  the  officer
  or  employee to proceed in Albany county, and he shall, within five days
  after receipt of the warrant, file the warrant and obtain a judgment  in
  accordance with this section. Thereupon the tax commission may authorize
  the  institution  of  any action or proceeding to collect or enforce the
  judgment in any place and by any procedure that a civil judgment of  the
  supreme  court  of the state of New York could be collected or enforced.
  The tax commission may also, in  its  discretion,  designate  agents  or
  retain  counsel  for the purpose of collecting, outside the state of New
  York, any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties  or  interest  which
  have  been  assessed  under  this  article against taxpayers who are not
  residents of this state, may fix the compensation  of  such  agents  and
  counsel  to  be  paid  out  of  money appropriated or otherwise lawfully
  available for payment thereof, and may require of them  bonds  or  other
  security  for the faithful performance of their duties, in such form and
  in such amount as the tax commission shall deem proper and sufficient.
    (h) Action by state for recovery of taxes.--Action may be  brought  by
  the  attorney  general at the instance of the tax commission in the name
  of the state to recover the amount of any  unpaid  taxes,  additions  to
  tax,  penalties  or interest which have been assessed under this article
  within six years prior to the date the action is commenced.
    (i) Release of  lien.--The  tax  commission,  if  it  finds  that  the
  interests  of  the  state will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such
  conditions as it may require, may release any property from the lien  of
  any  warrant  for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest
  filed pursuant to this section, and such release may be recorded in  the
  office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed.




   § 693. Transferees.--(a) General.--The liability, at law or in equity,
  of a transferee of property of a taxpayer for any tax, additions to tax,
  penalty  or interest due the tax commission under this article, shall be
  assessed, paid, and collected in the same manner and subject to the same
  provisions and limitations as in the  case  of  the  tax  to  which  the
  liability  relates, except that the period of limitations for assessment
  against the transferee shall be extended by one year for each successive
  transfer, in  order,  from  the  original  taxpayer  to  the  transferee
  involved,  but  not  by more than three years in the aggregate. The term
  transferee includes donee, heir, legatee, devisee and distributee.
    (b) Exceptions.--
    (1) If  before  the  expiration  of  the  period  of  limitations  for
  assessment of liability of the transferee, a claim has been filed by the
  tax  commission  in  any court against the original taxpayer or the last
  preceding transferee based upon the liability of the original  taxpayer,
  then  the  period  of  limitation  for  assessment  of  liability of the
  transferee shall in no event expire prior to one year after  such  claim
  has been finally allowed, disallowed or otherwise disposed of.
    (2) If, before the expiration of the time prescribed in subsection (a)
  or  the  immediately  preceding  paragraph  of  this  subsection for the
  assessment of the liability, the tax commission and the transferee  have
  both  consented  in  writing  to  its  assessment  after  such time, the
  liability may be assessed at any time prior to  the  expiration  of  the
  period  agreed  upon.  The  period  so  agreed  upon  may be extended by
  subsequent agreements in writing  made  before  the  expiration  of  the
  period previously agreed upon. For the purpose of determining the period
  of  limitation  on credit or refund to the transferee of overpayments of
  tax made  by  such  transferee  or  overpayments  of  tax  made  by  the
  transferor  as  to which the transferee is legally entitled to credit or
  refund, such agreement and any extension  thereof  shall  be  deemed  an
  agreement and extension thereof referred to in subsection (b) of section
  six  hundred  eighty-seven.  If  the  agreement  is  executed  after the
  expiration of the  period  of  limitation  for  assessment  against  the
  original taxpayer, then in applying the limitations under subsection (b)
  of  section  six  hundred  eighty-seven  on  the amount of the credit or
  refund, the periods specified in subsection (a) of section  six  hundred
  eighty-seven  shall  be  increased  by  the period from the date of such
  expiration to the date of the agreement.
    (c) Deceased transferor.--If any person is  deceased,  the  period  of
  limitation  for assessment against him shall be the period that would be
  in effect if he had lived.
    (d) Evidence.--Notwithstanding the provisions  of  subsection  (e)  of
  section six hundred ninety-seven the tax commission shall use its powers
  to  make  available  to  the transferee evidence necessary to enable the
  transferee to determine the liability of the original  taxpayer  and  of
  any  preceding  transferees,  but without undue hardship to the original
  taxpayer or preceding transferee. See  subsection  (e)  of  section  six
  hundred eighty-nine for rule as to burden of proof.
    (e)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph one of subsection (e)
  of section six hundred ninety-seven of this part, the  commissioner  may
  furnish  information  relating  to  real  property transfers obtained or
  derived from returns filed pursuant to this article in relation  to  the
  real  estate  transfer  tax, to the extent that such information is also
  required to be reported to the commissioner  by  section  three  hundred
  thirty-three   of  the  real  property  law  and  section  five  hundred
  seventy-four of  the  real  property  tax  law  and  the  rules  adopted
  thereunder,  provided  such information was collected through a combined
  process established pursuant to  an  agreement  entered  into  with  the


 commissioner  pursuant to paragraph viii of subdivision one-e of section
  three hundred thirty-three of the real property  law.  The  commissioner
  may redisclose such information to the extent authorized by section five
  hundred seventy-four of the real property tax law.




   §  694.  Jeopardy  assessment.--(a). Authority for making.--If the tax
  commission believes that the assessment or collection  of  a  deficiency
  will  be  jeopardized by delay, it shall, notwithstanding the provisions
  of  section  six  hundred  eighty-one  and   six   hundred   ninety-six,
  immediately   assess   such  deficiency  (together  with  all  interest,
  penalties and additions to tax provided for  by  law),  and  notice  and
  demand shall be made by the tax commission for the payment thereof.
    (b)  Notice  of deficiency.--If the jeopardy assessment is made before
  any notice in respect of  the  tax  to  which  the  jeopardy  assessment
  relates  has  been mailed under section six hundred eighty-one, then the
  tax commission shall mail a notice under such section within sixty  days
  after the making of the assessment.
    (c) Amount assessable before decision of tax commission.--The jeopardy
  assessment  may  be made in respect of a deficiency greater or less than
  that of which notice is mailed to the taxpayer and whether  or  not  the
  taxpayer  has  theretofore filed a petition with the tax commission. The
  tax commission may, at any time before  rendering  its  decision,  abate
  such  assessment,  or  any unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that it
  believes the assessment to be excessive in amount.   The tax  commission
  may  in its decision redetermine the entire amount of the deficiency and
  of all amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith.
    (d) Amount  assessable  after  decision  of  tax  commission.--If  the
  jeopardy  assessment is made after the decision of the tax commission is
  rendered, such assessment may be made only in respect of the  deficiency
  determined by the tax commission in its decision.
    (e)  Expiration  of right to assess.--A jeopardy assessment may not be
  made after the decision of the tax commission has become final or  after
  the  taxpayer  has made an application for review of the decision of the
  tax commission.
    (f) Collection of unpaid amounts.--When a petition has been filed with
  the tax commission and when the amount which should have  been  assessed
  has been determined by a decision of the tax commission which has become
  final,  then any unpaid portion, the collection of which has been stayed
  by bond, shall be collected as part of the tax upon  notice  and  demand
  from  the  tax  commission,  and any remaining portion of the assessment
  shall be abated. If the amount  already  collected  exceeds  the  amount
  determined  as  the  amount which should have been assessed, such excess
  shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer as provided in section six
  hundred eighty-six without the filing of claim therefor.  If the  amount
  determined as the amount which should have been assessed is greater than
  the  amount actually assessed, then the difference shall be assessed and
  shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and  demand  from  the
  tax commission.
    (g)  Abatement  if  jeopardy  does  not exist.--The tax commission may
  abate the jeopardy assessment if it finds that jeopardy does not  exist.
  Such abatement may not be made after a decision of the tax commission in
  respect  of the deficiency has been rendered or, if no petition is filed
  with the tax commission, after the expiration of the period  for  filing
  such petition. The period of limitation on the making of assessments and
  levy or a proceeding for collection, in respect of any deficiency, shall
  be determined as if the jeopardy assessment so abated had not been made,
  except  that  the running of such period shall in any event be suspended
  for the period from the date  of  such  jeopardy  assessment  until  the
  expiration  of  the  tenth  day  after  the  day  on which such jeopardy
  assessment is abated.
    (h) Bond to stay collection.--The  collection  of  the  whole  or  any
  amount  of  any jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing with the tax
  commission, within such time as may be fixed by regulation, a bond in an


 amount equal to the amount as to which the stay is desired,  conditioned
  upon  the  payment  of  the  amount (together with interest thereon) the
  collection of which is stayed at the time at which, but for  the  making
  of  the  jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due.  Upon the filing
  of the bond the collection of so much  of  the  amount  assessed  as  is
  covered  by  the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the right
  to waive such stay at any time in respect of the whole or  any  part  of
  the  amount  covered  by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any
  part of the amount covered by the bond is paid, then the bond  shall  at
  the  request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. If any portion
  of the jeopardy assessment is abated, or if a notice of deficiency under
  section six hundred eighty-one is mailed to the  taxpayer  in  a  lesser
  amount,   the   bond   shall,   at  the  request  of  the  taxpayer,  be
  proportionately reduced.
    (i) Petition to tax commission.--If  the  bond  is  given  before  the
  taxpayer  has  filed his petition under section six hundred eighty-nine,
  the bond shall contain a further condition that if  a  petition  is  not
  filed  within  the period provided in such section, then the amount, the
  collection of which is stayed by the bond, will be paid  on  notice  and
  demand  at  any  time after the expiration of such period, together with
  interest thereon from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to  the
  date  of  notice  and  demand  under  this subsection. The bond shall be
  conditioned upon the payment of so much of such  assessment  (collection
  of  which  is  stayed by the bond) as is not abated by a decision of the
  tax commission which has become final. If the tax commission  determines
  that  the  amount  assessed is greater than the amount which should have
  been assessed, then the bond shall, at the request of the  taxpayer,  be
  proportionately  reduced  when  the  decision  of  the tax commission is
  rendered.
    (j)  Stay  of  sale  of  seized  property   pending   tax   commission
  decision.--Where  a jeopardy assessment is made, the property seized for
  the collection of the tax shall not be sold--
    (1) if subsection (b) is applicable, prior  to  the  issuance  of  the
  notice  of deficiency and the expiration of the time provided in section
  six hundred eighty-nine for filing a petition with the  tax  commission,
  and
    (2)  if a petition is filed with the tax commission (whether before or
  after the making of such jeopardy assessment), prior to  the  expiration
  of  the  period  during  which the assessment of the deficiency would be
  prohibited if subsection (a) were not applicable.
  Such property may be sold if the taxpayer consents to the  sale,  or  if
  the  tax  commission  determines  that  the expenses of conservation and
  maintenance will greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property  is
  perishable.
    (k)  Interest.--For  the  purpose  of  subsection  (a)  of section six
  hundred eighty-four, the last  date  prescribed  for  payment  shall  be
  determined  without  regard  to any notice and demand for payment issued
  under this section prior to the last date otherwise prescribed for  such
  payment.
    (l)  Early  termination  of taxable year.--If the tax commission finds
  that a taxpayer designs quickly to depart from this state or  to  remove
  his  property  therefrom, or to conceal himself or his property therein,
  or to do any other act tending to  prejudice  or  to  render  wholly  or
  partly ineffectual proceedings to collect the income tax for the current
  or the preceding taxable year unless such proceedings be brought without
  delay,  the  tax  commission  shall  declare the taxable period for such
  taxpayer immediately terminated, and shall cause notice of such  finding
  and  declaration  to  be  given the taxpayer, together with a demand for


 immediate payment  of  the  tax  for  the  taxable  period  so  declared
  terminated  and  of the tax for the preceding taxable year or so much of
  such tax as is unpaid, whether or not the time otherwise allowed by  law
  for  filing  return and paying the tax has expired; and such taxes shall
  thereupon become immediately due and payable. In any proceeding  brought
  to  enforce  payment  of  taxes  made  due  and payable by virtue of the
  provisions of this subsection, the finding of the tax commission made as
  herein provided, whether made after notice to the taxpayer or not, shall
  be for all purposes presumptive evidence of jeopardy.
    (m) Reopening of taxable period.--Notwithstanding the  termination  of
  the taxable period of the taxpayer by the tax commission, as provided in
  subsection  (l),  the tax commission may reopen such taxable period each
  time the taxpayer is found  by  the  tax  commission  to  have  received
  income,  within  the current taxable year, since the termination of such
  period. A taxable period so terminated by  the  tax  commission  may  be
  reopened  by the taxpayer if he files with the tax commission a true and
  accurate return of taxable income and credits allowed under this article
  for such taxable period, together with such other information as the tax
  commission may by regulations prescribe.
    (n) Furnishing of bond  where  taxable  year  is  closed  by  the  tax
  commission.--Payment  of  taxes shall not be enforced by any proceedings
  under the provisions of subsection (l) prior to the  expiration  of  the
  time  otherwise allowed for paying such taxes if the taxpayer furnishes,
  under regulations prescribed by the tax commission, a bond to insure the
  timely making of returns with respect to, and payment of, such taxes  or
  any income taxes for prior years.




   §  695.  Criminal penalties; cross-reference.--For criminal penalties,
  see article thirty-seven of this chapter.




   §  696.  Income  taxes  of  members  of  armed forces, astronauts, and
  victims of certain terrorist attacks.--(a) Time to  be  disregarded.--In
  the  case  of  an  individual  serving in the armed forces of the United
  States, or  serving  in  support  of  such  armed  forces,  in  an  area
  designated by the president of the United States by executive order as a
  "combat  zone" at any time during the period designated by the president
  by executive order as the period of combatant activities in  such  zone,
  or  when  deployed  outside the United States away from the individual's
  permanent duty station while  participating  in  an  operation  that  is
  either  designated  by  the  United  States  secretary  of  defense as a
  "contingency operation" or which became a contingency operation  due  to
  operation  of  law  during  the period of such contingency operation, or
  hospitalized inside or outside the state as a result of injury  received
  while  serving in such an area or operation during such time, the period
  of service in such area or operation,  plus  the  period  of  continuous
  hospitalization inside or outside the state attributable to such injury,
  and the next one hundred eighty days thereafter, shall be disregarded in
  determining,  under this article, in respect of the income tax liability
  (including any interest, penalty,  or  addition  to  the  tax)  of  such
  individual --
    (1)  Whether  any  of the following acts was performed within the time
  prescribed therefor:
    (A) filing any return of income tax (except withholding tax);
    (B) payment  of  any  income  tax  (except  withholding  tax)  or  any
  installment  thereof  or of any other liability to the state, in respect
  thereof;
    (C) filing a petition with the tax commission for credit or refund  or
  for  redetermination  of  a  deficiency,  or application for review of a

    (E) filing a claim for credit or refund of income tax;

  income tax;
    (H) collection, by the tax commission, by levy  or  otherwise  of  the
  amount of any liability in respect of income tax;
    (I)  bringing  suit  by  the  state, or any officer, on its behalf, in
  respect of any liability in respect of income tax; and

  specified  in  regulations  prescribed  under  this  section  by the tax
  commission.
    (2) The amount of any credit or refund.

    (2) If an individual is entitled to the benefits of subsection (a)  of
  this  section  with  respect to any return, amended return, or claim for
  credit or refund, and such return, amended return  or  claim  is  timely
  filed  (determined  after the application of such subsection), paragraph
  three of subsection (a)  and  subsection  (c)  of  section  six  hundred
  eighty-eight of this article shall not apply.
    (c)  Action  taken  before  ascertainment  of  right to benefits.--The
  assessment or collection of the tax imposed by this article  or  of  any
  liability  to  the  state  in  respect  of  such  tax,  or any action or
  proceeding by or on behalf of the state in connection therewith, may  be
  made, taken, begun, or prosecuted in accordance with law, without regard
  to  the  provisions  of subsection (a), unless prior to such assessment,


 collection, action, or proceeding it  is  ascertained  that  the  person
  concerned is entitled to the benefits of subsection (a).
    (d)  Members  of  armed  forces  dying  in action.--In the case of any
  person who dies while in active service as a member of the armed  forces
  of  the  United States, if such death occurred while serving in a combat
  zone during a period of combatant activities in such zone, as  described
  in  subsection (a), or as a result of wounds, disease or injury incurred
  while so serving, the tax imposed by this article shall not  apply  with
  respect to the taxable year in which falls the date of his or her death,
  or  with  respect to any prior taxable year ending on or after the first
  day so served in a combat zone, and no  returns  shall  be  required  in
  behalf  of  such  person or his or her estate for such year; and the tax
  for any such taxable  year  which  is  unpaid  at  the  date  of  death,
  including interest, additions to tax and penalties, if any, shall not be
  assessed  and,  if  assessed,  the  assessment  shall  be abated and, if
  collected, shall be refunded to the legal representative of such  estate
  if   one  has  been  appointed  and  has  qualified,  or,  if  no  legal
  representative has been appointed or has  qualified,  to  the  surviving
  spouse.
    (e) Treatment of individuals performing Desert Shield services. -- (1)
  Any individual who performed Desert Shield services shall be entitled to
  the  benefits  of  subsections  (a)  and (b) of this section in the same
  manner as if such services were services referred to in  subsection  (a)
  of this section.
    (2) For purposes of this subsection, the term "Desert Shield services"
  means  any  services  in  the  armed  forces  of the United States or in
  support of such armed forces if
    (A) such  services  are  performed  in  the  area  designated  by  the
  president of the United States as the "Persian Gulf Desert Shield area",
  and
    (B)  such services are performed during the period beginning on August
  second, nineteen hundred ninety, and ending on the  date  on  which  any
  portion of the area referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is
  designated  by  the  president  as a combat zone pursuant to section one
  hundred twelve of the internal revenue code.
    (f) Relief for personnel under hostile fire. -- For purposes  of  this
  section,  members  of  the armed forces of the United States who perform
  military service in an area outside an area designated by the  president
  of  the  United  States  by  executive  order  as a "combat zone", which
  service is in direct support of military operations in such zone and  is
  performed  under  conditions which qualify such members for hostile fire
  pay, as authorized under subdivision (a) of section nine of the  federal
  uniformed  services  pay  act  of  nineteen  hundred sixty-three, shall,
  during the period of such qualifying service, be deemed to  have  served
  in such combat zone.
    (g)  Application  to spouse.-- The provisions of subsections (a), (b),
  (c), (e) and (f) of this section  shall  apply  to  the  spouse  of  any
  individual  entitled  to the benefits of subsection (a) of this section;
  provided, however, that such subsections shall not apply for any  spouse
  for  any  taxable  year  beginning  more  than  two years after the date
  designated under section one hundred twelve of the internal revenue code
  as the date of termination of combatant activities in a combat zone.
    (h)  Individuals  dying  as  a   result   of   certain   attacks   and
  astronauts.--(1) General. In the case of a specified terrorist victim or
  astronaut, any tax imposed by this article shall not apply--
    (A) with respect to the taxable year in which falls the date of death;
  and


   (B)  with  respect  to  any prior taxable year in the period beginning
  with the last taxable year ending before the taxable year in  which  the
  wounds  or injury referred to in paragraph three of this subsection were
  incurred.
    (2)  Taxation  of  certain  benefits. Paragraph one of this subsection
  shall not apply to the amount of any tax imposed by this  article  which

  individual.

  eighty   days   thereafter,  subsection  (a)  shall  not  apply  to  the
  collection, by the tax commission, by levy or otherwise of the amount of

  article.




   §  697.  General  powers  of  tax  commission.--(a)  General.--The tax
  commission shall administer and enforce the tax imposed by this  article
  and  it is authorized to make such rules and regulations, and to require
  such facts and information to be reported, as it may deem  necessary  to
  enforce  the  provisions  of this article. The tax commission may divide
  the state into districts in  each  of  which  a  branch  office  may  be
  maintained  by it, but in no case shall a county be divided in forming a
  district.
    (b) Examination of books and witnesses.--(1) The  tax  commission  for
  the  purpose  of  ascertaining the correctness of any return, or for the
  purpose of making an estimate of taxable income  of  any  person,  shall
  have  power  to  examine  or  to cause to have examined, by any agent or
  representative designated by it for that  purpose,  any  books,  papers,
  records or memoranda bearing upon the matters required to be included in
  the  return,  and may require the attendance of the person rendering the
  return or any officer or employee of such person, or the  attendance  of
  any  other  person  having  knowledge  in  the  premises,  and  may take
  testimony and require proof material for its information, with power  to
  administer oaths to such person or persons.
    (2) The tax commission may take any action under paragraph one of this
  subdivision  to inquire into the commission of an offense connected with
  the administration or enforcement of this  article,  provided,  however,
  that  notwithstanding the provisions of section one hundred seventy-four
  of this chapter no such action shall be taken when  a  referral  by  the
  department  or  the  tax  commission to the attorney general, a district
  attorney or any other  prosecutorial  agency  is  in  effect.  Provided,
  however,  the  tax  commission  shall have power, during the period when
  such referral is in effect, to examine or to cause to have examined,  by
  any  agent  or  representative  designated  by  it for that purpose, any
  books, papers, records or memoranda bearing upon the matters required to
  be included  in  the  return,  where  such  books,  papers,  records  or
  memoranda are in its possession, or where such books, papers, records or
  memoranda  are  in  the  possession  of  the  attorney general, district
  attorney or other prosecutorial agency to which such referral is made.
    (c) Abatement authority.--The tax commission, of its own  motion,  may
  abate  any  small  unpaid balance of an assessment of income tax, or any
  liability in respect thereof, if the  tax  commission  determines  under
  uniform  rules  prescribed  by it that the administration and collection
  costs involved would not warrant collection of the amount  due.  It  may
  also  abate,  of its own motion, the unpaid portion of the assessment of
  any tax or any liability in  respect  thereof,  which  is  excessive  in
  amount,  or is assessed after the expiration of the period of limitation
  properly applicable thereto, or is erroneously or illegally assessed. No
  claim for abatement under this subsection shall be filed by a taxpayer.
    (d) Special refund authority.--Where no questions of fact or  law  are
  involved  and it appears from the records of the tax commission that any
  moneys have been erroneously or illegally collected from any taxpayer or
  other person, or paid by such taxpayer or other person under  a  mistake
  of facts, pursuant to the provisions of this article, the tax commission
  at any time, without regard to any period of limitations, shall have the
  power, upon making a record of its reasons therefor in writing, to cause
  such  moneys  so  paid  and  being  erroneously and illegally held to be
  refunded and to issue therefor its certificate to the comptroller.
    (e) Secrecy requirement and penalties for  violation.--(1)  Except  in
  accordance  with  proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law,
  it shall be unlawful for the commissioner, any officer  or  employee  of
  the  department, any person engaged or retained by such department on an
  independent contract basis, any depositary to which any  return  may  be


 delivered  as  provided  in  subsection  (h) or (i) of this section, any
  officer or employee of such depositary, or any person who,  pursuant  to
  this  section, is permitted to inspect any report or return or to whom a
  copy,  an abstract or a portion of any report or return is furnished, or
  to whom any information contained in any report or return is  furnished,
  to  divulge  or  make  known  in  any manner the amount of income or any
  particulars set forth or disclosed in  any  report  or  return  required
  under  this  article, under section one hundred seventy-one-a or section
  one hundred seventy-one-h of this chapter, or  under  this  article  and
  article eighteen of the labor law.
    (2)  The officers charged with the custody of such reports and returns
  shall not be required to produce any of them  or  evidence  of  anything
  contained  in  them  in any action or proceeding in any court, except on
  behalf of  the  commissioner  in  an  action  or  proceeding  under  the
  provisions  of  this  chapter  or  in  any  other  action  or proceeding
  involving the collection of a tax due under this chapter  to  which  the
  state  or the commissioner is a party or a claimant, or on behalf of any
  party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this  article,
  or  under  the  provisions  of  this article and article eighteen of the
  labor law, when the reports, returns or facts shown thereby are directly
  involved in such action or proceeding, in any of which events the  court
  may  require  the  production  of, and may admit in evidence, so much of
  said reports, returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to
  the  action  or  proceeding  and  no   more.   The   commissioner   may,
  nevertheless, publish a copy or a summary of any decision rendered after
  the  hearing  required  under  section  six  hundred eighty-nine of this
  article.
    (3) Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the department,  its
  officers  or  employees  from  furnishing  information  to the office of
  temporary and disability assistance  relating  to  the  payment  of  the
  credit  for  certain household and dependent care services necessary for
  gainful employment under subsection (c) of section six  hundred  six  of
  this  article  and  the  earned  income  credit  under subsection (d) of
  section six hundred six of this article and the enhanced  earned  income
  credit  under  subsection  (d-1)  of  section  six  hundred  six of this
  article, or pursuant  to  a  local  law  enacted  by  a  city  having  a
  population  of one million or more pursuant to subsection (f) of section
  thirteen hundred ten of this chapter, only to the  extent  necessary  to
  calculate   qualified   state  expenditures  under  paragraph  seven  of
  subdivision (a) of section four  hundred  nine  of  the  federal  social
  security  act or to document the proper expenditure of federal temporary
  assistance for needy families funds under section four hundred three  of
  such  act.  The  office  of  temporary  and  disability  assistance  may
  redisclose such information to the United States  department  of  health
  and  human  services  only  to  the  extent  necessary to calculate such
  qualified state expenditures or to document the  proper  expenditure  of
  such  federal  temporary  assistance  for  needy families funds. Nothing
  herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery by  the  commissioner
  to  a commissioner of jurors, appointed pursuant to section five hundred
  four of the judiciary law,  or,  in  counties  within  cities  having  a
  population  of  one million or more, to the county clerk of such county,
  or to the clerk of the court or jury administrator of  a  United  States
  district  court  appointed  pursuant to title twenty-eight of the United
  States Code, section 1836(b)(2), of a mailing  list  of  individuals  to
  whom  income  tax  forms  are  mailed  by  the commissioner for the sole
  purpose of compiling a list of prospective jurors as provided in article
  sixteen of the judiciary law or title twenty-eight of the United  States
  Code. Provided, however, such delivery shall only be made pursuant to an


 order  of  the  chief administrator of the courts, appointed pursuant to
  section two hundred ten of the judiciary law or  an  order  of  a  chief
  judge  of  any  United  States district court in New York State. No such
  order  may  be  issued unless such chief administrator or chief judge of
  such United States district court is satisfied that such mailing list is
  needed to compile a proper list of prospective jurors for the county  or
  such  United  States  district  court for which such order is sought and

    (2)   For   school  aid  payable  in  school  years  nineteen  hundred

  from employers pursuant to article eighteen of the labor  law,  and  the
  department  shall  furnish  to  the  state department of labor, or other
  individuals designated by the commissioner of labor who are  engaged  in

  confidential, and shall not be disclosed or redisclosed except  for  tax
  administration  and  employment  security  and public assistance program
  purposes.
    (4)  The  commissioner  shall  enter  into  an  agreement   with   the
  commissioner  of  the  state  department of labor in order to ensure the
  confidentiality of tax and unemployment insurance information  and  that
  such information is disclosed only for authorized purposes in connection
  with  the  implementation of the provisions of this subsection and those

  subsection (a) of section six hundred seventy-four of this article.
    (m)  Disclosure  of  collection  activities  with  respect  to   joint
  return.--Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subsection  (e)  of  this
  section, if any deficiency of tax with respect  to  a  joint  return  is


 assessed and the individuals filing such return are no longer married or
  no  longer  reside  in  the  same  household, upon request in writing by
  either of such individuals, the commissioner shall disclose  in  writing
  to  the  individual  making  the  request  whether  the commissioner has
  attempted to collect such deficiency from  such  other  individual,  the
  general  nature of such collection activities, and the amount collected.
  The preceding sentence shall not apply to any deficiency which  may  not
  be collected by reason of the expiration of time within which to issue a

  court proceeding.
    (n)  Disclosure  of  certain information where more than one person is
  subject to penalty.--If the commissioner determines  that  a  person  is
  liable  for  a  penalty  under  subsection  (g)  of  section six hundred
  eighty-five of this article with respect to any failure, upon request in
  writing of such person, the commissioner shall disclose  in  writing  to
  such  person  (1) the name of any other person whom the commissioner has
  determined to be liable for such penalty with respect to  such  failure,
  and  (2)  whether the commissioner has attempted to collect such penalty
  from  such  other  person,  the  general  nature  of   such   collection
  activities, and the amount collected.
    (o)   Exchange  of  information  with  the  office  of  temporary  and
  disability assistance.--Notwithstanding any  provision  of  law  to  the
  contrary,  the  department  shall furnish to the office of temporary and
  disability assistance, or as  designated  by  the  commissioner  of  the
  office  of  children and family services, to employees of a local social

  who is in the custody, care and custody or custody and guardianship of a
  local social services district or of the office of children  and  family
  services  during  the  month  that  the court proceedings leading to the
  child's removal from  the  household  were  initiated,  or  the  written

   § 693. Transferees.--(a) General.--The liability, at law or in equity,
  of a transferee of property of a taxpayer for any tax, additions to tax,
  penalty  or interest due the tax commission under this article, shall be
  assessed, paid, and collected in the same manner and subject to the same
  provisions and limitations as in the  case  of  the  tax  to  which  the
  liability  relates, except that the period of limitations for assessment
  against the transferee shall be extended by one year for each successive
  transfer, in  order,  from  the  original  taxpayer  to  the  transferee
  involved,  but  not  by more than three years in the aggregate. The term
  transferee includes donee, heir, legatee, devisee and distributee.
    (b) Exceptions.--
    (1) If  before  the  expiration  of  the  period  of  limitations  for
  assessment of liability of the transferee, a claim has been filed by the
  tax  commission  in  any court against the original taxpayer or the last
  preceding transferee based upon the liability of the original  taxpayer,
  then  the  period  of  limitation  for  assessment  of  liability of the
  transferee shall in no event expire prior to one year after  such  claim
  has been finally allowed, disallowed or otherwise disposed of.
    (2) If, before the expiration of the time prescribed in subsection (a)
  or  the  immediately  preceding  paragraph  of  this  subsection for the
  assessment of the liability, the tax commission and the transferee  have
  both  consented  in  writing  to  its  assessment  after  such time, the
  liability may be assessed at any time prior to  the  expiration  of  the
  period  agreed  upon.  The  period  so  agreed  upon  may be extended by
  subsequent agreements in writing  made  before  the  expiration  of  the
  period previously agreed upon. For the purpose of determining the period
  of  limitation  on credit or refund to the transferee of overpayments of
  tax made  by  such  transferee  or  overpayments  of  tax  made  by  the
  transferor  as  to which the transferee is legally entitled to credit or
  refund, such agreement and any extension  thereof  shall  be  deemed  an
  agreement and extension thereof referred to in subsection (b) of section
  six  hundred  eighty-seven.  If  the  agreement  is  executed  after the
  expiration of the  period  of  limitation  for  assessment  against  the
  original taxpayer, then in applying the limitations under subsection (b)
  of  section  six  hundred  eighty-seven  on  the amount of the credit or
  refund, the periods specified in subsection (a) of section  six  hundred
  eighty-seven  shall  be  increased  by  the period from the date of such
  expiration to the date of the agreement.
    (c) Deceased transferor.--If any person is  deceased,  the  period  of
  limitation  for assessment against him shall be the period that would be
  in effect if he had lived.
    (d) Evidence.--Notwithstanding the provisions  of  subsection  (e)  of
  section six hundred ninety-seven the tax commission shall use its powers
  to  make  available  to  the transferee evidence necessary to enable the
  transferee to determine the liability of the original  taxpayer  and  of
  any  preceding  transferees,  but without undue hardship to the original
  taxpayer or preceding transferee. See  subsection  (e)  of  section  six
  hundred eighty-nine for rule as to burden of proof.
    (e)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph one of subsection (e)
  of section six hundred ninety-seven of this part, the  commissioner  may
  furnish  information  relating  to  real  property transfers obtained or
  derived from returns filed pursuant to this article in relation  to  the
  real  estate  transfer  tax, to the extent that such information is also
  required to be reported to the commissioner  by  section  three  hundred
  thirty-three   of  the  real  property  law  and  section  five  hundred
  seventy-four of  the  real  property  tax  law  and  the  rules  adopted
  thereunder,  provided  such information was collected through a combined
  process established pursuant to  an  agreement  entered  into  with  the


 commissioner  pursuant to paragraph viii of subdivision one-e of section
  three hundred thirty-three of the real property  law.  The  commissioner
  may redisclose such information to the extent authorized by section five
  hundred seventy-four of the real property tax law.




   §  694.  Jeopardy  assessment.--(a). Authority for making.--If the tax
  commission believes that the assessment or collection  of  a  deficiency
  will  be  jeopardized by delay, it shall, notwithstanding the provisions
  of  section  six  hundred  eighty-one  and   six   hundred   ninety-six,
  immediately   assess   such  deficiency  (together  with  all  interest,
  penalties and additions to tax provided for  by  law),  and  notice  and
  demand shall be made by the tax commission for the payment thereof.
    (b)  Notice  of deficiency.--If the jeopardy assessment is made before
  any notice in respect of  the  tax  to  which  the  jeopardy  assessment
  relates  has  been mailed under section six hundred eighty-one, then the
  tax commission shall mail a notice under such section within sixty  days
  after the making of the assessment.
    (c) Amount assessable before decision of tax commission.--The jeopardy
  assessment  may  be made in respect of a deficiency greater or less than
  that of which notice is mailed to the taxpayer and whether  or  not  the
  taxpayer  has  theretofore filed a petition with the tax commission. The
  tax commission may, at any time before  rendering  its  decision,  abate
  such  assessment,  or  any unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that it
  believes the assessment to be excessive in amount.   The tax  commission
  may  in its decision redetermine the entire amount of the deficiency and
  of all amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith.
    (d) Amount  assessable  after  decision  of  tax  commission.--If  the
  jeopardy  assessment is made after the decision of the tax commission is
  rendered, such assessment may be made only in respect of the  deficiency
  determined by the tax commission in its decision.
    (e)  Expiration  of right to assess.--A jeopardy assessment may not be
  made after the decision of the tax commission has become final or  after
  the  taxpayer  has made an application for review of the decision of the
  tax commission.
    (f) Collection of unpaid amounts.--When a petition has been filed with
  the tax commission and when the amount which should have  been  assessed
  has been determined by a decision of the tax commission which has become
  final,  then any unpaid portion, the collection of which has been stayed
  by bond, shall be collected as part of the tax upon  notice  and  demand
  from  the  tax  commission,  and any remaining portion of the assessment
  shall be abated. If the amount  already  collected  exceeds  the  amount
  determined  as  the  amount which should have been assessed, such excess
  shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer as provided in section six
  hundred eighty-six without the filing of claim therefor.  If the  amount
  determined as the amount which should have been assessed is greater than
  the  amount actually assessed, then the difference shall be assessed and
  shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and  demand  from  the
  tax commission.
    (g)  Abatement  if  jeopardy  does  not exist.--The tax commission may
  abate the jeopardy assessment if it finds that jeopardy does not  exist.
  Such abatement may not be made after a decision of the tax commission in
  respect  of the deficiency has been rendered or, if no petition is filed
  with the tax commission, after the expiration of the period  for  filing
  such petition. The period of limitation on the making of assessments and
  levy or a proceeding for collection, in respect of any deficiency, shall
  be determined as if the jeopardy assessment so abated had not been made,
  except  that  the running of such period shall in any event be suspended
  for the period from the date  of  such  jeopardy  assessment  until  the
  expiration  of  the  tenth  day  after  the  day  on which such jeopardy
  assessment is abated.
    (h) Bond to stay collection.--The  collection  of  the  whole  or  any
  amount  of  any jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing with the tax
  commission, within such time as may be fixed by regulation, a bond in an


 amount equal to the amount as to which the stay is desired,  conditioned
  upon  the  payment  of  the  amount (together with interest thereon) the
  collection of which is stayed at the time at which, but for  the  making
  of  the  jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due.  Upon the filing
  of the bond the collection of so much  of  the  amount  assessed  as  is
  covered  by  the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the right
  to waive such stay at any time in respect of the whole or  any  part  of
  the  amount  covered  by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any
  part of the amount covered by the bond is paid, then the bond  shall  at
  the  request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. If any portion
  of the jeopardy assessment is abated, or if a notice of deficiency under
  section six hundred eighty-one is mailed to the  taxpayer  in  a  lesser
  amount,   the   bond   shall,   at  the  request  of  the  taxpayer,  be
  proportionately reduced.
    (i) Petition to tax commission.--If  the  bond  is  given  before  the
  taxpayer  has  filed his petition under section six hundred eighty-nine,
  the bond shall contain a further condition that if  a  petition  is  not
  filed  within  the period provided in such section, then the amount, the
  collection of which is stayed by the bond, will be paid  on  notice  and
  demand  at  any  time after the expiration of such period, together with
  interest thereon from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to  the
  date  of  notice  and  demand  under  this subsection. The bond shall be
  conditioned upon the payment of so much of such  assessment  (collection
  of  which  is  stayed by the bond) as is not abated by a decision of the
  tax commission which has become final. If the tax commission  determines
  that  the  amount  assessed is greater than the amount which should have
  been assessed, then the bond shall, at the request of the  taxpayer,  be
  proportionately  reduced  when  the  decision  of  the tax commission is
  rendered.
    (j)  Stay  of  sale  of  seized  property   pending   tax   commission
  decision.--Where  a jeopardy assessment is made, the property seized for
  the collection of the tax shall not be sold--
    (1) if subsection (b) is applicable, prior  to  the  issuance  of  the
  notice  of deficiency and the expiration of the time provided in section
  six hundred eighty-nine for filing a petition with the  tax  commission,
  and
    (2)  if a petition is filed with the tax commission (whether before or
  after the making of such jeopardy assessment), prior to  the  expiration
  of  the  period  during  which the assessment of the deficiency would be
  prohibited if subsection (a) were not applicable.
  Such property may be sold if the taxpayer consents to the  sale,  or  if
  the  tax  commission  determines  that  the expenses of conservation and
  maintenance will greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property  is
  perishable.
    (k)  Interest.--For  the  purpose  of  subsection  (a)  of section six
  hundred eighty-four, the last  date  prescribed  for  payment  shall  be
  determined  without  regard  to any notice and demand for payment issued
  under this section prior to the last date otherwise prescribed for  such
  payment.
    (l)  Early  termination  of taxable year.--If the tax commission finds
  that a taxpayer designs quickly to depart from this state or  to  remove
  his  property  therefrom, or to conceal himself or his property therein,
  or to do any other act tending to  prejudice  or  to  render  wholly  or
  partly ineffectual proceedings to collect the income tax for the current
  or the preceding taxable year unless such proceedings be brought without
  delay,  the  tax  commission  shall  declare the taxable period for such
  taxpayer immediately terminated, and shall cause notice of such  finding
  and  declaration  to  be  given the taxpayer, together with a demand for


 immediate payment  of  the  tax  for  the  taxable  period  so  declared
  terminated  and  of the tax for the preceding taxable year or so much of
  such tax as is unpaid, whether or not the time otherwise allowed by  law
  for  filing  return and paying the tax has expired; and such taxes shall
  thereupon become immediately due and payable. In any proceeding  brought
  to  enforce  payment  of  taxes  made  due  and payable by virtue of the
  provisions of this subsection, the finding of the tax commission made as
  herein provided, whether made after notice to the taxpayer or not, shall
  be for all purposes presumptive evidence of jeopardy.
    (m) Reopening of taxable period.--Notwithstanding the  termination  of
  the taxable period of the taxpayer by the tax commission, as provided in
  subsection  (l),  the tax commission may reopen such taxable period each
  time the taxpayer is found  by  the  tax  commission  to  have  received
  income,  within  the current taxable year, since the termination of such
  period. A taxable period so terminated by  the  tax  commission  may  be
  reopened  by the taxpayer if he files with the tax commission a true and
  accurate return of taxable income and credits allowed under this article
  for such taxable period, together with such other information as the tax
  commission may by regulations prescribe.
    (n) Furnishing of bond  where  taxable  year  is  closed  by  the  tax
  commission.--Payment  of  taxes shall not be enforced by any proceedings
  under the provisions of subsection (l) prior to the  expiration  of  the
  time  otherwise allowed for paying such taxes if the taxpayer furnishes,
  under regulations prescribed by the tax commission, a bond to insure the
  timely making of returns with respect to, and payment of, such taxes  or
  any income taxes for prior years.




   §  695.  Criminal penalties; cross-reference.--For criminal penalties,

   §  696.  Income  taxes  of  members  of  armed forces, astronauts, and
  victims of certain terrorist attacks.--(a) Time to  be  disregarded.--In
  the  case  of  an  individual  serving in the armed forces of the United
  States, or  serving  in  support  of  such  armed  forces,  in  an  area
  designated by the president of the United States by executive order as a
  "combat  zone" at any time during the period designated by the president
  by executive order as the period of combatant activities in  such  zone,
  or  when  deployed  outside the United States away from the individual's
  permanent duty station while  participating  in  an  operation  that  is
  either  designated  by  the  United  States  secretary  of  defense as a
  "contingency operation" or which became a contingency operation  due  to

§  697.  General  powers  of  tax  commission.--(a)  General.--The tax

  and  it is authorized to make such rules and regulations, and to require
  such facts and information to be reported, as it may deem  necessary  to
  enforce  the  provisions  of this article. The tax commission may divide
  the state into districts in  each  of  which  a  branch  office  may  be
  maintained  by it, but in no case shall a county be divided in forming a
  district.
    (b) Examination of books and witnesses.--(1) The  tax  commission  for
  the  purpose  of  ascertaining the correctness of any return, or for the
  purpose of making an estimate of taxable income  of  any  person,  shall
  have  power  to  examine  or  to cause to have examined, by any agent or
  representative designated by it for that  purpose,  any  books,  papers,
  records or memoranda bearing upon the matters required to be included in
  the  return,  and may require the attendance of the person rendering the
  return or any officer or employee of such person, or the  attendance  of
  any  other  person  having  knowledge  in  the  premises,  and  may take
  testimony and require proof material for its information, with power  to
  administer oaths to such person or persons.
    (2) The tax commission may take any action under paragraph one of this
  subdivision  to inquire into the commission of an offense connected with
  the administration or enforcement of this  article,  provided,  however,
  that  notwithstanding the provisions of section one hundred seventy-four
  of this chapter no such action shall be taken when  a  referral  by  the
  department  or  the  tax  commission to the attorney general, a district
  attorney or any other  prosecutorial  agency  is  in  effect.  Provided,
  however,  the  tax  commission  shall have power, during the period when
  such referral is in effect, to examine or to cause to have examined,  by
  any  agent  or  representative  designated  by  it for that purpose, any
  books, papers, records or memoranda bearing upon the matters required to
  be included  in  the  return,  where  such  books,  papers,  records  or
  memoranda are in its possession, or where such books, papers, records or
  memoranda  are  in  the  possession  of  the  attorney general, district
  attorney or other prosecutorial agency to which such referral is made.
    (c) Abatement authority.--The tax commission, of its own  motion,  may
  abate  any  small  unpaid balance of an assessment of income tax, or any
  liability in respect thereof, if the  tax  commission  determines  under
  uniform  rules  prescribed  by it that the administration and collection
  costs involved would not warrant collection of the amount  due.  It  may
  also  abate,  of its own motion, the unpaid portion of the assessment of
  any tax or any liability in  respect  thereof,  which  is  excessive  in
  amount,  or is assessed after the expiration of the period of limitation
  properly applicable thereto, or is erroneously or illegally assessed. No
  claim for abatement under this subsection shall be filed by a taxpayer.
    (d) Special refund authority.--Where no questions of fact or  law  are
  involved  and it appears from the records of the tax commission that any
  moneys have been erroneously or illegally collected from any taxpayer or
  other person, or paid by such taxpayer or other person under  a  mistake
  of facts, pursuant to the provisions of this article, the tax commission
  at any time, without regard to any period of limitations, shall have the
  power, upon making a record of its reasons therefor in writing, to cause
  such  moneys  so  paid  and  being  erroneously and illegally held to be
  refunded and to issue therefor its certificate to the comptroller.
    (e) Secrecy requirement and penalties for  violation.--(1)  Except  in
  accordance  with  proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law,
  it shall be unlawful for the commissioner, any officer  or  employee  of
  the  department, any person engaged or retained by such department on an
  independent contract basis, any depositary to which any  return  may  be


 delivered  as  provided  in  subsection  (h) or (i) of this section, any
  officer or employee of such depositary, or any person who,  pursuant  to
  this  section, is permitted to inspect any report or return or to whom a
  copy,  an abstract or a portion of any report or return is furnished, or
  to whom any information contained in any report or return is  furnished,
  to  divulge  or  make  known  in  any manner the amount of income or any
  particulars set forth or disclosed in  any  report  or  return  required
  under  this  article, under section one hundred seventy-one-a or section
  one hundred seventy-one-h of this chapter, or  under  this  article  and
  article eighteen of the labor law.
    (2)  The officers charged with the custody of such reports and returns
  shall not be required to produce any of them  or  evidence  of  anything
  contained  in  them  in any action or proceeding in any court, except on
  behalf of  the  commissioner  in  an  action  or  proceeding  under  the
  provisions  of  this  chapter  or  in  any  other  action  or proceeding
  involving the collection of a tax due under this chapter  to  which  the
  state  or the commissioner is a party or a claimant, or on behalf of any
  party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this  article,
  or  under  the  provisions  of  this article and article eighteen of the
  labor law, when the reports, returns or facts shown thereby are directly
  involved in such action or proceeding, in any of which events the  court
  may  require  the  production  of, and may admit in evidence, so much of
  said reports, returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to
  the  action  or  proceeding  and  no   more.   The   commissioner   may,
  nevertheless, publish a copy or a summary of any decision rendered after
  the  hearing  required  under  section  six  hundred eighty-nine of this
  article.
    (3) Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the department,  its
  officers  or  employees  from  furnishing  information  to the office of
  temporary and disability assistance  relating  to  the  payment  of  the
  credit  for  certain household and dependent care services necessary for
  gainful employment under subsection (c) of section six  hundred  six  of
  this  article  and  the  earned  income  credit  under subsection (d) of
  section six hundred six of this article and the enhanced  earned  income
  credit  under  subsection  (d-1)  of  section  six  hundred  six of this
  article, or pursuant  to  a  local  law  enacted  by  a  city  having  a
  population  of one million or more pursuant to subsection (f) of section
  thirteen hundred ten of this chapter, only to the  extent  necessary  to
  calculate   qualified   state  expenditures  under  paragraph  seven  of
  subdivision (a) of section four  hundred  nine  of  the  federal  social
  security  act or to document the proper expenditure of federal temporary
  assistance for needy families funds under section four hundred three  of
  such  act.  The  office  of  temporary  and  disability  assistance  may
  redisclose such information to the United States  department  of  health
  and  human  services  only  to  the  extent  necessary to calculate such
  qualified state expenditures or to document the  proper  expenditure  of
  such  federal  temporary  assistance  for  needy families funds. Nothing
  herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery by  the  commissioner
  to  a commissioner of jurors, appointed pursuant to section five hundred
  four of the judiciary law,  or,  in  counties  within  cities  having  a
  population  of  one million or more, to the county clerk of such county,
  or to the clerk of the court or jury administrator of  a  United  States
  district  court  appointed  pursuant to title twenty-eight of the United
  States Code, section 1836(b)(2), of a mailing  list  of  individuals  to
  whom  income  tax  forms  are  mailed  by  the commissioner for the sole
  purpose of compiling a list of prospective jurors as provided in article
  sixteen of the judiciary law or title twenty-eight of the United  States
  Code. Provided, however, such delivery shall only be made pursuant to an


 order  of  the  chief administrator of the courts, appointed pursuant to
  section two hundred ten of the judiciary law or  an  order  of  a  chief
  judge  of  any  United  States district court in New York State. No such
  order  may  be  issued unless such chief administrator or chief judge of
  such United States district court is satisfied that such mailing list is
  needed to compile a proper list of prospective jurors for the county  or
  such  United  States  district  court for which such order is sought and
  that, in view of the responsibilities imposed by the various laws of the
  state on the department, it is reasonable to require the commissioner to
  furnish such list. Such order shall provide that such list shall be used
  for the sole purpose of compiling a list of prospective jurors and  that
  such commissioner of jurors, or such county clerk, or clerk of the court
  or  jury  administrator  of such United States district court shall take
  all necessary steps to insure that the list  is  kept  confidential  and
  that   there  is  no  unauthorized  use  or  disclosure  of  such  list.
  Furthermore, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the  delivery
  to  a  taxpayer  or  his  or  her  duly  authorized  representative of a
  certified copy of any return or report filed in connection with  his  or
  her tax or to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to
  prevent  the  identification  of  particular  reports or returns and the
  items thereof, or the inspection by the attorney general or other  legal
  representatives  of the state of the report or return of any taxpayer or
  of any employer filed under section one hundred  seventy-one-h  of  this
  chapter, where such taxpayer or employer shall bring action to set aside
  or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action or proceeding
  under  this  chapter  or  under this chapter and article eighteen of the
  labor law has been recommended by the commissioner, the commissioner  of
  labor  with  respect  to unemployment insurance matters, or the attorney
  general or has been instituted, or the  inspection  of  the  reports  or
  returns   required  under  this  article  by  the  comptroller  or  duly
  designated officer or employee of the  state  department  of  audit  and
  control,  for  purposes  of  the  audit of a refund of any tax paid by a
  taxpayer under this article, or the furnishing to the  state  department
  of  labor of unemployment insurance information obtained or derived from
  quarterly  combined  withholding,  wage   reporting   and   unemployment

  paragraph four of subsection (a) of section six hundred seventy-four  of
  this  article,  for  purposes  of  administration  of  such department's
  unemployment insurance program, employment services program, federal and
  state employment and training programs, employment statistics and  labor

  houses  or  trust companies designated by the tax commission and to file
  reports and returns which such banks, banking houses or trust  companies

  such  banks,  banking  houses  or  trust  companies  as  are or shall be
  designated by the comptroller as depositories pursuant  to  section  six
  hundred ninety-eight.
    (j)  Authority  to set interest rates.--(1) The commissioner shall set

  rates set by the commissioner shall  apply  to  taxes,  or  any  portion


 thereof,  which remain or become due or overpaid on or after the date on

  twelve hundred seventy-four of the internal  revenue  code  for  use  in
  connection  with  section  six  thousand  six  hundred twenty-one of the
  internal revenue code. Any such rate shall be  rounded  to  the  nearest

  shall be increased to the next highest full percent).
    (B) Period during which rate applies.
    (i) In general. Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii)  of  this
  subparagraph,  the  federal  short-term rate for the first month in each

  short-term  rate  which  applies  during  the  third month following the
  taxable year shall also apply during  the  first  fifteen  days  of  the
  fourth month following such taxable year.
    (iii)  Special  rule  for  the  month  of  September, nineteen hundred
  eighty-nine. The  federal  short-term  rate  for  the  month  of  April,

  rate  of  interest  for  the  month  of  September,   nineteen   hundred
  eighty-nine.

  respect to income taxes required to be withheld and  paid  over  by  him
  pursuant to the provisions of part five of this article and with respect
  to interest payable to an employer pursuant to subsection (c) of section
  six hundred eighty-six, the rates of interest prescribed by this section
  shall  be  the overpayment and underpayment rates of interest prescribed
  in paragraph two of subsection (e) of section one thousand ninety-six of
  this chapter.
    (5) In computing the amount of any interest required to be paid  under
  this  article  by  the  commissioner  of  taxation and finance or by the
  taxpayer, or any other amount determined by reference to such amount  of
  interest,  such  interest and such amount shall be compounded daily. The
  preceding sentence shall not apply for purposes of computing the  amount
  of any addition to tax for failure to pay estimated tax under subsection
  (c) of section six hundred eighty-five.
    (6)  Publication  of  interest rates. The commissioner of taxation and
  finance shall publish the interest rates set under  this  subsection  on
  the  website  of  the  department  of  taxation and finance. Immediately
  following such publication, the commissioner shall cause  such  interest
  rates  to  be  published in the section for miscellaneous notices in the


 state register  and  give  other  appropriate  general  notice  of  such
  interest rates. The setting and publication of such interest rates shall

  (.60) percent of the net earnings from  self-employment  of  individuals

  however, that employers subject to section nine of  this  chapter  other
  than school districts as defined in section thirty-six hundred nine-g of
  the  education  law  must pay the tax on the payroll expense at the same
  time as the  withholding  tax  remitted  under  the  electronic  payment

  subsection.






	   §  805.  Deposit  and disposition of revenue. (a) The taxes, interest,
  and penalties imposed by this article and collected or received  by  the
  commissioner  shall  be  deposited  daily  with  such responsible banks,
  banking  houses  or  trust  companies,  as  may  be  designated  by  the
  comptroller,  to  the  credit  of  the  comptroller  in  trust  for  the

  Of  the  total  revenue  collected  or  received under this article, the
  comptroller shall retain such amount as the commissioner  may  determine

  by this article.
    (b)  On  or before the twelfth and twenty-sixth day of each succeeding
  month, after reserving such amount for such refunds and  deducting  such
  amounts  for  such  costs,  as  provided  for  in subsection (a) of this
  section, the commissioner shall certify to the comptroller the amount of
  all revenues so received during the prior  month  as  a  result  of  the
  taxes,  interest  and  penalties  so  imposed. The amount of revenues so
  certified shall be paid over by the fifteenth and the final business day
  of each succeeding month from such account  without  appropriation  into
  the  metropolitan  transportation  authority  finance  fund  established
  pursuant to section twelve hundred seventy-h of the  public  authorities
  law,  provided,  however,  that  the  comptroller  shall ensure that any
  payments to the metropolitan transportation authority finance fund which
  are due to be paid by the final business day in the  month  of  December
  pursuant  to  this  subsection  shall  be  received  by the metropolitan
  transportation authority finance fund on the same business day in  which
  it is paid.






	   §  806.  Procedural provisions. (a) General. All provisions of article
  twenty-two of this chapter will apply to the provisions of this  article

  referred to the tax imposed by this article, except to the  extent  that
  any provision is either inconsistent with a provision of this article or

    (2)  Where  a  combined  return  is  required, and with respect to the
  payment of estimated tax, the commissioner may also require the  payment

  (total taxes less any credits or refunds) which would have been required
  to be paid with the returns or in payment of estimated tax  pursuant  to
  the  provisions of this article, the provisions of article twenty-two of
  this chapter, and  the  provisions  of  local  laws  enacted  under  the

  or under a local law  enacted  pursuant  to  the  authority  of  article
  thirty,  article  thirty-A,  or  article  thirty-B  of this chapter, and

  the enforcement and collection of the tax or taxes assessed  under  such
  articles,  the  commissioner  shall,  whenever  possible  and necessary,
  accompany such action with a similar action  under  similar  enforcement
  and collection provisions of the tax imposed by this article.
    (c)  Apportionment  of  moneys  collected  by joint action. Any moneys
  collected as a result of such joint action shall be deemed to have  been
  collected  in  proportion  to the amounts due, including tax, penalties,
  interest and additions to tax, under article twenty-two of this  chapter
  or  under  a  local  law  enacted  pursuant  to the authority of article
  thirty, thirty-A, or thirty-B of this chapter and  the  tax  imposed  by
  this article.
    (d)  Joint  deficiency  action.  Whenever  the  commissioner takes any

  twenty-two  of this chapter or under a local law enacted pursuant to the
  authority of article thirty, thirty-A,  or  thirty-B  of  this  chapter,
  other  than  the action set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the

  amount  shall  be  allowed  against  the  tax imposed by this section as
  provided in this subsection. In the case of a decedent  whose  New  York
  taxable  estate is less than or equal to the basic exclusion amount, the
  applicable credit amount shall be the amount of tax that  would  be  due
  under subsection (b) of this section on such decedent's New York taxable
  estate.  In the case of a decedent whose New York taxable estate exceeds
  the basic exclusion amount by an amount that is less than  or  equal  to
  five  percent  of such amount, the applicable credit amount shall be the
  amount of tax that would be due under subsection (b) of this section  if
  the  amount  on  which the tax is to be computed were equal to the basic
  exclusion amount multiplied by one minus a fraction,  the  numerator  of
  which  is  the  decedent's  New  York  taxable  estate  minus  the basic
  exclusion amount, and the denominator of which is five  percent  of  the
  basic  exclusion  amount.  Provided, however, that the credit allowed by
  this subsection shall not exceed the tax imposed by this section, and no
  credit shall be allowed to the estate of any  decedent  whose  New  York
  taxable  estate  exceeds one hundred five percent of the basic exclusion
  amount.
    (2) (A) For purposes of this section, the basic exclusion amount shall
  be as follows:
  In the case of decedents dying on or after: The basic  exclusion  amount
  is:


 April 1, 2014 and before April 1, 2015       $ 2,062,500
  April 1, 2015 and before April 1, 2016       3,125,000
  April 1, 2016 and before April 1, 2017       4,187,500
  April 1, 2017 and before January 1, 2019     5,250,000
    (B)  In the case of any decedent dying in a calendar year beginning on
  or after January first,  two  thousand  nineteen,  the  basic  exclusion
  amount shall be equal to:
    (i) five million dollars, multiplied by
    (ii)  one  plus  the  cost-of-living  adjustment,  which  shall be the
  percentage by which the consumer price index for the preceding  calendar
  year  exceeds  the  consumer  price index for calendar year two thousand
  ten.
    (C) (i) For purposes of this paragraph, "consumer price  index"  means
  the  most  recent consumer price index for all-urban consumers published
  by the United States department of labor.
    (ii)  For  purposes  of  clause  (ii)  of  subparagraph  (B)  of  this
  paragraph,  the  consumer price index for any calendar year shall be the
  average of the consumer price index as of the close of the  twelve-month
  period ending on August thirty-first of such calendar year.
    (iii) If any amount adjusted under this paragraph is not a multiple of
  ten  thousand  dollars,  such  amount  shall  be  rounded to the nearest
  multiple of ten thousand dollars.




   §  954.  Resident's New York gross estate. (a) General.-- The New York
  gross estate of a deceased resident  means  his  or  her  federal  gross
  estate as defined in the internal revenue code (whether or not a federal
  estate tax return is required to be filed) modified as follows:
    (1)  Reduced by the value of real or tangible personal property having
  an actual situs outside New York state.
    (2) Increased by the amount  determined  under  section  nine  hundred
  fifty-seven  of  this  part  (relating  to limited powers of appointment
  created prior to September first, nineteen hundred thirty).
    (3) Increased by the amount of any taxable gift under section 2503  of
  the  internal  revenue  code  not  otherwise  included in the decedent's
  federal gross estate, made during the three year period  ending  on  the
  decedent's  date of death, but not including any gift made: (A) when the
  decedent was not a resident of New  York  state;  or  (B)  before  April
  first, two thousand fourteen; or (C) between January first, two thousand
  nineteen  and  January  fifteenth, two thousand nineteen; or (D) that is
  real or tangible personal property having an actual  situs  outside  New
  York  state  at  the time the gift was made. Provided, however that this
  paragraph shall not apply to the estate of a decedent dying on or  after
  January first, two thousand twenty-six.
    (4)  Increased  by  the  value  of  any property not otherwise already
  included in the decedent's federal gross estate in  which  the  decedent
  had  a qualifying income interest for life if a deduction was allowed on
  the return of the tax imposed  by  this  article  with  respect  to  the
  transfer  of  such property to the decedent by reason of the application
  of paragraph (7) of subsection (b)  of  section  2056  of  the  internal
  revenue  code,  as made applicable to the tax imposed by this article by
  section nine hundred ninety-nine-a of this article,  whether  or  not  a
  federal  estate tax return was required to be filed by the estate of the
  transferring spouse.
    (b) Valuation. -- (1) The New York gross estate shall be valued as  of
  the  time  of  the decedent's death, except that if a federal estate tax
  return is filed and the alternate valuation under section  2032  of  the
  internal  revenue  code  is elected for federal estate tax purposes, the
  New York gross estate shall be  valued  as  of  the  applicable  federal
  valuation  date  or dates. Any real property qualified under section two
  thousand thirty-two-A of the internal revenue code shall have  the  same
  value  for  purposes  of the New York gross estate as it has for federal
  estate tax purposes.
    (2) If such alternate valuation could have been  elected  pursuant  to
  paragraph  one  of  this  subsection,  but  for the absence of an estate
  sufficient to require the filing of a federal return, the New York gross
  estate may, upon the election of the  executor,  be  valued  as  of  the
  federal  valuation  date  or dates which would have applied if a federal
  return had been filed. However, no  election  may  be  made  under  this
  paragraph  unless  such election will decrease the value of the New York
  gross estate and the amount of tax imposed by this article  (reduced  by
  credits  allowable  against  such  tax).  Any  election  made under this
  paragraph shall be irrevocable. The election allowed by  this  paragraph
  shall  be  made  no later than the date prescribed for the filing of the
  return under this article (including extensions) or any time  thereafter
  as the commissioner may prescribe.

   §  955.  Resident's New York taxable estate. (a) General.--The taxable
  estate of a New York resident shall be his or her New York gross estate,
  minus the deductions  allowable  for  determining  his  or  her  federal
  taxable estate under the internal revenue code (whether or not a federal
  estate  tax  return  is required to be filed), except to the extent that
  such deductions relate to real or  tangible  personal  property  sitused
  outside New York state.
    (b)  Waiver  of  deductions.-- If the right to any deduction otherwise
  allowable is waived  for  federal  estate  tax  purposes,  it  shall  be
  considered waived for New York estate tax purposes.
    (c)  Qualified  terminable  interest  property  election.--  Except as
  otherwise provided in this  subsection,  the  election  referred  to  in
  paragraph  (7) of subsection (b) of section 2056 of the internal revenue
  code shall not be allowed under this article unless  such  election  was
  made  with respect to the federal estate tax return required to be filed
  under the provisions of the internal revenue code. If such election  was
  made for the purposes of the federal estate tax, then such election must
  also  be  made  by the executor on the return of the tax imposed by this
  article. Where no federal estate tax return is required to be filed, the
  executor must make the election referred to in such paragraph  (7)  with
  respect  to  the  tax  imposed  by this article on the return of the tax
  imposed by this article. Any election made under this  subsection  shall
  be irrevocable.
    (d)  Cross  references.--  For provisions of the internal revenue code
  specifying the deductions allowable for  federal  estate  tax  purposes,

   § 957. Modification for limited powers of appointment created prior to
  September  first,  nineteen hundred thirty. (a) General.--In determining
  the New York gross estate, there shall be added  to  the  federal  gross
  estate of a deceased resident the value of all property (other than real
  and  tangible personal property situated outside New York state) passing
  under a limited power of appointment exercised by the  decedent  (A)  by
  will  or  (B) by a disposition which is of such nature that if it were a
  transfer of property owned by him, such property would be includible  in
  his  federal  gross  estate  under section two thousand thirty-five, two
  thousand  thirty-six,  two  thousand  thirty-seven   or   two   thousand
  thirty-eight of the internal revenue code.
    (b)  Definition.--  For  purposes  of this section, a limited power of
  appointment means a power--
    (1) with respect to property which is not or was not  subject  to  New
  York  death  tax  in  the estate of the grantor of such power, but would
  have been so taxable except for a statute providing that the tax on  the
  transfer of such property should be imposed in the estate of the grantee
  of such power in the event of its exercise; and
    (2)  the  exercise  of  which  has  not  required the inclusion of the
  property in the  decedent's  federal  gross  estate  under  section  two
  thousand  forty-one  of  the  internal revenue code (relating to general
  powers of appointment).




   §  958. Exemptions in other laws not applicable. No exemption provided
  for in any other article of this chapter or any other law of this  state
  shall be construed as being applicable in any manner under this article.




   § 960. Nonresident's estate tax. (a) General.--A tax is hereby imposed
  on the transfer, from any deceased individual who at his death was not a
  resident  of  New  York  state,  of  real and tangible personal property
  having an actual situs in New York state and either  (i)  includible  in
  his  federal  gross  estate or (ii) which would be includible in his New
  York gross estate pursuant to section nine hundred fifty-seven (relating
  to certain limited powers of appointment) if he were a resident  of  New
  York state.
    (b) Computation of tax.--The tax imposed under subsection (a) shall be
  the  same  as  the  tax  that  would  be due, if the decedent had died a
  resident, under subsection (a) of section nine hundred fifty-two, except
  that for purposes of computing the tax under subsection (b)  of  section
  nine  hundred fifty-two, "New York taxable estate" shall not include the
  value of, or any deduction allowable under  the  Internal  Revenue  Code
  related to, any intangible personal property otherwise includible in the
  deceased  individual's  New York gross estate, and shall not include the
  amount of any gift  unless  such  gift  consists  of  real  or  tangible
  personal property having an actual situs in New York state or intangible
  personal property employed in a business, trade or profession carried on
  in this state.
    (c) Cross references.--(1) For valuation of property includible in the
  New  York  gross estate if the decedent had been a resident, see section
  nine hundred fifty-four.
    (2) For provisions of the internal  revenue  code  applicable  to  the
  federal  gross  estate  of  a  decedent who was neither a resident nor a
  citizen of the United States, see:
    Sec. 2103. Definition of gross estate.
    Sec. 2104. Property within the United States.
    Sec. 2105. Property without the United States.
    (d)  Works  of  art  on  loan  for  exhibition.  Notwithstanding   the
  foregoing,  the  tax imposed under subsection (a) of this section on the
  transfer, from any deceased individual who at his or her death was not a
  resident of the state of New York, of works  of  art  having  an  actual
  situs  in  the state of New York and either (i) includible in his or her
  federal gross estate or (ii) which would be includible in his or her New
  York gross estate pursuant to section nine hundred fifty-seven (relating
  to certain limited powers of appointment) if he or she were  a  resident
  of  the  state  of  New York, shall not be subject to the tax imposed by
  this section if such works of art are loaned to a public gallery located
  within the state of New York solely for exhibition purposes but only  if
  no  part  of  the net earnings of such public gallery or museum inure to
  the benefit of any private stockholder or individual, and, at  the  time
  of  the  death of such individual such works of art are on exhibition or
  en route to or from exhibition in such a public gallery or museum.






	   §  960-a.  Reciprocity.  The tax imposed by this article in respect of
  personal property (except tangible personal property  having  an  actual
  situs  in  this  state)  shall  not  be  payable  if the transferor is a
  resident of a state or territory of the United States the laws of which,
  at the time of the transfer,  contained  a  reciprocal  provision  under
  which  nonresidents  were exempted from transfer taxes or death taxes of
  every  character  in  respect  of  personal  property  (except  tangible
  personal  property having an actual situs therein) provided the state or
  territory of residence of such nonresident allowed a  similar  exemption
  to  residents of the state or territory of residence of such transferor.
  For the purposes of this section,  the  District  of  Columbia  and  the
  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico  shall  be  considered territories of the
  United States.




   § 961. Effect of federal determination. (a) General.-- A final federal
  determination as to
    (1)  the inclusion in the federal gross estate of any item of property
  or interest in property,
    (2) the allowance of any item claimed as a deduction from the  federal
  gross estate, or
    (3)  the  value  or  amount of any such item, shall also determine the
  same issue for purposes of the tax under this article unless such  final
  federal  determination is shown by a preponderance of the evidence to be
  erroneous.
    (b) Definition.-- For the purpose of  this  section  a  final  federal
  determination means:
    (1)  A  decision by the tax court or a judgment, decree or other order
  by any court of competent jurisdiction which has become final.
    (2) A final disposition by  the  secretary  of  the  treasury  or  his
  delegate of a claim for refund. Such disposition shall be deemed to have
  occurred--
    (A)  as  to  items  of  the claim which are allowed, upon allowance of
  refund or upon disallowance of the claim by reason of offsetting  items;
  and
    (B)  as  to  items  of  the claim which are disallowed, or as to items
  applied by the secretary of the treasury or his delegate  as  an  offset
  against  the claim, (i) upon expiration of the time for instituting suit
  for refund with respect to such items, unless suit is instituted  before
  the  expiration  of such time, or (ii) upon filing with the surrogate or
  appraiser a written statement, in such form as may be  required  by  the
  tax commission, that suit for refund will not be instituted.
    (3)  A closing agreement made under section seven thousand one hundred
  twenty-one of the internal revenue code.
    (4) An assessment pursuant to a waiver of restrictions on  assessment,
  or  a notification in writing issued by the secretary of the treasury or
  his delegate that the federal estate tax return  has  been  accepted  as
  filed  where  such notification is issued after an audit of such return,
  unless the executor shall have filed with the commissioner  of  taxation
  and  finance a written statement, in such form as may be required by the
  commissioner, that a claim for refund of federal estate taxes  has  been
  or will be filed.
    (c)   Items   determined.--   If   there  has  been  a  final  federal
  determination with respect to a decedent's federal estate tax, any  item
  entering  into  the computation of such tax shall be deemed to have been
  the  subject  of  the  final  federal  determination,  whether  or   not
  specifically adjusted thereby.




   §  971. Estate tax returns. (a) Returns by executor. (1) Residents. In
  the case of the estate of every  individual  dying  on  or  after  April
  first,  two thousand fourteen, who at his or her death was a resident of
  New York state, his or her executor shall make a return with respect  to
  the estate tax imposed by section nine hundred fifty-two of this article
  if  the  decedent's federal gross estate, increased by the amount of any
  gift includible in his or her New York gross estate, exceeds  the  basic
  exclusion amount applicable to the decedent's date of death in paragraph
  two of subsection (c) of section nine hundred fifty-two of this article.
    (2)  Nonresidents. In the case of the estate of every individual dying
  on or after April first, two thousand fourteen, who at his or her  death
  was not a resident of New York state, if such individual's federal gross
  estate  includes  real  or  tangible  personal property having an actual
  situs in New York state, the executor shall make a return  with  respect
  to  the estate tax imposed by section nine hundred sixty of this article
  if the decedent's federal gross estate, increased by the amount  of  any
  gift  includible  in his or her New York gross estate, exceeds the basic
  exclusion amount applicable to the decedent's date of death in paragraph
  two of subsection (c) of section nine hundred fifty-two of this article.
    (b) Joint fiduciaries. If two or more executors  are  acting  jointly,
  the return may be made by any one of them.
    (c) Tax a debt. Any tax under this article, and any increase, interest
  or  penalty  thereon, shall, from the time of the death of the decedent,
  be a debt owed by the estate of the decedent and from the time it is due
  and payable, be a personal debt of the person liable to pay the same, to
  the state of New York.
    (d) Cross reference. For requirement of filing  federal  returns,  see

   §   971-a.   Additional  proceedings  in  estates  of  non-domiciliary
  decedents. (a) Condition to appointment  of  executor  for  nonresident.
  Every  petition  for ancillary letters testamentary or of administration
  and  every  petition   for   original   letters   testamentary   or   of
  administration  in the estate of a decedent who at the time of his death
  was not domiciled in this state, shall set  forth  the  commissioner  of
  taxation  and  finance as a party to be cited, and upon the presentation
  thereof  the  surrogate  shall  issue  a  citation   directed   to   the
  commissioner.  The  decree  of  the  surrogate  awarding the letters may
  contain any provision for the payment of the tax imposed by this article
  or the giving of security therefor which might be made by such surrogate
  if the commissioner of taxation and  finance  were  a  creditor  of  the
  decedent.
    (b)  Notification  in  case  of  estate  of  nonresident. Whenever the
  commissioner of taxation  and  finance  is  cited  on  the  issuance  of
  original  letters  testamentary  or of administration in the estate of a
  decedent not domiciled in this state as provided in  subsection  (a)  of
  this   section,   the   commissioner  shall  notify  the  proper  taxing
  authorities of the state in which such decedent  was  domiciled  of  the
  fact  of  the  filing  of  the  petition  and  shall furnish information
  submitted by the executor to  the  commissioner  as  to  the  decedent's
  property  and  value  thereof.  No executor shall be entitled to a final
  accounting or discharge in a surrogate's court of this state  unless  he
  shall  have  filed with the surrogate, in addition to the certificate or
  final receipt required under section nine  hundred  eighty-one  of  this
  article,  (i)  proof  that  all  death taxes, together with interest and
  penalties thereon, due to the state of domicile of such decedent  or  to
  any  political  subdivision thereof have been paid or secured, or (ii) a
  consent by the proper taxing authorities of the  state  of  domicile  to
  such final accounting or discharge.
    (c)  Domiciliary  state's  tax  authority  as  interested party.   The
  official charged with administration  of  the  death  tax  laws  of  the
  domiciliary  state shall be deemed a party interested in the estate of a
  deceased individual who at his death was not  a  resident  of  New  York
  state,  to  the extent that such official may petition for an accounting
  therein  if  the  death  taxes,  interest  and  penalties  due  to  such
  domiciliary  state  or  a  political subdivision thereof are not paid or
  secured. Upon such petition the surrogate may decree such accounting and
  may decree the remission to a fiduciary  appointed  by  the  domiciliary
  probate  court of so much of the personal property of such estate as may
  be necessary to  insure  the  payment  to  the  state  of  domicile,  or
  political  subdivision  thereof,  of the amount of death taxes, interest
  and penalties due to such state or political subdivision.
    (d) Requirement of reciprocity. This section shall apply to the estate
  of a deceased individual who at his death was not a resident of New York
  state only (i) if the laws of  the  state  of  his  domicile  contain  a
  provision,  of  any  nature  or however expressed, whereby this state is
  given reasonable  assurance  of  the  collection  of  its  death  taxes,
  interest and penalties, from the estates of decedents dying domiciled in
  this  state  in  cases  where  the  estates  of such decedents are being
  administered by the probate court of  such  other  state  by  virtue  of
  original letters testamentary or of administration, or (ii) if the state
  in which such decedent was domiciled does not grant letters testamentary
  or  of  administration  in  estates of nonresidents, until after letters
  have been issued by the state of domicile.
    (e)  Cooperation  by  commissioner  of  taxation  and   finance.   The
  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance shall cooperate with the taxing
  authorities of the state of domicile of a deceased individual who at his


 death was not a resident of New York state and shall furnish  them  with
  such  information  as  may be requested with respect to any such estate.
  The provisions of this section shall be liberally  construed  to  insure
  that  the  state of domicile of a decedent shall receive any death taxes
  together with interest and  penalties  thereon,  due  to  it  from  such
  decedent's estate.
    (f)  Definition  of  state.  For the purpose of this section, the term
  "state" means the states of the United States, the District of Columbia,
  any territory of the United States and the Dominion  of  Canada  or  any
  province thereof.




   § 972. Time and place for filing returns. (a) Time for filing returns.
  A  person  required  to  make and file a return under this article shall
  file returns, statements, or other documents, or copies thereof,  within
  nine months after the date of the decedent's death.
    (b) Place for filing returns. The commissioner of taxation and finance
  shall  prescribe  the  place  for  filing  any  return, statement, other
  document, or copies thereof, required to be filed with such commissioner
  pursuant to this article.
    (c) Simultaneous filing of returns with surrogate's court. If required
  by rule of any surrogate's court, a person required  to  make  and  file
  returns,  statements,  or other documents, or copies thereof, under this
  article shall simultaneously file a  duplicate  copy  of  such  returns,
  statements,  or other documents, or copies thereof, with the surrogate's
  court in the county where the petition was filed to  commence  either  a
  proceeding  for  probate of a will or a proceeding for administration in
  intestacy. The office of court administration shall promptly notify  the
  commissioner  after  receiving  notice  that  any  surrogate's court has
  adopted such a rule, so that the commissioner will be able  to  properly
  inform   taxpayers   of  their  responsibility  to  file  such  returns,
  statements or other documents with the surrogate's court.




   §  973.  Signing  of  returns  and other documents. (a) General.   Any
  return, statement or other document required to be made pursuant to this
  article shall be signed in accordance with  instructions  prescribed  by
  the commissioner of taxation and finance.
    (b)  Signature  presumed  authentic.  The  fact  that  the name of the
  executor or other individual is signed to a return, statement  or  other
  document,  or  copies  thereof,  shall  be  prima facie evidence for all
  purposes that the return, statement  or  other  document,  or  copy  was
  actually signed by him.
    (c)  Certifications.  The making or filing of any return, statement or
  other document, or copy thereof, required to be made or  filed  pursuant
  to  this article, including a copy of a federal return, shall constitute
  a certification by the person making or filing such return, statement or
  other document or copy thereof that the statements contained therein are
  true and that any copy filed is a true copy.




   §  974.  Payment  of tax. (a) General. The tax imposed by this article
  shall without assessment, or notice and  demand  be  paid  at  the  time
  prescribed  in  this  article  by  the executor, subject to being by him
  charged against and collected from the persons interested in the estate,
  to the commissioner of taxation and finance.
    (b) Payment. The entire tax due shall, unless  otherwise  provided  in
  this  article, be paid on or before the date fixed for filing the return
  required under this article.
    (c) Cross reference. For interest on underpayment,  see  sections  six
  hundred eighty-four and nine hundred ninety of this chapter.




   § 975. Liability for tax. (a) Duty of executor to pay tax. (1) The tax
  imposed  by  this  article  shall  be  paid  by  the executor, who shall
  thereupon charge the same  against  and  collect  it  from  the  persons
  interested  in  the estate in accordance with the rules of apportionment
  of section 2-1.8 and other relevant provisions of  the  estates,  powers
  and trusts law.
    (2)  If  the tax imposed by this article, or any part thereof, is paid
  by, or collected out of, that part of the estate passing to  or  in  the
  possession  of  any  person  other  than the executor in his capacity as
  such, such person shall be entitled to reimbursement out of any part  of
  the  estate  still undistributed or by a just and equitable contribution
  by the persons whose interest in the estate of the decedent  would  have
  been  reduced  if  the  tax had been paid before the distribution of the
  estate or whose interest is subject to equal or prior liability for  the
  payment  of  taxes,  debts or other charges against the estate, it being
  the purpose and intent of this section that so far as is practicable and
  unless otherwise directed by the will or non-testamentary instrument  of
  the  decedent,  the  tax  shall  be  paid  out  of the estate before its
  distribution.
    (b) Liability of executor. An executor who pays, in whole or in  part,
  any  debt  due by the estate for which he or she acts, except for a debt
  owed to the United States or to New York state, or who  distributes  any
  asset  of the estate, prior to the payment in full of the tax imposed by
  this article, shall be answerable in his or her own  person  and  estate
  for  the payment of such tax to the extent that the assets of the estate
  have been so paid out or distributed.  The  liability  of  the  executor
  under  this  subsection  shall  continue  until  his or her discharge as
  provided in section nine hundred eighty-one of this article.
    (c) Liability of life insurance  beneficiaries.  Unless  the  decedent
  directs  otherwise in his or her will, if any part of the New York gross
  estate on which tax has been paid consists of proceeds  of  policies  of
  insurance  on the life of the decedent receivable by a beneficiary other
  than the executor, the executor shall be entitled to recover  from  such
  beneficiary  such  portion of the total tax paid as the proceeds of such
  policies bear to the federal taxable estate, reduced by the value of any
  real or tangible personal property located outside New York  state,  and
  increased  by  any  federal  estate  tax deductions attributable to such
  property. If there is more than one such beneficiary, the executor shall
  be entitled to recover from such beneficiaries in the same ratio. In the
  case of such proceeds receivable by the surviving spouse of the decedent
  for which a deduction is allowed under section two thousand fifty-six of
  the internal revenue code (relating to marital deduction), this  section
  shall not apply to such proceeds.
    (d)  Liability of recipients of property over which decedent had power
  of appointment. Unless the decedent directs  otherwise  in  his  or  her
  will, if any part of the New York gross estate on which the tax has been
  paid  consists  of  the  value  of property included in the gross estate
  under section two thousand forty-one of the internal revenue  code,  the
  executor  shall  be  entitled  to recover from the person receiving such
  property by reason of the exercise, nonexercise, or release of  a  power
  of  appointment  such portion of the total tax paid as the value of such
  property bears to the federal taxable estate, reduced by  the  value  of
  any  real  or tangible personal property located outside New York state,
  and increased by any federal estate tax deductions attributable to  such
  property.  If  there is more than one such person, the executor shall be
  entitled to recover from such persons in the same ratio. In the case  of
  such property received by the surviving spouse of the decedent for which
  a  deduction  is  allowed  under  section  two thousand fifty-six of the


 internal revenue code (relating  to  marital  deduction),  this  section
  shall not apply to such property.
    (e)  Liability  of  transferees and others. If the tax imposed by this
  article is not paid when due,  then  the  spouse,  transferee,  trustee,
  surviving  tenant, person in possession of the property by reason of the
  exercise,  nonexercise,  or  release  of  a  power  of  appointment,  or
  beneficiary,  who  receives, or has on the date of the decedent's death,
  property included in the New York gross estate  to  the  extent  of  the
  value,  at  the time of the decedent's death, of such property, shall be
  personally liable for such tax. Any part of such property transferred by
  (or transferred by a transferee of) such  spouse,  transferee,  trustee,
  surviving  tenant,  person  in  possession  of property by reason of the
  exercise,  nonexercise,  or  release  of  a  power  of  appointment,  or
  beneficiary,  to  a  bona  fide purchaser, mortgagee, or pledgee, for an
  adequate and full consideration in  money  or  money's  worth  shall  be
  divested of the lien provided in section nine hundred eighty-two of this
  article  and  a  like lien shall then attach to all the property of such
  spouse, transferee, trustee, surviving  tenant,  person  in  possession,
  beneficiary,   or  transferee  of  any  such  person,  except  any  part
  transferred to a bona fide  purchaser,  mortgagee,  or  pledgee  for  an
  adequate  and  full  consideration  in money or money's worth. Provided,
  however, where any interest in such property was held  by  the  decedent
  and  the  decedent's  surviving  spouse as tenants by the entirety, such
  interest in such property shall be divested  of  the  lien  provided  in
  section nine hundred eighty-two of this article.




   §  976.  Extensions  of  time.  (a)  General.  (1) The commissioner of
  taxation and finance may  grant  a  reasonable  extension  of  time  for
  payment of tax (or any installment), or for filing any return, statement
  or  other  document required pursuant to this article, on such terms and
  conditions as he may require. Except in the case of  executors  who  are
  outside  the  United  States,  no  such extension for filing any return,
  statement or other document shall exceed six months. Except as otherwise
  provided in this article, no such extension  for  payment  shall  exceed
  twelve months from the date fixed for payment.
    (2) Where there is included in the value of the gross estate the value
  of  a reversionary or remainder interest in property, the payment of the
  part of the tax imposed by this article attributable  to  such  interest
  may,  at  the  election  of  the executor, be postponed until six months
  after the termination of the precedent  interest  or  interests  in  the
  property, and the amount the payment of which is so postponed shall then
  be  payable,  together  with  interest  thereon.  If the commissioner of
  taxation and finance finds that the payment of the tax within  such  six
  months   would   result  in  undue  hardship  to  the  estate  and  said
  commissioner has approved payment in respect of such tax over  a  longer
  period, he may extend the time for a payment for a reasonable period not
  in  excess  of  three  years from the expiration of such six months. The
  postponement of the payment of any  such  amount  shall  be  under  such
  regulations  as  the commissioner of taxation and finance may prescribe,
  and shall be upon condition that  the  executor,  or  any  other  person
  liable  for  the  tax,  shall comply with subsection (c) of this section
  (relating to furnishing of security).
    (3) If the commissioner of taxation and finance finds that the payment
  on the due date of any part of the amount of the  tax  imposed  by  this
  article  would result in undue hardship to the estate, he may extend the
  time for payment for such period as he may deem reasonable, but  not  to
  exceed  four years from the date of death, and may require payment to be
  made in annual installments.
    (b) Whenever the commissioner extends the time for the payment of  tax
  under  this section, that portion of the tax as to which an extension is
  granted shall bear interest from the date the  tax  is  required  to  be
  paid, to the date of payment without regard to any extension of time for
  the  payment  of the tax or filing of the return, at the rate prescribed
  in subsection (a) of section six hundred eighty-four of this chapter.
    (c) Furnishing of security. If any extension of time  is  granted  for
  payment  of  any amount of tax, the commissioner of taxation and finance
  may require the taxpayer to furnish a bond issued by  a  surety  company
  approved  by the superintendent of financial services as to solvency and
  responsibility and authorized to transact  business  in  this  state  or
  other  security  acceptable  to  such  commissioner  in  an  amount  not
  exceeding twice the amount for which the extension of time  for  payment
  is  granted,  on  such  terms  and  conditions  as such commissioner may
  require.
    (d) Cross reference. For extensions of time for payment of estate  tax
  where an estate consists largely of interest in closely held businesses,
  see section nine hundred ninety-seven of this article.
    (e)  If  the  decedent  has  a  cause of action pending at the time of
  death, or a cause of action arises which is related  to  the  decedent's
  death, and any recovery under the cause of action is to be taxable under
  this  article,  the  commissioner  shall  waive any penalty and interest
  associated with such cause of action which accrues from  the  date  that
  the  return disclosing such cause of action is filed, provided that such
  penalty and interest may not be waived for periods beyond one year after
  the date of final judgment or settlement of the cause of action.




   §   977.   Requirements   concerning  returns,  notices,  records  and
  statements. (a) General. The commissioner of taxation  and  finance  may
  prescribe regulations as to the keeping of records, the content and form
  of  returns,  statements or other documents, and the filing of copies of
  federal estate tax returns  and  determinations.  The  commissioner  may
  require  any  executor  or  other  person, by regulation, instruction or
  notice served upon such person,  to  make  such  returns  or  documents,
  render  such  statements,  or  keep such records as the commissioner may
  deem sufficient to show whether or not such executor or other person  is
  liable under this article for tax.
    (b) Federal return. (1) If a federal estate tax return is required for
  federal  estate tax purposes, a copy thereof, together with such summary
  and additional information as the commissioner of taxation  and  finance
  may prescribe, shall be filed with the return of tax under this article.
    For  the  purposes  of  this article, the phrase "return, statement or
  other document" shall include a copy of the federal estate  tax  return,
  document or statement.
    (2)  If a federal estate tax return is not required for federal estate
  tax purposes, the return of tax under this article  shall  include  such
  schedules  and  information  as the commissioner of taxation and finance
  shall prescribe.
    (c) Identifying numbers. (1) When  required  by  the  commissioner  of
  taxation and finance:
    (A)  Inclusion  in returns. Any person required under the authority of
  this article to make a return, statement, or other document,  or  copies
  thereof,  shall include in such return, statement, or other document, or
  copies thereof,  such  identifying  number  as  may  be  prescribed  for
  securing proper identification of such person, or of the decedent.
    (B)  Furnishing  number  to  other persons. Any person with respect to
  whom a return,  statement,  or  other  document,  or  copy  thereof,  is
  required  under  the  authority  of  this  article to be made by another
  person shall furnish to such other person such identifying number as may
  be prescribed for securing his proper identification.
    (C) Furnishing number of another person. Any person required under the
  authority of  this  article  to  make  a  return,  statement,  or  other
  document, or copy thereof, with respect to another person, shall request
  from such other person, and shall include in any such return, statement,
  or  other  document,  or copy thereof, such identifying number as may be
  prescribed for securing proper identification of such other person.
    (2) Limitation. For purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph
  (1) of this subsection, a  return,  statement,  or  other  document,  or
  copies  thereof,  of  an  estate, with respect to its liability for tax,
  shall be considered as a return, statement, or other document, or copies
  thereof, with respect to each beneficiary  of  such  estate  under  this
  article.
    (3)  Requirement  of information. For purposes of this subsection, the
  commissioner of taxation and  finance  is  authorized  to  require  such
  information  as  may be necessary to assign an identifying number to any
  person or estate.
    (4) Use of social security account number. The social security account
  number issued to an individual may, except as otherwise specified by the
  commissioner of taxation and finance, be used as the identifying  number
  for such individual for purposes of this title.
    (d)  Notice  of  qualification  as executor. Every executor shall give
  notice of his qualifications as such to the commissioner of taxation and
  finance in such manner and at such  time  as  may  be  required  by  the
  commissioner.  The  commissioner  may  provide  such exemptions from the
  requirements of this section as he deems proper.




   §  978.  Compromise  agreements  in  cases of disputed domicile.   (a)
  Determining tax under this article. Where the commissioner  of  taxation
  and  finance  claims  that a decedent was domiciled in this state at the
  time of his death and the taxing authorities of another state or  states
  make  a  similar  claim  with  respect  to  their  state  or states, the
  commissioner of taxation and finance may enter into a written  agreement
  with  such  taxing  officials  and  with the executor that a certain sum
  shall be accepted in full payment of the tax imposed  by  this  article,
  provided  that  said  agreement also fixes the amount to be paid to such
  other state or states in full payment of the death taxes  thereof.  Full
  power  and authority is hereby conferred upon the executor to enter into
  the agreement provided for herein. The execution of such agreement shall
  finally and conclusively fix and determine the amount of tax imposed  by
  this  article,  except  as  otherwise  provided  in  such agreement with
  respect to the valuation of estates devoted to farming or  closely  held
  business  and  except  as  provided  in  subsection (b) of this section,
  without regard to any other provision of the laws of this state.
    (b) Payment of agreed tax. The executor shall pay to the  commissioner
  of  taxation  and  finance  the  amount  of  tax  fixed in the agreement
  described in subsection (a) of this section. In the event the  aggregate
  amount  payable under such agreement to the states involved is less than
  the maximum credit allowable to the estate  against  the  United  States
  estate  tax  imposed  with respect thereto, the executor forthwith shall
  also pay to the commissioner of taxation and  finance  so  much  of  the
  difference  between such aggregate amount and the amount of such credit,
  as the amount payable to the commissioner under the agreement  bears  to
  such aggregate amount.
    (c)  Definition.  As  used  in this section the word "state" means any
  state, territory, or possession of the United States,  the  District  of
  Columbia and the Dominion of Canada or any province thereof.




   §  979.  Report  of change in federal taxable estate, adjusted taxable
  gifts, additional estate tax imposed by section 2032A  of  the  internal
  revenue  code.  (a) General. If the amount of the federal taxable estate
  reported on the federal estate tax return for an estate  is  changed  or
  corrected  by  the  United  States  internal  revenue  service  or other
  competent authority, the executor shall report such change or correction
  in the federal  taxable  estate  within  ninety  days  after  the  final
  determination  of  such change or correction or as otherwise required by
  the commissioner of taxation and finance, and shall concede the accuracy
  of such determination or state wherein it  is  erroneous.  Any  executor
  filing  an  amended  federal  estate  tax  return shall also file within
  ninety days thereafter an amended return under this article,  and  shall
  give  such  further  information  as  the  commissioner may require. The
  commissioner  may  by  regulation  prescribe  such  exceptions  to   the
  requirements of this section as he or she deems appropriate.
    (b) Final federal determination. The executor of every estate which is
  subject to the United States estate tax shall file with the commissioner
  of  taxation  and  finance  a  copy  of  the final federal determination
  thereof forthwith after the same is made.




   §  979-a.  Notification by surrogate to commissioner concerning tax. A
  surrogate, in his discretion, may notify the  commissioner  of  taxation
  and  finance  of  any  and  all  matters  which  come to the surrogate's
  attention as a result of any proceeding commenced in surrogate's  court,
  or  the  filing therein of papers or documents, and which affect the tax
  imposed by this article.




   §  980.  Change  of election. The commissioner of taxation and finance
  may change, by regulation, any election  expressly  authorized  by  this
  article  in  order  to  conform  such election to its equivalent federal
  election.




   §  981.  Discharge from liability. (a) Certificate of no tax due. If a
  return has been filed and  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance
  determines  that  no  tax  is  due,  he  shall  issue  to the executor a
  certificate that no tax is due.
    (b) Final receipt for tax due. If a return  has  been  filed  and  the
  commissioner  of  taxation and finance is satisfied that the tax paid is
  the full amount of tax due, he shall  issue  to  the  executor  a  final
  receipt for tax due.
    (c)  Final receipt for agreed tax. If the commissioner of taxation and
  finance  enters  into  an   agreement   under   section   nine   hundred
  seventy-eight  of  this  article  (relating  to compromise agreements in
  cases of disputed domicile) and if the amount due under such section  is
  paid, he shall issue to the executor a final receipt for tax due.
    (d)  Discharge of executor upon accounting. If a return is required to
  be filed under section nine hundred seventy-one of this article,  except
  as provided in subdivision three of section eighteen hundred four of the
  surrogate's  court  procedure  act,  no  executor shall be entitled to a
  final accounting or discharge in the surrogate's  court  unless  he  has
  filed with the surrogate's court a certificate under subsection (a) or a
  final  receipt  under  subsection  (b)  or  (c)  of  this  section.  For
  additional requirement in case of  the  estate  of  a  nonresident,  see
  section nine hundred seventy-one-a of this article.
    (e)  Duplicate  certificate  or  receipt. Any person interested in the
  estate shall, upon request, be entitled to a duplicate certificate of no
  tax due or duplicate final receipt for tax due or for  agreed  tax  upon
  the payment of ten dollars to the commissioner of taxation and finance.
    (f)  Record  of  access  to  safe  deposit  boxes. The commissioner of
  taxation and finance may by regulation prescribe requirements  for  safe
  deposit  companies, trust companies, banks, corporations, firms or other
  persons holding safe deposit boxes for rental to the public to  maintain
  and  retain  records  as to the persons who have had access to such safe
  deposit boxes.
    (g) Cross reference. For criminal penalties for unlawful entry of safe
  deposit box, see article thirty-seven of this chapter.




   §  982.  Lien  for  estate tax. (a) General. Unless the tax imposed by
  this article is sooner paid in  full,  it  shall  be  a  lien  upon  all
  property  includible  in  the  New York gross estate of the decedent for
  fifteen years from the date of death of the decedent, except  that  such
  part  of the New York gross estate as is used for the payment of charges
  against the estate and expenses of its administration,  allowed  by  any
  court  having  jurisdiction  thereof, shall be divested of such lien. In
  the case of a decedent who at his death was not a resident of  New  York
  state,  the  lien  shall apply to all property subject to tax under this
  article.
    (b) Prior mortgages on real property. The lien under subsection (a) of
  this section shall be subject to the lien of any  mortgage  indebtedness
  on  real  property incurred in good faith prior to the time when the tax
  under this article became a lien. Such real property  may  be  sold  and
  conveyed  free  from  any  such  tax lien in an action to foreclose such
  mortgage to which the people of the state of New York  shall  have  been
  made  a  party  defendant by reason of the existence of the lien for the
  tax. The lien may then attach to any surplus moneys  which  result  from
  such  sale,  to be determined in the proceedings for the distribution of
  such surplus moneys.
    (c) Discharge of lien.--Subject to such rules or  regulations  as  the
  commissioner  may prescribe, the commissioner may issue a certificate of
  discharge of any or all of the property subject to the lien  imposed  by
  this  section if he or she finds that the liability secured by such lien
  has been fully satisfied or provided  for,  upon  application  for  such
  discharge. A certificate of discharge issued under this subsection shall
  be  held  conclusive  that  the  lien  upon  the property covered by the
  certificate is extinguished.
    (d) Recording of certificate of discharge. A certificate of  discharge
  issued  under  subsection  (c)  of  this  section may be recorded in the
  office of the recording  officer  of  the  county  where  real  property
  described therein is situated.
    (e)  Power  of executor to sell. The executor shall have full power to
  sell so much of the property of the estate as will enable him to pay the
  tax imposed by this article in the same manner that he is  permitted  by
  law to do for payment of debts of the estate.

 the judicial district in which the county is included. Where a city pays
  the  salary  of a surrogate of a county wholly included within such city
  and such salary is equal to the entire salary and compensation paid to a
  justice  of  the  supreme  court  in  the judicial district in which the
  county is included, the state shall pay such  city  on  behalf  of  such
  county  the  sum  of  six  thousand  eight  hundred  eighty-two  dollars
  multiplied by the number of surrogates in such county.  Where  a  county
  pays  the  salary  of a surrogate and such salary is equal to the entire
  compensation paid to a justice of the  supreme  court  in  the  judicial
  district  in  which  the  county  is  included, the state shall pay such
  county  the  sum  of  six  thousand  eight  hundred  eighty-two  dollars
  multiplied  by  the  number of surrogates in such county. The additional
  compensation provided for by this subsection shall  be  payable  in  the
  same  manner  as  salaries  and  expenses under this section. The moneys
  provided to be paid by this subsection to a city or county  in  lieu  of
  additional  compensation  shall  be paid upon warrant of the comptroller
  drawn in favor of the city treasurer  of  the  city  or  of  the  county
  treasurer of the county due such amount, which sum shall be paid to said
  city or county treasurer out of any moneys in the treasury not otherwise
  appropriated.
    (d)(1)  In  each  county  of  the  state  the  surrogate shall receive
  annually  for  such   services   rendered   in   connection   with   the
  administration  of  transfer  and  estate  taxes  as are not incident to
  holding courts or performing duties as a judicial officer the respective
  sums following:
    (A) In any such county having a population of less than ten  thousand,
  five hundred seventy-three dollars;
    (B) In any such county having a population of ten thousand or more but
  less than fifty thousand, one thousand eight hundred eighty-six dollars;
    (C)  In  any such county having a population of fifty thousand or more
  but less than one hundred thousand, two thousand two hundred  twenty-one
  dollars;
    (D)  In any such county having a population of one hundred thousand or
  more but less than two hundred  thousand,  three  thousand  two  hundred
  thirty dollars;
    (E)  In any such county having a population of two hundred thousand or
  more but less than five hundred  thousand,  four  thousand  two  hundred
  fifty-one dollars;
    (F) In any such county having a population of five hundred thousand or
  more, six thousand eight hundred fifty-one dollars.
    (2)  No  provision  of  this  subsection  shall  repeal  or affect the
  provisions of subsection (c) of this section, but the provisions of this
  subsection shall apply to  the  surrogate  or  surrogates  mentioned  in
  subsection  (c)  of  this section, provided that any payment or payments
  made to him or them, whether under this subsection or subsection (c), or
  both, shall not in all exceed the sum  of  six  thousand  eight  hundred
  eighty-two dollars annually. Such sum shall not, however, in addition to
  the  salary or compensation paid to any surrogate by the state, together
  exceed the entire salary and compensation  paid  to  a  justice  of  the
  supreme  court in the judicial district in which the county is included.
  The moneys provided to be paid for services by this subsection shall  be
  payable  in the same manner as salaries and expenses under this section.
  Such salaries and expenses shall be paid upon proper  vouchers,  out  of
  moneys appropriated for such purpose.
    (e)  The  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  is  authorized  to
  designate and retain counsel to represent the department and to pay  the
  expenses  thereby incurred out of money appropriated for such purpose in
  the following circumstances:


   (1) when the department is cited as a party under section nine hundred
  seventy-one-a of this article,
    (2) in a special proceeding under section nine hundred ninety-eight or
  any appeal therefrom, of this article,
    (3)  to  examine  securities,  deposits  or  other  assets pursuant to
  subsection (e) of section nine hundred seventy-five of this article, and

  of law, in computing the interest due on an addition to tax owed  by  an
  estate  attributable  to  the  inclusion  in  the estate's federal gross

  taxation  and finance, any person engaged or retained by such department
  on an independent contract basis, or any person who,  pursuant  to  this
  section, is permitted to inspect any report or return or to whom a copy,
  an  abstract  or  a  portion of any report or return is furnished, or to
  whom any information contained in any report or return is furnished,  to
  divulge  or  make  known  in  any  manner the value of the estate or any
  particulars set forth or disclosed in  any  report  or  return  required
  under this article.
    (2)  The officers charged with the custody of such reports and returns
  shall not be required to produce any of them  or  evidence  of  anything
  contained  in  them  in any action or proceeding in any court, except on
  behalf of the commissioner of taxation  and  finance  in  an  action  or
  proceeding  under the provisions of this chapter, or in any other action
  or proceeding involving the collection of a tax due under  this  chapter
  to  which  the  state  or  the commissioner of taxation and finance is a
  party or claimant, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding
  under the provisions of this article when the reports, returns or  facts
  shown  thereby  are directly involved in such action or proceeding or in
  any proceeding under the surrogate's court procedure act to  assist  the
  surrogate  to  carry  out his powers or duties under such act including,
  but not limited to  the  determination  of  the  amount  of  court  fees
  required  to  be  paid  under article twenty-four of such act, in any of
  which events the court may require the production of, and may  admit  in
  evidence,  so  much  of  said  reports,  returns  or  of the facts shown
  thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more.
    (3) Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the  delivery  to  a
  surrogate  or to any person liable for the payment of the tax imposed by
  this article or such liable person's duly authorized representative of a
  certified copy of any return, correspondence  or  other  data  filed  in
  connection with the tax for which such person is liable or a copy of any
  workpaper,   document  or  other  data  prepared  or  developed  by  the
  department during the processing, audit or investigation of that  return
  or  the  collection  of the tax derived therefrom or the delivery of any
  such copy to any person interested in the estate, any heir at law,  next
  of  kin,  or beneficiary under the will, of such decedent, or a donee of
  property, but only if the commissioner or the surrogate, as the case may
  be, finds that such person, heir at law, next of  kin,  beneficiary,  or
  donee  has  a  material  interest  which will be affected by information
  contained  therein.  Further,  nothing  herein  shall  be  construed  to
  prohibit  the  publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the
  identification of particular reports or returns and the  items  thereof,
  or the inspection by the attorney general or other legal representatives
  of  the state of the return of any person (or any report related to such
  return or any copy mentioned in the preceding sentence) who shall  bring
  action  to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an
  action or proceeding under this chapter  has  been  recommended  by  the
  commissioner  or  the  attorney  general  or has been instituted, or the
  inspection of the reports or returns required under this article by  the
  comptroller  or  duly  designated  officer  or  employee  of  the  state
  department of audit and control, for purposes of the audit of  a  refund
  of  any  tax  paid  by  a  taxpayer under this article. Further, nothing
  contained herein shall be construed to prevent  an  examination  of  any
  documents  concerning  an  estate  that  are  under  the  control of the
  surrogate by a title abstractor, attorney at law or title examiner or to


 prevent a title abstractor, attorney  at  law  or  title  examiner  from
  applying  for  and  obtaining  a  discharge  of  lien in accordance with
  subsection (c) of section nine hundred eighty-two  of  this  article  or
  from receiving information needed in order to obtain such discharge, for
  the  sole  purpose  of insuring title to real property or a chattel real
  and/or preparing a title abstract, title  search,  or  title  report  in
  connection  with  real property or chattel real. The commissioner or the
  surrogate, as the case  may  be,  may  require  such  title  abstractor,
  attorney  at  law  or title examiner to certify that the sole purpose of
  such examination is for insuring title to real  property  or  a  chattel
  real  and/or  preparing  a title abstract, title search or title report.
  Furthermore, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the  delivery
  to  a  person entitled thereto under the provisions of this article of a
  receipt or certificate that the tax imposed under this article has  been
  paid, in whole or in part.
    (4)(A) Any officer or employee of the state who willfully violates the
  provisions  of  this  subsection  shall  be dismissed from office and be
  incapable of holding any public office in this state  for  a  period  of
  five years thereafter.

  commissioner of taxation and finance may permit  the  secretary  of  the
  treasury  of  the  United  States  or  his  delegates, or the proper tax
  officer of any state imposing an estate, inheritance or death tax on the
  transfer of the estate of a deceased individual or on  the  transfer  by
  will or the intestate laws of such state from any person dying seized or
  possessed of property in such state, or the authorized representative of
  either  such officer, to inspect any return filed under this article, or
  may furnish to such officer or his authorized representative an abstract
  of any such return or supply him with  information  concerning  an  item
  contained  in  any  such return, or disclosed by an investigation of tax
  liability under this article, but such permission shall  be  granted  or
  such information furnished to such officer or his representative only if
  the  laws  of  the United States or of such other state, as the case may
  be, grant  substantially  similar  privileges  to  the  commissioner  of
  taxation  and  finance  or such other officer of this state charged with
  the  administration  of  the  tax  imposed  by  this  article  and  such
  information  is  to  be used for tax purposes only; and provided further
  the commissioner of taxation and finance may furnish to the commissioner
  of internal revenue or his authorized representative such returns  filed
  under this article and other tax information, as he may consider proper,
  for use in court actions or proceedings under the internal revenue code,
  whether  civil  or  criminal,  where a written request therefor has been
  made to the commissioner of taxation and finance by the secretary of the
  treasury of the United States or his delegates, provided the laws of the
  United States grant substantially similar powers to the secretary of the
  treasury of the United States or his delegates. Where  the  commissioner
  of  taxation  and  finance  has  so  authorized use of returns and other
  information in such actions or proceedings, officers  and  employees  of
  the  department  of  taxation and finance may testify in such actions or
  proceedings in respect to such returns  or  other  information.  Nothing
  herein  shall be construed to prohibit the delivery of any return or the
  furnishing of information thereon by the commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance  to  the  taxing authorities of another state for the purpose of
  complying with the provisions of section nine hundred  seventy-one-a  of

  capacity in a position subject to  confirmation  by  the  United  States

  joint-stock  company,  trust  or  similar entity of which any individual
  listed in this paragraph  holds  ten  percent  or  more  of  the  voting
  securities  of  such  entity; provided however that, prior to furnishing
  any report or return, the  commissioner  shall  redact  any  copy  of  a
  federal return (or portion thereof) attached to, or any information on a
  federal  return  that  is  reflected  on, such report or return, and any
  social  security  numbers,  account  numbers  and  residential   address

  that  if  such  requested  reports  or  returns  are inspected by and/or

    (3) (A) A reproduction of a  report  or  return  shall,  upon  written

  of section 6166 of the internal revenue code shall apply to this section

  made part of this section (whether or not a federal estate tax return is
  required to be filed) except as provided herein:
    (a)  The  phrase  "adjusted  gross  estate" shall be read as "adjusted

  article  shall  be the same as is required under the federal estate tax.
  Where no federal estate tax return is required to be filed, the election
  with respect to the tax imposed under this  article  shall  be  made  no
  later  than  the date prescribed for the filing of the return under this
  article (including extensions thereof) or any  time  thereafter  as  the
  commissioner of taxation and finance may by regulation prescribe.
    (f) The commissioner of taxation and finance may, at any time, require
  a  bond  to  be  filed  with him, which bond has been issued by a surety
  company approved by the  superintendent  of  financial  services  as  to
  solvency  and responsibility and authorized to transact business in this
  state or other security acceptable to such commissioner,  in  an  amount
  not  exceeding  twice the amount for which the time for payment has been
  extended under this section, to secure the payment of the estate tax and
  interest, the time for payment of which has  been  extended  under  this
  section.
    (g)  If  an  acceleration  of  payment  occurs with respect to the tax
  imposed by this article, the extension of time for payment  of  the  tax
  imposed  by  this article shall cease to apply and any unpaid portion of
  the tax payable in installments shall be paid  upon  notice  and  demand
  from  the commissioner of taxation and finance. If any such acceleration
  of payment is avoided by a payment within six months  of  the  due  date
  thereof,  then  the  provisions  of  subsection (j) of this section with
  respect to a two percent rate  of  interest  shall  not  apply  to  said
  payment  and there is imposed a penalty of five percent of the amount of
  such payment multiplied by the number of months, or  fractions  thereof,
  after  the  due  date  of  the  payment and before payment is made. Such
  acceleration of payment shall occur if:
    (1) any installment of estate tax imposed by this article is not  paid
  on  or before the date fixed for its payment (including any extension of
  time for the payment of such installment), or
    (2) the executor has been notified by the commissioner of taxation and
  finance that a bond or other security is required, but no such  bond  or
  other  security  has  been  filed  within  thirty  days from the date of
  mailing of such notification, or
    (3) an acceleration of  payment  has  occurred  with  respect  to  the
  election by the executor to pay part or all of the federal estate tax in


 installments  or,  where  no federal estate tax return is required to be
  filed, an  acceleration  of  payment  has  occurred  by  virtue  of  the
  provisions  of  subsection  (g)  of section 6166 of the internal revenue
  code.
    (h) The commissioner of taxation and finance may, for reasonable cause
  and  if  his interests would not be jeopardized thereby, extend the time
  for payment of any  part  of  any  installment  under  this  subsection,
  including  any  part  of  a deficiency prorated to any installment under
  this subsection, for a reasonable period (1) not in excess of ten  years
  from the date prescribed for the filing of the return under this article
  (without  regard  to  any  extension of time to file) or (2) if the date
  prescribed for such filing is earlier than  the  date  which  is  twelve
  months after the due date of the last installment, such later date.
    (i)  If  the  time  for payment of any amount of tax has been extended
  under this subsection, interest shall be paid annually together with the
  installment of tax on any unpaid portion of such amount  (including  the
  amount  of  any deficiency), at the rate prescribed in subsection (b) of
  section nine  hundred  seventy-six  of  this  article  with  respect  to
  extensions  of time for payment of estate tax (other than the extensions
  of time provided for in this section) or as otherwise  provided  for  in
  subsection (j) of this section.
    (j)  If  the  time  for payment of any amount of tax has been extended
  under this section, the provisions  of  section  6166  of  the  internal
  revenue  code  applicable  to  the  payment  of interest are modified as
  follows:
    (1) Interest on the two percent portion of such amount shall  be  paid
  at  the rate of two percent per annum. For purposes of this section, the
  amount of any deficiency which is prorated to installments payable under
  this  section,  shall  be  treated  as  an  amount  of  tax  payable  in
  installments under such section.
    (2)  For  purposes  of  this paragraph, the term "two percent portion"
  means the lesser of fifty-four thousand dollars or the amount of the tax
  imposed by this article which is extended as provided in this section.
    (3) If the amount of tax imposed by this  article  which  is  extended
  exceeds the two percent portion, any payment of a portion of such amount
  shall,  for  purposes  of  computing  interest  for  periods  after such
  payment, be treated as reducing the two percent  portion  by  an  amount
  which  bears  the same ratio to the amount of such payment as the amount
  of the two percent portion (determined without regard to this paragraph)
  bears to the amount of tax which is extended.
    (4) Interest on any  portion  of  the  amount  of  tax  which  is  not
  includible in the two percent portion of such amount shall be payable at
  the rate provided for in subsection (i) of this section.
    (5)  (A)  Interest  payable on any unpaid portion of the amount of tax
  due attributable to the first five years after the date  prescribed  for
  payment of the tax shall be paid annually;
    (B)  interest  payable  on  any  unpaid  portion of such amount of tax
  attributable to any period after the five year  period  referred  to  in
  subparagraph  (A)  of  this paragraph shall be paid annually at the same
  time as and as part of, each installment payment of the tax;
    (C) in the case of a deficiency to which  subsection  (e)  of  section
  6166  of the internal revenue code applies is determined after the close
  of the five  year  period  referred  to  in  subparagraph  (A)  of  this
  paragraph,  interest attributable to such five year period, and interest
  assigned under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph  to  any  installment,
  the  date  of payment of which has arrived on or before the date of such
  determination,  shall  be  paid  upon  notice  and   demand   from   the
  commissioner of taxation and finance; and


   (D)  if  the  executor  has selected a period shorter than five years,
  such shorter period shall be substituted for five years in subparagraphs
  (A), (B) and (C) of this paragraph. Any period of time selected for  the
  purposes of the tax under this article shall in no event be greater than
  the period of time selected for the purpose of the estate tax imposed by
  the internal revenue code.
    (k)  The  lien  of  the  tax  provided  for  in  section  nine hundred
  eighty-two of this article shall be applicable to the same extent as  if
  no  election  had been made to extend the time for payment of estate tax
  under this section.




   §  998.  Petition  to the surrogate's court and appeal. (a) General. A
  taxpayer shall have the right to protest a notice  of  deficiency  or  a
  notice  of disallowance of a claim for refund issued by the commissioner
  of taxation and finance with  respect  to  tax  under  this  article  as
  provided  in  this  section.  A proceeding under this section shall be a
  special proceeding under article four of  the  civil  practice  law  and
  rules and shall be commenced by filing a notice of petition and verified
  petition  with  the  surrogate's  court  and  service  of such notice of
  petition and verified petition  on  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance  or  the  commissioner's  attorney.  In  any  county  which  has
  designated a transfer and estate clerk of the court, the filing  of  the
  notice  of  petition  and  verified  petition with the surrogate's court
  shall be effected  by  filing  such  notice  of  petition  and  verified
  petition  with  such  clerk.  The  notice of petition, together with the
  petition and any affidavits specified in the notice, shall be  so  filed
  and  served  at  least  forty-five  days  before  the  time at which the
  petition is noticed to be heard. An answer and supporting affidavits, if
  any, shall be served at least  ten  days  before  such  time.  A  reply,
  together  with  supporting  affidavits, if any, shall be served at least
  five days  before  such  time.  No  petition  shall  be  denied  without
  opportunity for a hearing of any issues of fact raised therein.
    (b) Conciliation conferences. The provisions of subdivision three-a of
  section  one  hundred  seventy  of  this  chapter regarding conciliation
  conferences in the bureau of conciliation and mediation  services  shall
  be  applicable with respect to a notice of deficiency or disallowance of
  a refund of tax under this article provided, however, the references  to
  "the  division  of tax appeals" shall be deemed to be references to "the
  surrogate's court" for purposes  of  the  tax  under  this  article  and
  references  to filing a petition shall be deemed to be references to the
  commencement of a special proceeding under this section.
    (c) Jurisdiction and venue. The  surrogate's  court  of  every  county
  having  jurisdiction of the estate of a decedent under the provisions of
  sections two hundred five and two hundred six of the  surrogate's  court
  procedure act shall have jurisdiction of proceedings under this section.
  Venue of such proceedings shall be as provided in such sections.
    (d)  Petition  for  review of a deficiency. Within ninety days, or one
  hundred fifty days if the notice is addressed to a person outside of the
  United States, after the mailing of the notice of deficiency  of  estate
  tax,  the  taxpayer  may  commence a special proceeding pursuant to this
  section in the surrogate's court for  review  of  the  deficiency.  Such
  petition  may  also assert a claim for refund of tax under this article,
  subject to the limitations of subsection  (g)  of  section  six  hundred
  eighty-seven  of  this  chapter,  as  made applicable to the tax imposed
  under this article by section nine hundred ninety.
    (e) Petition for  refund.  (1)  A  taxpayer  may  commence  a  special
  proceeding with the surrogate's court under this section for the amounts
  asserted in a claim for refund if--
    (A)  the  taxpayer  has  filed  a  timely  claim  for  refund with the
  commissioner of taxation and finance,
    (B) the taxpayer has not previously  commenced  a  special  proceeding
  under  subsection  (d)  regarding  the  tax imposed by this article with
  respect to the death of the same decedent unless the petition under this
  subsection relates to a separate claim for refund properly  filed  under
  subsection  (f)  of section six hundred eighty-seven, as made applicable
  to the tax imposed by this article by section nine hundred ninety, and
    (C) either (i) six months have expired since the claim was  filed,  or
  (ii)  the  commissioner  has  mailed  to  the taxpayer, by registered or


 certified mail, a notice of disallowance of such claim in  whole  or  in
  part.
    (2)  No  special  proceeding under this subsection shall be filed more
  than two years after the date of mailing of a  notice  of  disallowance,
  unless  prior  to  the  expiration  of  such two year period it has been
  extended by written agreement between the taxpayer and the  commissioner
  of  taxation  and  finance.  If a taxpayer files a written waiver of the
  requirement that such taxpayer be mailed a notice of  disallowance,  the
  two  year  period prescribed by this paragraph for filing a petition for
  refund shall begin on the date such waiver is filed.
    (f) Assertion of deficiency after filing petition.
    (1) Petition for review of  deficiency.  If  a  taxpayer  commences  a
  special  proceeding  for  review  of  a deficiency, the commissioner may
  assert and the surrogate's court shall have power to determine a greater
  deficiency  than  asserted  in  the  notice  of   deficiency   and   the
  commissioner  may  assert  and the surrogate's court shall have power to
  determine any addition to tax or penalty.
    (2)  Petition  for  refund.  If  the  taxpayer  commences  a   special
  proceeding  for  refund, the commissioner may assert and the surrogate's
  court may determine:
    (A) a deficiency as to any amount of deficiency  asserted  within  the
  period in which an assessment would be timely, or
    (B)  deny  so  much  of  the  amount for which refund is sought in the
  petition, as is offset by other issues pertaining to the taxpayer.
    (3) Opportunity to respond. A taxpayer shall  be  given  a  reasonable
  opportunity to respond to any matters asserted by the commissioner under
  this subsection.
    (4)  Restriction  on  further  notices  of deficiency. If the taxpayer
  commences  a  special  proceeding  under  this  section,  no  notice  of
  deficiency  of  estate  tax  may  thereafter  be  issued to the taxpayer
  regarding the tax imposed by this article with respect to the  death  of
  the  same  decedent, except in case of fraud or with respect to a change
  or correction  required  to  be  reported  under  section  nine  hundred
  seventy-nine.
    (g)  Burden  of  proof. In any case before the surrogate's court under
  this section, the burden of proof shall be upon the  petitioner,  except
  for  the following issues, as to which the burden of proof shall be upon
  the commissioner:
    (1) whether the petitioner has been guilty of  fraud  with  intent  to
  evade tax;
    (2)  whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property of
  a taxpayer, but not to show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax;
    (3) whether the petitioner is liable for any increase in a  deficiency
  where  such  increase is asserted initially after a notice of deficiency
  was mailed and a special proceeding commenced under this section, unless
  such increase in deficiency is the result  of  a  change  or  correction
  required  to be reported under section nine hundred seventy-nine, and of
  which change or correction the commissioner of taxation and finance  had
  no  notice at the time the commissioner mailed the notice of deficiency;
  and
    (4) whether any person is liable for a penalty under subsection (k) or
  (r) of  section  six  hundred  eighty-five  of  this  chapter,  as  made
  applicable  to  the  tax imposed by this article by section nine hundred
  ninety.
    (h) Review under this section exclusive. The review of a deficiency or
  denial of a refund provided by  this  section  shall  be  the  exclusive
  remedy  available  for  the  judicial  review  of  the  liability of the
  taxpayer for the taxes imposed by this article.


   (i) Appeal; assessment pending appeal; appeal bond. (1)  The  taxpayer
  or  the  commissioner  of  taxation and finance may appeal from a decree
  entered in a special proceeding pursuant to this section as provided  in
  section  two  thousand  seven  hundred  one  of  the  surrogate's  court
  procedure act.
    (2)  Irrespective of any restrictions on the assessment and collection
  of deficiencies, the commissioner may assess a deficiency determined  by
  the  surrogate's court after the expiration of the period during which a
  notice of appeal may be filed, notwithstanding that a notice  of  appeal
  has  been  filed by the taxpayer with respect to such deficiency, unless
  the taxpayer, at or before the time his notice of appeal is  filed,  has
  paid  the  deficiency, has deposited with the commissioner the amount of
  the deficiency, or has filed with  the  commissioner  a  bond  or  other
  security  acceptable  to  the commissioner (which may be a jeopardy bond
  under subsection  (h)  of  section  six  hundred  ninety-four,  as  made
  applicable  to  the  tax imposed by this article by section nine hundred
  ninety) in the amount  of  the  portion  of  the  deficiency  (including
  interest  and  other amounts) in respect of which the appeal is made and
  all costs and charges which may  accrue  against  the  taxpayer  in  the
  prosecution   of   the  proceeding,  including  costs  of  all  appeals,
  conditioned upon the payment of the deficiency (including  interest  and
  other amounts) as finally determined and such costs and charges. If as a
  result  of a waiver of the restrictions on the assessment and collection
  of a deficiency any part of the amount determined by the commissioner is
  paid after the filing of the review bond or other security, such bond or
  other security shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately
  reduced.
    (3) If the amount of a deficiency determined by  the  commissioner  is
  disallowed  in  whole  or in part by the court, the amount so disallowed
  shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer, without the making  of  a
  claim therefor, or, if payment has not been made, shall be abated.
    (j)  Date  of  finality  of  decree. A decree of the surrogate's court
  shall become final upon the expiration of the time for filing  a  notice
  of appeal if no such notice is filed within such time, or if a notice of
  appeal has been duly filed, upon expiration of the time for all judicial
  review,  or  upon  the  entry  of  a  decree of the surrogate's court in
  accordance with the mandate of the court on appeal.


   §  999.  Deposit  and  disposition  of  revenue.  All taxes, interest,
  penalties and fees collected or received by  the  tax  commission  under
  this  article  shall  be  deposited  and  disposed  of  pursuant  to the
  provisions of section one hundred seventy-one-a of this chapter.
