  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the  village
  of  Briarcliff Manor, in the county of Westchester, is hereby authorized
  and empowered to adopt and amend local laws imposing in such  village  a
  tax,  in  addition  to  any other tax authorized and imposed pursuant to
  this article, such as the legislature has or would have  the  power  and
  authority  to  impose  upon  persons  occupying any room for hire in any
  hotel. For the purposes of this section, the term "hotel" shall  mean  a
  building  or portion of it which is regularly used and kept open as such
  for the lodging of guests. The term "hotel" includes an apartment hotel,
  a motel or a boarding house, whether or not meals are served.  The  rate
  of  such  tax shall not exceed three percent of the per diem rental rate
  for each room whether such room is rented on a daily or longer basis.
    (2) Such taxes may be collected and administered by the  chief  fiscal
  officer  of  the  village  of Briarcliff Manor by such means and in such
  manner as other taxes which are now collected and administered  by  such
  officer or as otherwise may be provided by such local law.
    (3)  Such  local laws may provide that any taxes imposed shall be paid
  by the person liable therefor to the owner of the room for hire  in  the
  tourist  home,  inn, club, hotel, motel or other similar place of public
  accommodation occupied or to the person entitled to be paid the rent  or
  charge  for  the  room  for  hire in the tourist home, inn, club, hotel,
  motel or other similar place of public accommodation occupied for and on
  account of the village of Briarcliff Manor imposing  the  tax  and  that
  such  owner  or  person  entitled to be paid the rent or charge shall be
  liable for the collection and payment of the tax; and that such owner or
  person entitled to be paid the rent or charge shall have the same  right
  in  respect to collecting the tax from the person occupying the room for
  hire in the tourist home, inn, club, hotel, motel or other similar place
  of public accommodation, or in respect to nonpayment of the tax  by  the
  person  occupying  the  room  for  hire  in the tourist home, inn, club,
  hotel, motel or similar place of public accommodation, as if  the  taxes
  were  a  part  of the rent or charge and payable at the same time as the
  rent or charge; provided, however, that the chief fiscal officer of  the
  village, specified in such local laws, shall be joined as a party in any
  action  or  proceeding brought to collect the tax by the owner or by the
  person entitled to be paid the rent or charge.
    (4) Such local laws may provide for the  filing  of  returns  and  the
  payment of the taxes on a monthly basis or on the basis of any longer or
  shorter period of time.
    (5)  This  section shall not authorize the imposition of such tax upon
  any of the following:
    a. The state of New York,  or  any  public  corporation  (including  a
  public corporation created pursuant to agreement or compact with another
  state  or  the  dominion  of  Canada),  improvement  district  or  other
  political subdivision of the state;
    b. The United  States  of  America,  insofar  as  it  is  immune  from
  taxation; or
    c.  Any corporation or association, or trust, or community chest, fund
  or  foundation  organized  and  operated  exclusively   for   religious,
  charitable  or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to
  children or animals, and no part of the net earnings of which inures  to
  the  benefit of any private shareholder or individual and no substantial
  part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or  otherwise
  attempting  to influence legislation; provided, however, that nothing in
  this paragraph shall include an organization operated  for  the  primary
  purpose  of  carrying  on a trade or business for profit, whether or not


 all of its profits are payable to one or more organizations described in
  this paragraph.
    d.  A permanent resident of a hotel or motel. For the purposes of this
  section, the term "permanent  resident"  shall  mean  a  natural  person
  occupying  any  room  or  rooms  in a hotel or motel for at least thirty
  consecutive days.
    (6) Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder
  shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or  any
  other  reason  whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of
  the civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to  the
  supreme  court  within  thirty  days  after the giving of notice of such
  final determination, provided, however, that any such  proceeding  under
  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and rules shall not be
  instituted unless:
    a. The amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and
  penalties thereon as may be provided for by local  laws  or  regulations
  shall be first deposited and there shall be filed an undertaking, issued
  by  a  surety  company authorized to transact business in this state and
  approved by the superintendent of financial services of this state as to
  solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the  supreme
  court  shall  approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed
  or the tax confirmed the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which
  may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding; or
    b. At the option of the petitioner, such undertaking may be in  a  sum
  sufficient  to  cover  the  taxes, interest and penalties stated in such
  determination plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it  in
  the  prosecution  of the proceeding, in which event the petitioner shall
  not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a  condition
  precedent to the application.
    (7)  Where  any  taxes  imposed hereunder shall have been erroneously,
  illegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund
  therefor duly made to the proper fiscal officer or  officers,  and  such
  officer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,
  such  determination  shall  be  reviewable by a proceeding under article
  seventy-eight of the civil practice law and  rules,  provided,  however,
  that  such  proceeding is instituted within thirty days after the giving
  of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due  was
  not  previously  made,  and that an undertaking is filed with the proper
  fiscal officer or officers in such amount and with such  sureties  as  a
  justice  of  the  supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such
  proceeding be dismissed or the taxes confirmed, the petitioner will  pay
  all  costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  in the prosecution of such
  proceeding.
    (8) Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return  with
  intent  to  evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made
  after the expiration of more than three  years  from  the  date  of  the
  filing  of  a  return,  provided, however, that where no return has been
  filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.
    (9) All revenues resulting from the imposition of the  tax  under  the
  local  laws shall be paid into the treasury of the village of Briarcliff
  Manor and shall be credited to and deposited in the general fund of such
  village. Such revenues may be used for any lawful purpose.
    (10) Each enactment of such a local law may provide for the imposition
  of a hotel or motel tax for a period of time no longer than three  years
  from  the  date of its enactment. Nothing in this section shall prohibit
  the adoption and enactment of local laws, pursuant to the provisions  of
  this  section,  upon  the  expiration  of  any  other  local law adopted
  pursuant to this section.


   (11) If any provision of this section or the  application  thereof  to
  any  person or circumstance shall be held invalid, the remainder of this
  section and the application  of  such  provision  to  other  persons  or
  circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

  officer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,
  such  determination  shall  be  reviewable by a proceeding under article
  seventy-eight of the civil practice law and  rules,  provided,  however,
  that  such  proceeding is instituted within thirty days after the giving
  of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due  was
  not  previously  made,  and that an undertaking is filed with the proper
  fiscal officer or officers in such amount and with such  sureties  as  a
  justice  of  the  supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such
  proceeding be dismissed or the taxes confirmed, the petitioner will  pay
  all  costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  in the prosecution of such
  proceeding.
    (8) Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return  with
  intent  to  evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made

   § 1202-i. Hotel or motel taxes in Schuyler county. (1) Notwithstanding
  any  other  provision  of law to the contrary, the county of Schuyler is
  hereby authorized and empowered to adopt and amend local  laws  imposing
  in  such  county  a  tax,  in  addition  to any other tax authorized and

  "hotel" or "motel" shall mean and include any facility providing lodging
  on  an overnight basis and shall include those facilities designated and
  commonly known as "bed and breakfast" and "tourist" facilities.
    The rates of such tax shall not exceed four percent of  the  per  diem
  rental  rate for each room provided, however, that such tax shall not be
  applicable to a permanent resident of a hotel or motel. For the purposes
  of this section, the term  "permanent  resident"  shall  mean  a  person
  occupying  any  room  or  rooms  in a hotel or motel for at least thirty
  consecutive days.
    (2) Such tax may be collected and administered by the Schuyler  county

  and  in  such  manner  as  other  taxes  which  are  now  collected  and
  administered  by  such  officers or as otherwise may be provided by such
  local law.
    (3) Such local laws may provide that any tax imposed shall be paid  by
  the  person  liable  therefor  to  the  owner of the hotel or motel room
  occupied or to the person entitled to be paid the rent or charge for the
  hotel or motel room occupied  for  and  on  account  of  the  county  of
  Schuyler  imposing  the tax and that such owner or person entitled to be
  paid the rent or charge shall be liable for the collection  and  payment
  of  the  tax; and that such owner or person entitled to be paid the rent
  or charge shall have the same right in respect  to  collecting  the  tax
  from  the  person  occupying  the  hotel or motel room, or in respect to
  nonpayment of the tax by the person occupying the hotel or  motel  room,
  as  if the tax were a part of the rent or charge and payable at the same
  time as the rent or charge; provided, however, that the Schuyler  county
  treasurer,  specified  in  such local law, shall be joined as a party in
  any action or proceeding brought to collect the tax by the owner  or  by
  the person entitled to be paid the rent or charge.
    (4)  Such  local  laws  may  provide for the filing of returns and the
  payment of the tax on a monthly basis or on the basis of any  longer  or
  shorter period of time.
    (5)  This  section shall not authorize the imposition of such tax upon
  any transaction, by or with any of  the  following  in  accordance  with
  section twelve hundred thirty of this chapter:
    a.  The  state  of  New  York,  or any public corporation (including a
  public corporation created pursuant to agreement or compact with another
  state  or  the  Dominion  of  Canada),  improvement  district  or  other
  political subdivision of the state;
    b.  The  United  States  of  America,  insofar  as  it  is immune from
  taxation;
    c. Any corporation or association, or trust, or community chest,  fund
  or   foundation   organized  and  operated  exclusively  for  religious,
  charitable or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty  to
  children  or animals, and no part of the net earnings of which inures to
  the benefit of any private shareholder or individual and no  substantial
  part  of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise
  attempting to influence legislation; provided, however, that nothing  in
  this  paragraph  shall  include an organization operated for the primary
  purpose of carrying on a trade or business for profit,  whether  or  not


 all of its profits are payable to one or more organizations described in
  this paragraph.
    (6) Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder
  shall  be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any
  other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article  seventy-eight  of
  the  civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the
  supreme court within thirty days after the giving of the notice of  such
  final  determination,  provided, however, that any such proceeding under
  article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall  not  be
  instituted unless:
    a. The amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and
  penalties  thereon  as  may  be  provided for by local law or regulation
  shall be first deposited and there is filed an undertaking, issued by  a
  surety company authorized to transact business in the state and approved
  by the superintendent of financial services of this state as to solvency
  and  responsibility,  in  such  amount as a justice of the supreme court
  shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or  the
  tax  confirmed  the  petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may
  accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding; or
    b. At the option of the petitioner such undertaking may be  in  a  sum
  sufficient  to  cover the taxes, interests, and penalties stated in such
  determination plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it  in
  the  prosecution  of the proceeding, in which event the petitioner shall
  not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a  condition
  precedent to the application.
    (7)  Where  any  tax  imposed  hereunder  shall have been erroneously,
  illegally, or  unconstitutionally  collected  and  application  for  the
  refund  thereof  duly made to the proper fiscal officer or officers, and
  such officer or officers shall have made a  determination  denying  such
  refund,  such  determination  shall  be reviewable by a proceeding under
  article seventy-eight of the civil practice  law  and  rules,  provided,
  however, that such proceeding is instituted within thirty days after the
  giving  of  the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax
  due was not previously made, and that an undertaking is filed  with  the
  proper  fiscal officer or officers in such amount and with such sureties
  as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the  effect  that  if
  such  proceeding  be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will
  pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the  prosecution  of  such
  proceeding.
    (8)  Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with
  intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall  be  made
  after  the  expiration  of  more  than  three years from the date of the
  filing of a return, provided, however, that where  no  return  has  been
  filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.
    (9)  All  revenues  resulting from the imposition of the tax under the
  local laws shall be paid into the treasury of the county of Schuyler and
  shall be credited to and deposited in the general fund  of  the  county,
  thereafter to be allocated for tourist and convention development in the
  county  of  Schuyler  and  the  surrounding  tourist  region;  provided,
  however, that such local laws shall provide that  the  county  shall  be
  authorized  to retain up to a maximum of five percent of such revenue to
  defer the necessary expenses of the county in  administering  such  tax.
  The  revenue  derived  from the tax, after deducting the amount provided
  for administering such tax, as so authorized  by  local  law,  shall  be
  allocated  to enhance the general economy of the county of Schuyler, its
  cities, towns and villages, and  the  general  economy  of  the  tourist
  region in which Schuyler county is located, through promotion of tourist
  activities, conventions, track shows, special events, and other directly


 related  and supporting activities; provided, however, that a maximum of
  seventy-five percent  of  the  revenue  derived  from  the  tax  may  be
  allocated  by  the Schuyler county legislature for regional promotion of
  tourism.
    (10)  If  any  provision of this section or the application thereof to
  any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, the remainder of  this
  section  and  the  application  of  such  provision  to other persons or
  circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

  owner or person entitled to be paid the rent or charge  shall  have  the
  same  right  in  respect to collecting the tax from the person occupying
  the hotel or motel room or seasonal rental property, or  in  respect  to
  nonpayment of the tax by the person occupying the hotel or motel room or
  seasonal  rental  property,  as  if  the  tax were a part of the rent or
  charge and payable at the same time as the  rent  or  charge;  provided,
  however,  that  the Wayne county treasurer, specified in such local law,
  shall be joined as a party  in  any  action  or  proceeding  brought  to

  or   foundation   organized  and  operated  exclusively  for  religious,
  charitable or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty  to
  children  or animals, and no part of the net earnings of which inures to


 the benefit of any private shareholder or individual and no  substantial
  part  of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise
  attempting to influence legislation; provided, however, that nothing  in
  this  paragraph  shall  include an organization operated for the primary
  purpose of carrying on a trade or business for profit,  whether  or  not
  all of its profits are payable to one or more organizations described in
  this paragraph.
    (6) Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder
  shall  be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any
  other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article  seventy-eight  of
  the  civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the
  supreme court within thirty days after the giving of the notice of  such
  final  determination,  provided, however, that any such proceeding under
  article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall  not  be
  instituted unless:
    a. The amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and
  penalties  thereon  as  may  be  provided for by local law or regulation
  shall be first deposited and there is filed an undertaking, issued by  a
  surety company authorized to transact business in the state and approved
  by the superintendent of financial services of this state as to solvency
  and  responsibility,  in  such  amount as a justice of the supreme court
  shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or  the
  tax  confirmed  the  petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may
  accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding; or
    b. At the option of the petitioner such undertaking may be  in  a  sum
  sufficient  to  cover the taxes, interests, and penalties stated in such
  determination plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it  in
  the  prosecution  of the proceeding, in which event the petitioner shall
  not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a  condition
  precedent to the application.

  illegally, or  unconstitutionally  collected  and  application  for  the
  refund  thereof  duly made to the proper fiscal officer or officers, and
  such officer or officers shall have made a  determination  denying  such
  refund,  such  determination  shall  be reviewable by a proceeding under
  article seventy-eight of the civil practice  law  and  rules,  provided,
  however, that such proceeding is instituted within thirty days after the
  giving  of  the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax
  due was not previously made, and that an undertaking is filed  with  the
  proper  fiscal officer or officers in such amount and with such sureties
  as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the  effect  that  if
  such  proceeding  be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will
  pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the  prosecution  of  such
  proceeding.
    (8)  Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with
  intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall  be  made
  after  the  expiration  of  more  than  three years from the date of the
  filing of a return, provided, however, that where  no  return  has  been
  filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.
    (9)  All  revenues  resulting from the imposition of the tax under the
  local laws shall be paid into the treasury of the county  of  Wayne  and
  shall  be  credited  to and deposited in the general fund of the county,
  thereafter to be allocated for tourist and convention development in the
  county of Wayne and the surrounding tourist region;  provided,  however,
  that  such  local laws shall provide that the county shall be authorized
  to retain up to a maximum of five percent of such revenue to  defer  the
  necessary  expenses of the county in administering such tax. The revenue
  derived  from  the  tax,  after  deducting  the  amount   provided   for


 administering  such  tax,  as  so  authorized  by  local  law,  shall be
  appropriated annually by the county legislature  upon  adoption  of  the
  budget  for  the  county  of Wayne to enhance the general economy of the
  county  of  Wayne, its city, towns and villages, and the general economy
  of the tourist region in which the county of Wayne is  located,  through
  the  promotion  of  regional  tourism,  tourist activities, conventions,
  trade shows, special events,  tourist  attractions  and  other  directly
  related and supporting activities.
    (10)  If  any  provision of this section or the application thereof to

  section.  Such  reasonable cost of administration shall be determined by
  the board of representatives of Otsego county.

  of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due  was
  not  previously  made,  and that an undertaking is filed with the proper
  fiscal officer or officers in such amount and with such  sureties  as  a
  justice  of  the  supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such

  hotel  or motel room occupied for and on account of the county of Seneca
  imposing the tax and that such owner or person entitled to be  paid  the
  rent  or  charge  shall  be liable for the collection and payment of the
  tax; and that such owner or person entitled  to  be  paid  the  rent  or
  charge  shall  have the same right in respect to collecting the tax from
  the person  occupying  the  hotel  or  motel  room,  or  in  respect  to
  nonpayment  of  the tax by the person occupying the hotel or motel room,
  as if the tax were a part of the rent or charge and payable at the  same
  time  as  the  rent or charge; provided, however, that the Seneca county

  attempting  to influence legislation; provided, however, that nothing in

  sufficient  to  cover the taxes, interests, and penalties stated in such
  determination plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it  in
  the  prosecution  of the proceeding, in which event the petitioner shall
  not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a  condition
  precedent to the application.
    (7)  Where  any  tax  imposed  hereunder  shall have been erroneously,
  illegally, or  unconstitutionally  collected  and  application  for  the
  refund  thereof  duly made to the proper fiscal officer or officers, and
  such officer or officers shall have made a  determination  denying  such
  refund,  such  determination  shall  be reviewable by a proceeding under

  maintain public parks  and  recreational  facilities;  to  maintain  and

  designated by the Seneca county board of supervisors. No more than  five
  percent of such revenues shall be used for the cost of administering the
  provisions  of  this  subdivision  within  the Seneca county treasurer's
  office.

  supreme court within thirty days after the giving of the notice of  such
  final  determination,  provided, however, that any such proceeding under

  not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a  condition
  precedent to the application.

  illegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund
  thereof duly made to the proper fiscal officer  or  officers,  and  such
  officer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,
  such  determination  shall  be  reviewable by a proceeding under article

  intent  to  evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made

  filing  of  a  return,  provided, however, that where no return has been
  filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.

  the county shall be authorized to retain five percent revenue from  such
  tax   to  defer  the  necessary  expenses  incurred  by  the  county  in
  administering such tax; provided, further the county  is  authorized  to
  use  all  or  part  of  the  money  in  the special fund to pay a single
  not-for-profit corporation, pursuant to a contract with the  county,  to
  do  tourism promotion and convention development in the county. "Tourist
  promotion and convention development" is defined  as  costs  related  to

  not be applicable to a permanent resident of a hotel or motel.  For  the
  purposes  of  this  section  the  term "permanent resident" shall mean a
  person occupying any room or rooms in a hotel  or  motel  for  at  least
  thirty  consecutive  days.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this
  section, any city in the county of Niagara imposing hotel or motel taxes
  pursuant to the authority of this subpart shall have the prior right  to
  impose such taxes in such city, up to the maximum rate of tax authorized
  for  such  city  in  this  subpart; and the rate of tax authorized to be
  imposed by the county pursuant to the authority of this section  in  any
  such  city  imposing  such  a  tax  shall be reduced by the rate of such
  city's tax.
    (ii) Provided further that, any such city tax, to the extent  that  it
  would  require  a reduction in the county's tax rate imposed pursuant to
  this section in  such  city,  shall  not  become  effective  before  the
  commencement  of  the county's next succeeding fiscal year and then only
  if the city shall have given notice to such county of its imposition  of
  such  tax  at  least six months prior to the commencement of such fiscal
  year, provided, however, that the local legislative body of such  county
  may  waive  the  requirement  of  such  notice  and  postponement of the
  effective date of such city tax.
    (2) Such tax may be collected and administered by the county treasurer
  or other fiscal officers of Niagara county by such  means  and  in  such
  manner  as  other taxes which are now collected and administered by such
  officers or as otherwise may be provided by such local law.
    (3) Such local laws may provide that any tax imposed shall be paid  by
  the  person  liable  therefor  to  the  owner of the hotel or motel room
  occupied or to the person entitled to be paid the rent or charge for the
  hotel or motel room occupied for and on account of the county of Niagara
  imposing the tax and that such owner or person entitled to be  paid  the
  rent  or  charge  shall  be liable for the collection and payment of the
  tax; and that such owner or person entitled  to  be  paid  the  rent  or
  charge  shall  have the same right in respect to collecting the tax from
  the person  occupying  the  hotel  or  motel  room,  or  in  respect  to
  non-payment  of the tax by the person occupying the hotel or motel room,
  as if the tax were a part of the rent or charge and payable at the  same
  time as the rent or charge; provided, however, that the county treasurer
  or  other  fiscal  officers  of the county, specified in such local law,
  shall be joined as a party  in  any  action  or  proceeding  brought  to
  collect  the  tax  by the owner or by the person entitled to be paid the
  rent or charge.
    (4) Such local laws may provide for the  filing  of  returns  and  the
  payment  of  the tax on a monthly basis or on the basis of any longer or
  shorter period of time.


   (5) This section shall not authorize the imposition of such  tax  upon
  any  transaction,  by  or  with  any of the following in accordance with
  section twelve hundred thirty of this article:
    a.  The  state  of  New  York,  or any public corporation (including a
  public corporation created pursuant to agreement or compact with another
  state  or  the  Dominion  of  Canada),  improvement  district  or  other
  political subdivision of the state;
    b.  The  United  States  of  America,  insofar  as  it  is immune from
  taxation;
    c. Any corporation or association, or trust, or community chest,  fund
  or   foundation   organized  and  operated  exclusively  for  religious,
  charitable or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty  to
  children  or animals, and no part of the net earnings of which inures to
  the benefit of any private shareholder or individual and no  substantial
  part  of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise
  attempting to influence legislation; provided, however, that nothing  in
  this  paragraph  shall  include an organization operated for the primary
  purpose of carrying on a trade or business for profit,  whether  or  not
  all of its profits are payable to one or more organizations described in
  this paragraph.
    (6) Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder
  shall  be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any
  other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article  seventy-eight  of
  the  civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the
  supreme court within thirty days after the giving of the notice of  such
  final  determination,  provided, however, that any such proceeding under
  article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall  not  be
  instituted unless:
    a. The amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and
  penalties  thereon  as  may  be  provided for by local law or regulation
  shall be first deposited and there is filed an undertaking, issued by  a
  surety  company  authorized  to  transact  business  in  this  state and
  approved by the superintendent of financial services of this state as to
  solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the  supreme
  court  shall  approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed
  or the tax confirmed the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which
  may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding; or
    b. At the option of the petitioner such undertaking may be  in  a  sum
  sufficient  to  cover  the taxes, interests and penalties stated in such
  determination plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it  in
  the  prosecution  of the proceeding, in which event the petitioner shall
  not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a  condition
  precedent to the application.
    (7)  Where  any  tax  imposed  hereunder  shall have been erroneously,
  illegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund
  thereof duly made to the proper fiscal officer  or  officers,  and  such
  officer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,
  such  determination  shall  be  reviewable by a proceeding under article
  seventy-eight of the civil practice law and  rules,  provided,  however,
  that  such  proceeding is instituted within thirty days after the giving
  of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due  was
  not  previously  made,  and that an undertaking is filed with the proper
  fiscal officer or officers in such amount and with such  sureties  as  a
  justice  of  the  supreme  court  shall  approve the effect that if such
  proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the  petitioner  will  pay
  all  costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  in the prosecution of such
  proceeding.


   (8) Except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent  return  with
  intent  to  evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made
  after the expiration of more than three  years  from  the  date  of  the
  filing  of  a  return,  provided, however, that where no return has been
  filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.
    (9)  All  revenues  resulting from the imposition of the tax under the
  local law shall be paid into the treasury of Niagara county and shall be
  credited to and deposited as follows: (a) the first four percentum  (4%)
  shall  be  deposited  in the general fund of the county thereafter to be
  allocated and paid to a not-for-profit corporation under  contract  with
  the  county  for  the  promotion  of  tourism in the county; and (b) the
  additional one percentum (1%) of such revenue from  this  tax  shall  be
  dedicated  to  the  operation of the Discover Niagara shuttle. Provided,
  however, that such local law shall provide  that  the  county  shall  be
  authorized  to retain up to a maximum of five percent of such revenue to
  defer the necessary expenses of the county in administering such tax.
    (10) Each enactment of a local law may provide for the imposition of a
  hotel or motel tax for a period of time no longer than three years  from
  the  date  of  its enactment. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the
  adoption and enactment of local laws, pursuant to the provisions of this
  section, upon the expiration of any other local law adopted pursuant  to
  this section.
    (11)  If  any  provision of this section or the application thereof to
  any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, the remainder of  this
  section  and  the  application  of  such  provision  to other persons or
  circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

  officer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,
  such determination shall be reviewable by  a  proceeding  under  article
  seventy-eight  of  the  civil practice law and rules, provided, however,
  that such proceeding is instituted within thirty days after  the  giving

  pursuant to this section.
    (11) If any provision of this section or the  application  thereof  to

  shall  be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any
  other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article  seventy-eight  of
  the  civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the
  supreme court within thirty days after the giving of the notice of  such
  final  determination,  provided, however, that any such proceeding under
  article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall  not  be
  instituted unless:
    a. The amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and
  penalties  thereon  as  may  be provided for by local law or regulation,
  shall be first deposited and there is filed an undertaking, issued by  a
  surety  company  authorized  to  transmit  business  in  this  state and
  approved by the superintendent of financial services of this state as to
  solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the  supreme
  court  shall  approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed
  or the tax confirmed the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which
  may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding; or
    b. At the option of the petitioner such undertaking may be  in  a  sum

  not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a  condition
  precedent to the application.
    (8)  Where  any  tax  imposed  hereunder  shall have been erroneously,
  illegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund
  thereof duly made to the proper fiscal officer  or  officers,  and  such
  officer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,
  such  determination  shall  be  reviewable by a proceeding under article
  seventy-eight of the civil practice law and  rules,  provided,  however,
  that  such  proceeding is instituted within thirty days after the giving
  of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due  was
  not  previously  made,  and that an undertaking is filed with the proper
  fiscal officer or officers in such amount and with such  sureties  as  a
  justice  of  the  supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such
  proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the  petitioner  will  pay
  all  costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  in the prosecution of such
  proceeding.
    (9) Except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent  return  with
  intent  to  evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made
  after the expiration of more than three  years  from  the  date  of  the

  filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.
    (10) All revenues resulting from the imposition of the tax  authorized

  the county shall be authorized to retain five percent revenue from  such
  tax   to  defer  the  necessary  expenses  incurred  by  the  county  in
  administering such tax; provided, further the county  is  authorized  to
  use  all  or  part  of  the  money  in  the special fund to pay a single
  not-for-profit corporation, pursuant to a contract with the  county,  to
  do  tourism promotion and convention development in the county. "Tourist
  promotion and convention development" is defined  as  costs  related  to


 advertising  the county, retaining of staff to promote tourism and other
  tourism or convention costs recommended by said staff.
    (11)  If  any  provision of this section or the application thereof to

  the  person  liable  therefor  to  the  owner of the hotel or motel room
  occupied or to the person entitled to be paid the rent or charge for the
  hotel or motel room occupied for and on account of the county of Genesee
  imposing the tax and that such owner or person entitled to be  paid  the
  rent  or  charge  shall  be liable for the collection and payment of the
  tax; and that such owner or person entitled  to  be  paid  the  rent  or
  charge  shall  have the same right in respect to collecting the tax from
  the person  occupying  the  hotel  or  motel  room,  or  in  respect  to
  nonpayment  of  the tax by the person occupying the hotel or motel room,
  as if the tax were a part of the rent or charge and payable at the  same
  time as the rent or charge; provided, however, that the county treasurer
  or  other  fiscal  officers  of the county, specified in such local law,
  shall be joined as a party  in  any  action  or  proceeding  brought  to
  collect  the  tax  by the owner or by the person entitled to be paid the

  part  of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise
  attempting to influence legislation; provided, however, that nothing  in
  this  paragraph  shall  include an organization operated for the primary


 purpose of carrying on a trade or business for profit,  whether  or  not
  all of its profits are payable to one or more organizations described in
  this paragraph.
    (7) Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder
  shall  be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any
  other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article  seventy-eight  of
  the  civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the
  supreme court within thirty days after the giving of the notice of  such
  final  determination,  provided, however, that any such proceeding under

  not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a  condition
  precedent to the application.
    (8)  Where  any  tax  imposed  hereunder  shall have been erroneously,
  illegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund
  thereof duly made to the proper fiscal officer  or  officers,  and  such
  officer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,
  such  determination  shall  be  reviewable by a proceeding under article
  seventy-eight of the civil practice law and  rules,  provided,  however,
  that  such  proceeding is instituted within thirty days after the giving
  of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due  was
  not  previously  made,  and that an undertaking is filed with the proper
  fiscal officer or officers in such amount and with such  sureties  as  a
  justice  of  the  supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such
  proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the  petitioner  will  pay
  all  costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  in the prosecution of such

  intent  to  evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made
  after the expiration of more than three  years  from  the  date  of  the

    (2) Such tax may be collected and administered by the county treasurer
  or other fiscal officers of Niagara county by such  means  and  in  such

  time as the rent or charge; provided, however, that the county treasurer
  or  other  fiscal  officers  of the county, specified in such local law,
  shall be joined as a party  in  any  action  or  proceeding  brought  to
  collect  the  tax  by the owner or by the person entitled to be paid the

  as  if the tax were a part of the rent or charge and payable at the same
  time as the rent or charge; provided, however, that the county treasurer

  approved by the superintendent of financial services of this state as to
  solvency  and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the supreme
  court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding  be  dismissed
  or the tax confirmed the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which
  may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding; or
    b.  At  the  option of the petitioner such undertaking may be in a sum
  sufficient to cover the taxes, interests and penalties  stated  in  such
  determination  plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in
  the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the  petitioner  shall
  not  be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a condition
  precedent to the application.
    (7) Where any tax imposed pursuant to this  section  shall  have  been
  erroneously,  illegally  or unconstitutionally collected and application
  for the refund thereof  duly  made  to  the  proper  fiscal  officer  or
  officers,  and  such officer or officers shall have made a determination
  denying such  refund,  such  determination  shall  be  reviewable  by  a
  proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and

  filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.
    (9)  All  revenues  resulting from the imposition of the tax under the
  local law shall be paid into the treasury of Orleans county and shall be
  credited to and deposited in the general fund of the  county.  Provided,
  however,  that  such  local  law  shall provide that the county shall be
  authorized to retain up to a maximum of five percent of such revenue  to
  defer the necessary expenses of the county in administering such tax.
    (10) Each enactment of a local law may provide for the imposition of a
  hotel  or motel tax for a period of time no longer than three years from
  the date of its enactment. Nothing in this section  shall  prohibit  the
  adoption and enactment of local laws, pursuant to the provisions of this
  section,  upon the expiration of any other local law adopted pursuant to
  this section.
    (11) If any provision of this section or the  application  thereof  to

  the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the  petitioner  shall
  not  be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a condition
  precedent to the application.
    (7) Where any tax  imposed  hereunder  shall  have  been  erroneously,
  illegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund
  thereof  duly  made  to  the proper fiscal officer or officers, and such
  officer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,

  seventy-eight  of  the  civil practice law and rules, provided, however,
  that such proceeding is instituted within thirty days after  the  giving

  local laws shall be paid into the treasury  of  Cattaraugus  county  and
  shall  be  credited  to and deposited in the general fund of the county,
  thereafter to be allocated at the discretion of the  county  legislature
  of  the  county  of Cattaraugus for the purposes of tourism and economic


 development; provided, however, that such local laws shall provide  that
  the county shall be authorized to retain up to a maximum of five percent
  of  such  revenue  to  defer  the  necessary  expenses  of the county in
  administering  such  tax.  The  revenue  derived  from  the  tax,  after
  deducting  the  amount  provided  for  administering  such  tax,  as  so
  authorized  by  local  law,  shall  be  allocated to enhance the general
  economy of Cattaraugus county, its cities, towns, and villages,  through
  promotion  of  tourist  activities,  conventions,  trade  shows, special
  events, and other directly related and supporting activities.
    (10) Each enactment of such a local law may provide for the imposition
  of a hotel or motel tax for a period of time no longer than three  years
  from  the  date of its enactment. Nothing in this section shall prohibit

  not  be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a condition
  precedent to the application.

  charge  shall  have the same right in respect to collecting the tax from
  the person  occupying  the  hotel  or  motel  room,  or  in  respect  to
  nonpayment  of  the tax by the person occupying the hotel or motel room,
  as if the tax were a part of the rent or charge and payable at the  same
  time as the rent or charge; provided, however, that the county treasurer
  or  other  fiscal  officers  of the county, specified in such local law,
  shall be joined as a party  in  any  action  or  proceeding  brought  to

  supreme court within thirty days after the giving of the notice of  such
  final  determination,  provided, however, that any such proceeding under

  shall be first deposited and there is filed an undertaking, issued by  a
  surety  company  authorized  to  transact  business  in  this  state and
  approved by the superintendent of financial services of this state as to
  solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the  supreme
  court  shall  approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed
  or the tax confirmed the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which
  may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding; or
    b. At the option of the petitioner such undertaking may be  in  a  sum
  sufficient  to  cover  the taxes, interests and penalties stated in such
  determination plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it  in
  the  prosecution  of the proceeding, in which event the petitioner shall
  not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a  condition
  precedent to the application.
    (7)  Where  any  tax  imposed  hereunder  shall have been erroneously,
  illegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund
  thereof duly made to the proper fiscal officer  or  officers,  and  such
  officer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,
  such  determination  shall  be  reviewable by a proceeding under article
  seventy-eight of the civil practice law and  rules,  provided,  however,
  that  such  proceeding is instituted within thirty days after the giving
  of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due  was
  not  previously  made,  and that an undertaking is filed with the proper
  fiscal officer or officers in such amount and with such  sureties  as  a

  however,  that  such local laws shall provide that: (a) the county shall
  be authorized and shall  dedicate  fifty  percent  of  such  revenue  to
  promote tourism in the county; and (b) the county shall be authorized to
  retain  up  to  a  maximum  of  ten percent of such revenue to defer the
  necessary expenses of the county in administering such tax. The  revenue
  derived  from  the  tax, after deducting the amount provided for tourism
  and the administration of such tax, as so authorized by local law, shall
  be allocated to enhance the general economy of Yates county,  its  towns
  and villages.
    (10)  If  any  provision of this section or the application thereof to
  any person or circumstance shall be held invalid, the remainder of  this


 section  and  the  application  of  such  provision  to other persons or
  circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

  time as the rent or charge; provided, however, that the county treasurer
  or other fiscal officers of the county, specified  in  such  local  law,

  erroneously,  illegally  or unconstitutionally collected and application
  for the refund thereof  duly  made  to  the  proper  fiscal  officer  or
  officers,  and  such officer or officers shall have made a determination
  denying such  refund,  such  determination  shall  be  reviewable  by  a
  proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
  rules, provided, however, that  such  proceeding  is  instituted  within
  thirty  days after the giving of the notice of such denial, that a final

  illegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund
  thereof duly made to the proper fiscal officer  or  officers,  and  such
  officer or officers shall have made a determination denying such refund,

  seventy-eight of the civil practice law and  rules,  provided,  however,
  that  such  proceeding is instituted within thirty days after the giving
  of the notice of such denial, that a final determination of tax due  was
  not  previously  made,  and that an undertaking is filed with the proper
  fiscal officer or officers in such amount and with such  sureties  as  a
  justice  of  the  supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such
  proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the  petitioner  will  pay
  all  costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  in the prosecution of such
  proceeding.

  attendance for the last preceding school year of pupils residing in each
  such district and without regard to the location of the school attended.

  paragraph  of  this  section,  as  long as such rate is one of the rates
  authorized by such paragraph or such sale or use may  be  exempted  from
  such  taxes.  Provided,  however, such lower rate must apply to all such
  energy sources and services and at the same rate and no  such  exemption
  may  be enacted unless such exemption applies to all such energy sources
  and services. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply  to  a
  sale  or use of diesel motor fuel which involves a delivery at a filling
  station or into a repository which is equipped  with  a  hose  or  other
  apparatus  by  which  such fuel can be dispensed into the fuel tank of a
  motor vehicle.
    (ii) The transitional provisions in subdivision (c) of section  eleven
  hundred  five-A  shall  apply  to  a  change  in rate or to an exemption
  adopted pursuant to the authority of this paragraph in the  same  manner
  and to the same extent as applicable under section eleven hundred five-A
  except  that  equivalent  dates  shall be substituted to accord with the

  section to the contrary, any local law, ordinance or resolution, enacted
  pursuant  to the authority of this paragraph, (A) may be made applicable

  registered mail to the state tax commission at its office in  Albany  at
  least  thirty  days prior to such effective date and (C) may exempt from

  Any reference in  this  chapter  or  in  any  local  law,  ordinance  or
  resolution  enacted  pursuant to the authority of this article to former
  subdivisions (n) or (p)  of  this  section  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a
  reference  to  clauses  (xii) or (xiii) of this paragraph, respectively,
  and any such local  law,  ordinance  or  resolution  that  provides  the
  exemptions  provided in such former subdivisions (n) and/or (p) shall be
  deemed instead to provide  the  exemptions  provided  in  clauses  (xii)
  and/or (xiii) of this paragraph.
    (b)  (1)  Or,  one or more of the taxes described in subdivisions (b),
  (d), (e) and (f) of section eleven hundred five of this chapter, at  the
  same  uniform  rate,  including  the  transitional provisions in section
  eleven hundred six of this chapter covering  such  taxes,  but  not  the
  taxes  described  in  subdivisions (a) and (c) of section eleven hundred
  five of this chapter. Provided, further, that where the tax described in
  subdivision (b) of section  eleven  hundred  five  of  this  chapter  is
  imposed,  the  compensating  use taxes described in clauses (E), (G) and
  (H) of subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred  ten  of  this  chapter
  shall also be imposed. Provided, further, that where the taxes described
  in  subdivision  (b)  of section eleven hundred five of this chapter are
  imposed, such taxes shall omit: (A) the provision for refund  or  credit
  contained  in subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred nineteen of this
  chapter with respect to such taxes described in such subdivision (b)  of
  section eleven hundred five unless such city or county elects to provide
  such  provision  or,  if  so  elected, to repeal such provision; (B) the
  exemption provided in paragraph  two  of  subdivision  (ee)  of  section
  eleven hundred fifteen of this chapter unless such county or city elects
  otherwise;  (C)  the  exemption provided in paragraph two of subdivision
  (ii) of section eleven hundred fifteen  of  this  chapter,  unless  such
  county  or  city  elects  otherwise;  and  (D) the exemption provided in
  paragraph two of subdivision (kk) of section eleven hundred  fifteen  of
  this  chapter, unless such county or city elects otherwise; and provided
  further that where the tax described in subdivision (f) of such  section
  eleven  hundred five is imposed, such tax shall not apply to charges for
  admission to race tracks and simulcast facilities.
    (2) In respect to the taxes described in such subdivisions  (b),  (d),
  (e)  and  (f) of section eleven hundred five of this chapter and in such
  clauses (E), (G) and (H) of subdivision (a) of  section  eleven  hundred
  ten  of  this  chapter  and  the transitional provisions in such section
  eleven hundred six covering those taxes, all provisions of a  local  law
  imposing  any  such  tax,  except  as  to  rate  and except as otherwise
  provided herein, shall be identical with the corresponding provisions in
  such article twenty-eight of this chapter, including the definition  and
  exemption  provisions  of such article, so far as the provisions of such
  article twenty-eight of this chapter can be made applicable to the taxes
  imposed by such city or county and with  such  limitations  and  special
  provisions as are set forth in this article; provided, however, that any
  local law enacted by any city of one million or more, imposing the taxes
  authorized  by  this  subdivision,  shall omit the exemption provided in
  subdivision (c) of section eleven hundred fifteen of  this  chapter  and
  may  omit  the exception provided in paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) of
  section eleven hundred five of this chapter for charges to a patron  for
  admission  to,  or  use  of, facilities for sporting activities in which


 such patron is to be a participant, such as bowling alleys and  swimming
  pools.  The  transitional  provisions  contained  in  subdivision (d) of
  section eleven hundred six of this  chapter  shall  apply  in  the  same
  manner and to the same extent to a tax imposed by omitting the exception
  in  paragraph  (1)  of subdivision (f) of section eleven hundred five of
  this chapter, as described in the preceding  sentence,  except  that  an
  equivalent  date  shall  be substituted to accord with the date when the
  tax so imposed becomes effective. The tax described in any one  of  such
  subdivisions  (b),  (d),  (e)  and (f) of section eleven hundred five of
  this chapter, including the  related  transitional  provisions  in  such
  section  eleven  hundred six of this chapter, and the taxes described in
  clauses (E), (G) and (H) of subdivision (a) of  section  eleven  hundred
  ten  of  this chapter where the tax described in such subdivision (b) of
  section eleven hundred five of this  chapter  is  imposed,  may  not  be
  imposed  by  a  city  or  county  unless  the  local  law,  ordinance or
  resolution imposes such tax so as to include all portions and all  types
  of  receipts, charges or rents, as the case may be, subject to state tax
  under the applicable subdivision of section eleven hundred five of  this
  chapter  and  uses  subject  to  tax  under the applicable provisions of
  section eleven hundred ten of this chapter where the  tax  described  in
  subdivision  (b)  of  section  eleven  hundred  five  of this chapter is
  imposed.
    (3) (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary but
  not with respect to cities subject to the provisions of  section  eleven
  hundred  eight  of  this  chapter,  any  city or county, except a county
  wholly contained within a  city,  may  provide  that  the  tax  imposed,
  pursuant  to this subdivision, by such city or county on the sale, other
  than for resale, of propane (except when sold in containers of less than
  one hundred pounds), natural gas, electricity, steam and  gas,  electric
  and  steam services of whatever nature used for residential purposes and
  on the use of gas or electricity used for residential  purposes  may  be
  imposed  at a lower rate than the uniform local rate imposed pursuant to
  the opening paragraph of this section, as long as such rate  is  one  of
  the  rates  authorized  by  such  paragraph  or  such sale or use may be
  exempted from such taxes. Provided, however, such lower rate must  apply
  to all such energy sources and services and at the same rate and no such
  exemption,  other than the exemption provided for in subdivision (ee) of
  section eleven hundred fifteen of this chapter,  if  such  exemption  is
  elected  by  such  city  or county, may be enacted unless such exemption
  applies to all such energy sources and services.
    (ii) The transitional provisions in subdivision (c) of section  eleven
  hundred  five-A  shall  apply  to  a  change  in rate or to an exemption
  adopted pursuant to the authority of this paragraph in the  same  manner
  and to the same extent as applicable under section eleven hundred five-A
  except  that  equivalent  dates  shall be substituted to accord with the
  date when the rate or exemption adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall
  become effective. The provisions in subdivisions (d) and (e) of  section
  eleven  hundred five-A shall apply so far as such provisions can be made
  applicable under this paragraph.
    (iii) Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  (d)  of  this
  section  to the contrary, any local law, ordinance or resolution enacted
  pursuant to the authority of this paragraph, (A) may be made  applicable
  to  the  quarterly period ending February twenty-ninth, nineteen hundred
  eighty if a certified copy of  such  law,  ordinance  or  resolution  is
  mailed  by  registered mail to the state tax commission at its office in
  Albany on or before November twentieth, nineteen  hundred  seventy-nine,
  (B)  may  go into effect on January first, nineteen hundred eighty, if a
  certified copy of  such  law,  ordinance  or  resolution  is  mailed  by


 registered  mail  to the state tax commission at its office in Albany at
  least thirty days prior to such effective date and (C) may  exempt  from
  tax,  effective  October  first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty;  the energy
  sources and services described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.
    (4)  Notwithstanding  any provision of this article to the contrary, a
  county, city or school district which, pursuant to the authority of this
  article, imposes the tax described in subdivision (b) of section  eleven
  hundred  five  of  this  chapter  without also imposing all of the other
  taxes described  in  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section  shall  not  be
  authorized  to impose the sales tax on prepaid telephone calling service
  described in subparagraph (D) of paragraph one  of  subdivision  (b)  of
  such  section  eleven hundred five or the compensating use tax described
  in clause (G) of subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred ten  of  this
  chapter;  and any reference in this article to the tax described in such
  subdivision (b) of section eleven hundred five and any reference in this
  article to the tax described in such clause (G) of  subdivision  (a)  of
  section  eleven hundred ten shall be deemed not to include the sales tax
  on prepaid  telephone  calling  service  or  the  compensating  use  tax
  described  in  such  clause  (G)  of  subdivision  (a) of section eleven
  hundred ten, in cases where the tax described in subdivision (b) of such
  section eleven hundred five is imposed  by  a  county,  city  or  school
  district  which does not also impose all of the other taxes described in
  subdivision (a) of this section.
    (c) Notwithstanding the prior provisions of this section, where a city
  has, pursuant to section twelve hundred  twenty-four  of  this  article,
  pre-empted   the   right  to  impose  any  of  the  taxes  described  in
  subdivisions (b), (d), (e) and (f) of section  eleven  hundred  five  of
  this  chapter  by  imposing one or more of such taxes, and, if the taxes
  described in such subdivision (b) of section eleven hundred five of this
  chapter are imposed, the compensating use  taxes  described  in  clauses
  (E),  (G)  and  (H)  of subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred ten of
  this chapter, as provided for in subdivision (b) of  this  section,  the
  county  in  which  such  city  is  located  may still impose those taxes
  authorized under subdivision (a) or (b) of this section  not  pre-empted
  by  such city. Within areas in such county but outside of such city, the
  county shall continue to be authorized and empowered to impose the taxes
  as authorized in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section,  without  any
  diminution  in  the county's right to impose such taxes in areas outside
  such city.
    (d) A local law, ordinance or resolution imposing any tax pursuant  to
  this  section,  increasing or decreasing the rate of such tax, repealing
  or suspending such tax, exempting from such tax the energy  sources  and
  services   described  in  paragraph  three  of  subdivision  (a)  or  of
  subdivision (b) of this section or changing the rate of tax  imposed  on
  such  energy  sources and services or providing for the credit or refund
  described in clause six of subdivision (a)  of  section  eleven  hundred
  nineteen  of  this  chapter,  or electing or repealing the exemption for
  residential solar equipment  and  electricity  in  subdivision  (ee)  of
  section  eleven  hundred  fifteen  of this article, or the exemption for
  commercial solar  equipment  and  electricity  in  subdivision  (ii)  of
  section eleven hundred fifteen of this article, or electing or repealing
  the  exemption  for  commercial fuel cell electricity generating systems
  equipment and electricity generated by  such  equipment  in  subdivision
  (kk)  of  section  eleven  hundred  fifteen of this article must go into
  effect only on one of the following  dates:  March  first,  June  first,
  September first or December first; provided, that a local law, ordinance
  or  resolution providing for the exemption described in paragraph thirty
  of subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred fifteen of this chapter  or


 repealing  any  such  exemption  or a local law, ordinance or resolution
  providing for a refund or credit described in subdivision (d) of section
  eleven hundred nineteen of this chapter or repealing such  provision  so
  provided  must  go  into  effect only on March first. No such local law,
  ordinance or resolution shall be effective unless a  certified  copy  of
  such  law,  ordinance or resolution is mailed by registered or certified
  mail to the commissioner at the commissioner's office in Albany at least
  ninety days prior to the date it is to become  effective.  However,  the
  commissioner  may  waive  and  reduce  such  ninety-day  minimum  notice
  requirement to a  mailing  of  such  certified  copy  by  registered  or
  certified  mail  within  a  period of not less than thirty days prior to
  such effective  date  if  the  commissioner  deems  such  action  to  be
  consistent  with  the commissioner's duties under section twelve hundred
  fifty of this article and the commissioner acts by resolution. Where the
  restriction provided for in section twelve hundred twenty-three of  this
  article  as  to  the  effective date of a tax and the notice requirement
  provided for therein are  applicable  and  have  not  been  waived,  the
  restriction   and   notice   requirement   in   section  twelve  hundred
  twenty-three of this article shall also apply.
    (e) Certified  copies  of  any  local  law,  ordinance  or  resolution
  described  in  subdivision  (d) of this section shall also be filed with
  the city  or  county  clerk,  the  secretary  of  state  and  the  state
  comptroller  within  five  days  after the date it is enacted. Certified
  copies of any other local law, ordinance or resolution enacted  pursuant
  to  this  section shall be filed with the state tax commission, the city
  or county clerk, the secretary of state and the state comptroller within
  five days after the date it is enacted.
    (f) On the first day of the first month following the month in which a
  municipal assistance corporation is created under  article  ten  of  the
  public  authorities  law,  any taxes imposed pursuant to this section by
  the city in aid of which such corporation was  created  and,  except  as
  hereinafter  provided  for  in subdivisions (h) and (j) of this section,
  the power of such city to adopt and  amend  local  laws,  ordinances  or
  resolutions  imposing  taxes  pursuant  to the authority of such section
  shall, notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, be
  suspended until the later of July first, two thousand eight, or the last
  day of the month in which all the notes  and  bonds  of  such  municipal
  assistance  corporation  shall  have  been  fully  paid  and  discharged
  together with interest thereon and interest on  unpaid  installments  of
  interest.
    (g)   All  of  the  enabling  act  provisions,  which  authorized  the
  imposition of the taxes suspended pursuant to this  section,  the  local
  laws,  ordinances,  and resolutions imposing such taxes, any regulations
  promulgated with respect to such taxes, including  the  provisions  with
  respect  to assessment, payment, determination, collection and refund of
  such taxes, requirements for filing returns, preservation of records and
  disposition of revenue shall continue in  full  force  and  effect  with
  respect  to  all  such  taxes  accrued  up to the effective date of such
  suspension.
    (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (f) of this section,
  any city having a population of one million or more in which a municipal
  assistance corporation is  created  under  article  ten  of  the  public
  authorities  law  shall continue to be authorized and empowered to adopt
  and amend local laws, imposing taxes, at  a  rate  not  to  exceed  four
  percent  on  the  receipts  of  sales  from  the services of laundering,
  dry-cleaning, tailoring, weaving,  pressing,  shoe  repairing  and  shoe
  shining, and charges to a patron for admission to, or use of, facilities
  for sporting activities in which such patron is to be a participant such


 as  bowling alleys and swimming pools. Such taxes shall be administered,
  collected and distributed by the state tax  commission  as  provided  in
  subpart B of part III and in part IV of this article.
    (i)  On  the first day of the first month following the month in which
  the taxes provided for in section eleven hundred seven of  this  chapter
  are  terminated,  the suspension provided for in subdivision (f) of this
  section shall terminate and the sales and compensating use taxes imposed
  by a city having a population of one million or more  immediately  prior
  to  the  effective  date  of the suspension shall go into full force and
  effect, provided that the resumed taxes,  and  any  local  law  imposing
  those  taxes,  shall  incorporate amendments to this article and article
  twenty-eight of this chapter so that the resumed taxes  are,  except  as
  otherwise  provided  by  law,  identical  to  the taxes authorized to be
  imposed by the city.
    (j) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (f) of this section,
  the city of Troy shall continue to be authorized and empowered to  adopt
  and  amend local laws, ordinances or resolutions imposing taxes pursuant
  to the authority  of  this  section  during  the  period  that  (i)  the
  municipal  assistance  corporation  for  the  city of Troy created under
  article ten of the public authorities law  is  in  existence,  and  (ii)
  pursuant  to section two of chapter one hundred eighty-seven of the laws
  of nineteen hundred ninety-five, as it may be amended, the tax described
  in section eleven hundred eight of this chapter is not imposed  in  such
  city.
    (m)  Taxes  imposed  on native American nation or tribe lands. Where a
  non-native American person purchases, for such person's own consumption,
  any retail sale item on native American nation or tribe land  recognized
  by the federal government and reservation land recognized as such by the
  state   of  New  York,  the  commissioner  shall  promulgate  rules  and
  regulations necessary to implement the collection of sales,  excise  and
  use taxes on such retail sale items.
    (o)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  state  or  local law,
  ordinance or resolution to the contrary: any city having a population of
  one million or more in which the taxes imposed by section eleven hundred
  seven  of  this  chapter  are  in  effect,  acting  through  its   local
  legislative  body, is hereby authorized and empowered to elect to exempt

  section, by enacting a local law or resolution in the form prescribed by
  the commissioner pursuant to section twelve hundred fifty-seven of  this
  article;  whereupon, upon compliance with the provisions of subdivisions
  (d) and (e) of this  section,  such  enactment  of  such  local  law  or
  resolution  shall be deemed to be an amendment to section eleven hundred
  seven of this chapter and such section eleven  hundred  seven  shall  be
  deemed  to  incorporate such exemption of or reduced rate on such energy
  sources and services as if  it  had  been  duly  enacted  by  the  state
  legislature and approved by the governor.


   §  1210-A.  Sales and compensating use tax for purposes of the Suffolk
  county drinking water protection program.  (a) In addition to the  taxes
  imposed  by  section  twelve  hundred ten or any other provision of this
  article, the county of Suffolk is hereby  authorized  and  empowered  to
  adopt and amend a local law, ordinance or resolution imposing within the
  territorial  limits  of said county an additional sales and compensating
  use tax at the rate  of  one-quarter  of  one  percent  for  the  period
  beginning  December  first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-four  and  ending
  November thirtieth, two thousand sixty, which tax shall be identical  to
  the tax imposed by said county pursuant to section twelve hundred ten of
  this  article.  Except  as  hereinafter provided, all provisions of this
  article, including the  definition  and  exemption  provisions  and  the
  provisions  relating  to the administration, collection and distribution
  by the commissioner, shall apply for purposes of the tax imposed by this
  section in the same manner and with the same force and effect as if  the
  language  of  this article had been incorporated in full in this section
  and had expressly referred to the tax imposed by this section; provided,
  however, that  any  provision  relating  to  a  maximum  rate  shall  be
  calculated  without  reference  to the additional sales and compensating
  use tax herein authorized. For purposes of  part  IV  of  this  article,
  relating  to  the disposition of revenues resulting from taxes collected
  and  administered  by  the  commissioner,  the  additional   sales   and
  compensating use tax herein provided shall be deemed to be imposed under
  the  authority  of  section  twelve  hundred ten of this article and all
  provisions relating to the deposit, administration  and  disposition  of
  taxes,  penalties  and  interest  relating  to a tax imposed by a county
  under the authority of section twelve hundred ten of this article shall,
  except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, apply to  the
  additional  sales  and  compensating  use  tax  imposed pursuant to this
  section.
    (b) Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  article  to  the
  contrary,   the  net  collections  from  the  tax  imposed  pursuant  to
  subdivision (a) of this section for the period beginning December first,
  nineteen hundred eighty-four and  ending  November  thirtieth,  nineteen
  hundred  eighty-eight  shall, upon payment to the county of Suffolk, and
  moneys due said fund pursuant  to  subdivisions  (c)  and  (d)  of  this
  section,  be  deposited  in  a  special  fund,  to  be  designated as an

  such  fund  shall  be  deposited  in  one  or more of the banks or trust

  appropriated  from and transferred to or expended in any fiscal year for
  the purposes of making payments pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c)  of
  this  section,  may  alternatively  be  appropriated for the purposes of
  paying debt service on any new indebtedness incurred after the effective
  date of the chapter of the laws of two thousand one  that  enacted  this
  paragraph  pursuant  to the local finance law in order to effectuate the

  the taxes authorized to be imposed by this section;  provided,  however,
  that  any  provision of this article relating to a maximum rate shall be

  which rate shall be uniform for all portions and all types  of  receipts
  and uses subject to such taxes. In respect to such taxes, all provisions
  of  the  resolution  imposing  them,  except  as  to  rate and except as
  otherwise provided herein, shall be  identical  with  the  corresponding
  provisions  in  such article twenty-eight of this chapter, including the
  applicable definition and exemption provisions of such article,  so  far
  as  the  provisions  of such article twenty-eight of this chapter can be
  made applicable to the taxes imposed by such school  district  and  with
  such  limitations  and  special  provisions  as  are  set  forth in this
  article. The taxes  described  in  subdivision  (b)  of  section  eleven
  hundred  five  (but  excluding  the  tax  on  prepaid  telephone calling
  service) and clauses (E) and (H) of subdivision (a)  of  section  eleven
  hundred  ten, including the transitional provision in subdivision (b) of
  such section eleven hundred six of this chapter, may not be  imposed  by
  such  school  district unless the resolution imposes such taxes so as to
  include all portions and all types of receipts and uses subject  to  tax
  under  such  subdivision  (but  excluding  the  tax on prepaid telephone
  calling service) and clauses.  Provided, however, that, where  a  school
  district  imposes  such  taxes,  such taxes shall omit the provision for
  refund or credit contained in subdivision (d) of section eleven  hundred
  nineteen  of  this  chapter with respect to such taxes described in such
  subdivision (b) of  section  eleven  hundred  five  unless  such  school
  district  elects  to provide such provision or, if so elected, to repeal
  such provision, and shall omit the exemptions provided in paragraph  two
  of  subdivision  (ee)  and  paragraph two of subdivision (ii) of section
  eleven hundred fifteen of  this  chapter  unless  such  school  district
  elects otherwise, and shall omit the exemption provided in paragraph two
  of  subdivision  (kk)  of section eleven hundred fifteen of this chapter
  unless such school district elects otherwise.
    (b) A tax so imposed shall be in addition to any tax which a county or
  city may impose or may be imposing pursuant to this article or any other
  law, and may be so imposed notwithstanding any  inconsistent  provisions
  of  this article or of any other law and notwithstanding that the county
  or city may impose or may be imposing the taxes  authorized  by  section
  twelve hundred ten at the maximum rate authorized therefor.
    (c)  No  such  action  to  impose  the  taxes or provide or repeal the
  exemptions authorized by subdivision (a) of this section shall be  taken
  by  a  school  district until after the school authorities thereof shall
  have held a public hearing thereon, after notice  given  in  the  manner
  required  by  law  for the giving of notice of the annual meeting of the
  school district, except that if it be a city school district such notice


 shall be given in the manner required by law for a public hearing on its
  tentative budget.
    (d) All actions taken by majority votes of school authorities pursuant
  to this section shall be deemed resolutions under this article and shall
  be official records of the school district in which they are taken.
    (e)  A  resolution imposing a tax pursuant to this section, increasing
  or decreasing the rate of such tax, or repealing or suspending such  tax
  must  go  into  effect  only on one of the following dates: March first,
  June  first,  September  first  or  December  first;  provided,  that  a
  resolution  providing  for the refund or credit described in subdivision
  (d) of section eleven hundred nineteen of this chapter or repealing such
  provision must go into effect only on March first.  No  such  resolution
  shall  be effective unless a certified copy of such resolution is mailed
  by  registered  or  certified  mail   to   the   commissioner   at   the
  commissioner's  office  in Albany at least ninety days prior to the date
  it is to become effective.  However,  the  commissioner  may  waive  and
  reduce  such  ninety-day minimum notice requirement to a mailing of such
  certified copy by registered or certified mail within a  period  of  not
  less  than  thirty days prior to such effective date if the commissioner
  deems such action to be consistent with the commissioner's duties  under
  section  twelve  hundred fifty of this article and the commissioner acts
  by resolution.
    (f) Certified copies of any resolution described in subdivision (e) of
  this section shall also be filed with the state department of education,
  the secretary of state and the state comptroller within five days  after
  the date it is enacted. Certified copies of any other resolution enacted
  pursuant to this section shall be filed with the commissioner, the state
  department   of   education,  the  secretary  of  state  and  the  state

   §  1212-A. Certain taxes of cities of one million or more administered
  by commissioner of taxation and finance.--(a) Any  city  in  this  state
  having  a  population  of  one million or more, acting through its local
  legislative body, is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt and  amend
  local  laws  imposing in any such city: (1) a tax on receipts from every
  sale of the service of providing parking, garaging or storing for  motor
  vehicles  by  persons  operating  a garage (other than a garage which is
  part of premises  occupied  solely  as  a  private  one  or  two  family
  dwelling),  parking  lot or other place of business engaged in providing
  parking, garaging or storing for motor vehicles, in  any  county  within
  such  city with a population density in excess of fifty thousand persons
  per square mile, at the rate of eight per centum, on receipts from every
  sale of such services, except receipts from the sale of such services to
  an individual resident of such county when such services are rendered on
  a monthly or  longer-term  basis  at  the  principal  location  for  the
  parking,  garaging  or  storing  of a motor vehicle owned or leased (but
  only in the case of a lease for a term of one  year  or  more)  by  such
  individual  resident.  The population of a county shall be determined by
  reference to the latest federal census.
    (i) For purposes of the  tax  authorized  by  paragraph  one  of  this
  subdivision, the following terms shall mean:
    (A)  "Individual  resident."  A  natural  person  who maintains in the
  county in which such tax is authorized to be imposed a  permanent  place
  of abode which is such person's primary residence.
    (B)  "Motor  vehicle." A motor vehicle which is registered pursuant to
  the vehicle and traffic law at the  address  of  the  primary  residence
  referred  to  in clause (A) of this subparagraph, or which is registered
  pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law  and  leased  to  an  individual
  resident  at  the address of the primary residence referred to in clause
  (A) of this subparagraph, and which is  not  used  in  carrying  on  any
  trade, business or commercial activity.
    (C)  A  "lease  for  a term of one year or more" shall not include any
  lease the term of which is less than one year, irrespective of the  fact
  that  the cumulative period for which such lease may be in effect is one
  year or more as the result of the right to exercise an option  to  renew
  or other like provision.
    (ii)  Notwithstanding  any other provision of law to the contrary, for
  purposes of implementing the exemption of individual residents from  the
  tax  authorized  by  this  paragraph,  the  commissioner of taxation and
  finance shall, subject to such terms and conditions as it  may  consider
  necessary,  delegate to the commissioner of finance of any city imposing
  such tax the power and authority to develop  and  administer  reasonable
  and  necessary  procedures,  including the use of exemption certificates
  for presentation to vendors, for determining  entitlement  to  exemption
  from  such  tax,  and  to  prescribe,  subject  to  the  approval of the
  commissioner of taxation and finance, rules  and  regulations  necessary
  and appropriate in carrying out such responsibilities.
    (iii)  Any  person  who,  in violation of any provision of law enacted
  pursuant to the authorization contained in this paragraph or any rule or
  regulation promulgated thereunder, obtains  or  uses  a  certificate  of
  exemption  relating  to  the  exemption  from the tax authorized by this
  paragraph, shall, if such violation was due to negligence or intentional
  disregard of such provision or rule or regulation (but without intent to
  defraud), be liable for a penalty of not more than one  hundred  dollars
  for  each  such  violation,  and, if such violation was due to fraud, be
  liable for a penalty of not more than five hundred dollars for each such
  violation. The commissioner of finance of any  city  imposing  such  tax
  shall  have the power, in his discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise


 any penalty imposed pursuant to this paragraph. The penalties authorized
  by this subparagraph shall be in addition to  any  penalty  provided  by
  section eleven hundred forty-five of this chapter, and shall be paid and
  disposed  of,  and,  if unpaid, shall be determined, assessed, collected
  and enforced,  in  the  same  manner  as  the  tax  authorized  by  this
  paragraph.
    (iv)   Notwithstanding   this   paragraph,   section   eleven  hundred
  thirty-nine of this chapter  or  any  other  provision  of  law  to  the
  contrary,  an  individual  resident shall not be entitled to a refund or
  credit with respect to any amount of additional tax which was paid to  a
  vendor  prior  to  the  date  such  individual resident presented to the
  vendor a valid certificate of exemption from such tax.
    (2) a tax, at the same uniform rate, but at a rate not to exceed  four
  and  one-half per centum, in multiples of one-half of one per centum, on
  the  receipts  from  every  sale  of  the  following  services:  beauty,
  barbering, hair restoring, manicuring, pedicuring, electrolysis, massage
  services  and  similar  services,  and  every sale of services by weight
  control salons, health salons, gymnasiums, turkish and  sauna  bath  and
  similar  establishments and every charge for the use of such facilities,
  whether  or  not  any  tangible  personal  property  is  transferred  in
  conjunction  therewith;  but excluding services rendered by a physician,
  osteopath, dentist, nurse,  physiotherapist,  chiropractor,  podiatrist,
  optometrist,   ophthalmic  dispenser  or  a  person  performing  similar
  services licensed under title VIII of the education law, as amended, and
  excluding such services when performed on pets and other animals.
    (3) a tax, at the same uniform rate, but at a rate not to exceed  four
  and  one-half per centum, in multiples of one-half of one per centum, on
  the receipts from every sale of any or all of the following services  in
  whole or in part: credit rating, credit reporting, credit adjustment and
  collection  services,  including,  but  not  limited  to, those services
  provided by mercantile and consumer credit rating or  reporting  bureaus
  or  agencies  and  credit  adjustment or collection bureaus or agencies,
  whether rendered in written or oral form or in any other manner,  except
  to  the  extent  otherwise  taxable  under  article twenty-eight of this
  chapter; notwithstanding the foregoing, collection  services  shall  not
  include those services performed by a law office or a law and collection
  office,  the maintenance or conduct of which constitutes the practice of
  law, if the services are performed by an attorney at law  who  has  been
  duly  licensed and admitted to practice law in this state. The local law
  imposing  the  taxes  authorized  by  this  paragraph  may  provide  for
  exclusions  and  exemptions  in  addition  to those provided for in such
  paragraph. Provided, however, that the tax hereby authorized  shall  not
  be imposed after November thirtieth, two thousand twenty-six.
    (b)  (1)  All  provisions  set  forth  in article twenty-eight of this
  chapter applicable to the taxes imposed  under  section  eleven  hundred
  five, including the definition and exemption provisions of such article,
  shall  apply  in  respect  to  a  tax  imposed  under  the  authority of
  subdivision (a) of this  section,  except  as  to  rate  and  except  as
  otherwise  provided  herein.  A  sale of tangible personal property to a
  person for use by him in performing a service subject to the tax imposed
  under the authority of paragraph two or three of subdivision (a) of this
  section shall not be deemed a purchase for resale for  purposes  of  the
  taxes  imposed  by  article twenty-eight or pursuant to the authority of
  this article.
    (2) However, with respect to a tax  imposed  under  the  authority  of
  paragraph  three  of  subdivision (a) of this section a refund or credit
  equal to the amount of the sale  or  compensating  use  tax  imposed  by
  section eleven hundred seven of this chapter and paid on the sale or use


 of  tangible  personal property which is later used by such purchaser in
  performing a service subject  to  tax  under  such  paragraph  shall  be
  allowed  such  purchaser  against  the  tax  imposed  pursuant  to  such
  paragraph  and  collected  by such person on the sale of such service if
  such property has become a physical component part of the property  upon
  which  the service is performed or has been transferred to the purchaser
  of the service in  conjunction  with  the  performance  of  the  service
  subject to tax.
    (3)  Any  tax  imposed  under the authority of subdivision (a) of this
  section shall be paid  with  respect  to  receipts  from  all  sales  of
  services on or after the effective date of such tax although rendered or
  agreed to be rendered under a prior contract. Where a service is sold on
  a  monthly,  quarterly,  yearly or other term basis, the charge for such
  service shall be subject to the tax imposed pursuant to the authority of
  such subdivision to the extent that such charge  is  applicable  to  any
  period  on or after the date such tax becomes effective, and such charge
  shall be apportioned on the basis of the ratio of  the  number  of  days
  falling  within such period to the total number of days in the full term
  or period.
    (4) Wages, salaries and other compensation paid by an employer  to  an
  employee  for  performing  as  an  employee  the  services  described in
  subdivision (a) of this section are not receipts subject  to  the  taxes
  imposed under such subdivision.
    (5)  All  taxes  imposed  pursuant  to subdivision (a) of this section
  shall be administered and collected by the commissioner, as provided  in
  subpart  B  of part III, and shall be distributed by the commissioner as
  provided in part IV of this article.
    (c) A tax so imposed pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be in  addition
  to  any other tax which a city may impose or may be imposing pursuant to
  this article or any other law, and may be so imposed notwithstanding any
  inconsistent provisions  of  this  article  or  of  any  other  law  and
  notwithstanding  that  the  city may impose or may be imposing the taxes
  authorized by section twelve hundred ten at the maximum rate  authorized
  therefor.
    (d) A local law imposing a tax pursuant to this section, increasing or
  decreasing  the  rate  of  such tax, or repealing or suspending such tax
  must go into effect only on one of the  following  dates:  March  first,
  June  first,  September first or December first. No such local law shall
  be effective unless a certified copy of such  local  law  is  mailed  by
  registered  or  certified mail to the commissioner at the commissioner's
  office in Albany at least ninety days prior to the date it is to  become
  effective.   However,   the  commissioner  may  waive  and  reduce  such
  ninety-day minimum notice requirement to a  mailing  of  such  certified
  copy  by  registered  or certified mail within a period of not less than
  thirty days prior to such effective date if the commissioner deems  such
  action  to  be  consistent  with the commissioner's duties under section
  twelve hundred fifty of  this  article  and  the  commissioner  acts  by
  resolution.
    (e)  Certified copies of any local law described in subdivision (d) of
  this section shall also be filed with the city clerk, the  secretary  of
  state  and  the  state comptroller within five days after the date it is
  enacted. Certified copies of any other local  law  enacted  pursuant  to
  this  section  shall be filed with the commissioner, the city clerk, the
  secretary of state and the state comptroller within five days after  the
  date it is enacted.

  purposes  of  stabilizing  property  taxes  and  either  paying  certain
  judgments,   compromises  or  settlements  or  paying  debt  service  on
  obligations of said county issued to pay said judgments, compromises  or
  settlements.    (a)  In  addition to the taxes imposed by section twelve
  hundred ten or any other  provision  of  this  article,  the  county  of
  Suffolk  is  hereby  authorized and empowered to adopt and amend a local
  law, ordinance or resolution imposing within the territorial  limits  of
  said  county an additional sales and compensating use tax at the rate of
  one-quarter of one percent for  the  period  beginning  December  first,
  nineteen   hundred  ninety-seven  and  ending  November  thirtieth,  two
  thousand seventeen, which tax shall be identical to the tax  imposed  by
  said  county  pursuant  to  section  twelve hundred ten of this article.
  Except  as  hereinafter  provided,  all  provisions  of  this   article,
  including  the  definition  and  exemption provisions and the provisions
  relating to the  administration,  collection  and  distribution  by  the

  section in the same manner and with the same force and effect as if  the
  language  of  this article had been incorporated in full in this section
  and had expressly referred to the tax imposed by this section; provided,
  however, that  any  provision  relating  to  a  maximum  rate  shall  be
  calculated  without  reference  to the additional sales and compensating
  use  tax  herein  authorized.  For  purposes  of  part  IV  of   article
  twenty-nine  of  this  chapter,  relating to the disposition of revenues
  resulting from taxes collected and administered by the commissioner, the
  additional sales and compensating  use  tax  herein  provided  shall  be

  of  this  article  and  all  provisions   relating   to   the   deposit,
  administration and disposition of taxes, penalties and interest relating
  to  a  tax  imposed  by  a  county under the authority of section twelve
  hundred ten of this article  shall,  except  as  otherwise  specifically
  provided in this section, apply to the additional sales and compensating
  use tax imposed pursuant to this section.
    (b)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  article  to the
  contrary,  the  net  collections  from  the  tax  imposed  pursuant   to

  be  designated  as  the  LILCO tax certiorari payment and securitization
  fund to be created by said county therefor separate and apart  from  any
  other  funds  and  accounts of the county.  Moneys in such fund shall be
  deposited and secured in the manner  provided  by  section  ten  of  the
  general  municipal  law.    Pending  expenditure  from such fund, moneys
  therein may be invested in the manner provided in section eleven of  the
  general  municipal  law. Any interest earned or capital gain realized on
  the moneys so deposited or invested shall accrue to and become  part  of
  such  fund. Moneys in said fund may be appropriated from and transferred
  to or expended in any fiscal year only for the purpose of either  paying
  a  tax certiorari judgment, or compromise or settlement thereof, payable
  by said county in a proceeding entitled In the Matter of the Application

  OF BROOKHAVEN, SHOREHAM WADING RIVER  PUBLIC  LIBRARY  DISTRICT,  WADING
  RIVER  FIRE  DISTRICT,  WADING  RIVER LIGHTING DISTRICT (the "the "PILOT
  payment judgment"), or paying the principal, interest  and  premium,  if
  any,  on  bonds  or  bond  anticipation  notes hereinafter issued by the
  county of Suffolk to pay any such LILCO phase 2 judgment, PILOT  payment
  judgment   or  compromise  or  settlement  thereof,  or  any  other  tax
  certiorari judgment  against  or  compromise  or  settlement  of  a  tax

  Suffolk county shall have either paid or provided for the payment of all
  such judgments or compromises or settlements in full or paid or provided
  for  the  payment of the principal, interest and premium, if any, on all

  article   or  any  other  provision  of  this  article,  the  county  of
  Schenectady is hereby authorized and empowered  to  adopt  and  amend  a
  local  law,  ordinance  or  resolution  imposing  within the territorial

  twelve hundred ten of this article. Except as hereinafter provided,  all
  provisions  of  this  article,  including  the  definition and exemption
  provisions and the provisions relating to the administration, collection
  and distribution by the commissioner, shall apply for  purposes  of  the
  taxes  authorized  to  be imposed by this section in the same manner and
  with the same force and effect as if the language of  this  article  had
  been  incorporated in full in this section and had expressly referred to
  the taxes authorized to be imposed by this section;  provided,  however,
  that  any  provision of this article relating to a maximum rate shall be
  calculated without reference to the additional rate authorized  by  this
  section.  For  purposes  of  part  IV  of  this article, relating to the
  disposition of revenues resulting from taxes collected and  administered
  by  the  commissioner,  the  additional sales and compensating use taxes
  authorized by this section shall be  deemed  to  be  imposed  under  the

  additional  sales  and  compensating  use  tax  imposed  pursuant to the
  authority of this section.
    (b) Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  article  to  the
  contrary,   the  net  collections  from  the  tax  imposed  pursuant  to

  such  fund  to  be designated as a special dedicated support fund, to be
  created by said county therefor separate and apart from any other  funds
  and  accounts  of  the  county.  Pending  deposit  from such Schenectady
  metroplex development authority support fund into the  general  fund  of

  moneys so deposited or invested shall accrue to and become part of  such
  Schenectady metroplex development authority support fund.
    (c)  If  the county of Schenectady does not impose the one-half of one
  percent rate of taxes authorized by  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section

  ninety-eight and ending August thirty-first, two thousand  thirty-eight,

  sales  and  compensating  use  tax  and  deposited  in  the  Schenectady

  deposit in the authority's general fund.  The  authority  may  use  such
  portion  of  such  dedicated  net  collections  received  for any lawful
  purpose or power of the authority. On January  first,  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-nine,  and  then quarterly thereafter, the director of finance of
  Schenectady county, after  transferring  seventy  percent  of  such  net
  collections  to  the  authority  for  deposit in the authority's general
  fund, shall transfer all remaining monies in the  Schenectady  metroplex

  seven and ending November thirtieth,  two  thousand  twenty-five,  which
  taxes shall be identical to the taxes imposed by such county pursuant to
  the  authority  of section twelve hundred ten of this subpart. Except as
  hereinafter provided, all provisions  of  this  article,  including  the
  definition  and  exemption provisions and the provisions relating to the
  administration, collection and distribution by the  commissioner,  shall
  apply  for  purposes of the taxes authorized by this section in the same
  manner and with the same force and effect as if  the  language  of  this
  article  had been incorporated in full in this section and had expressly
  referred to the taxes authorized by  this  section;  provided,  however,
  that  any  provision  relating  to  a  maximum  rate shall be calculated
  without reference to the rate of additional sales and  compensating  use
  taxes  herein  authorized.  For  purposes  of  part  IV of this article,
  relating to the disposition of revenues resulting from  taxes  collected
  and   administered   by  the  commissioner,  the  additional  sales  and
  compensating use taxes authorized by  this  section  imposed  under  the
  authority  of  section  twelve  hundred  ten  of  this  subpart  and all
  provisions relating to the deposit, administration  and  disposition  of
  taxes,  penalties  and  interest  relating  to taxes imposed by a county
  under the authority of section twelve hundred ten of this subpart shall,
  except as otherwise provided in this section, apply  to  the  additional
  sales and compensating use taxes authorized by this section.




   §  1210-F.  Sales and compensating use tax for purposes of the Suffolk
  county water quality restoration fund. (a)  In  addition  to  the  taxes
  imposed  by section twelve hundred ten, section twelve hundred ten-A, or
  any other provision of this article, the county  of  Suffolk  is  hereby
  authorized  and  empowered  to adopt and amend a local law, ordinance or
  resolution, subject to a mandatory referendum, in  accordance  with  the
  provisions  set forth in section twenty-three of the municipal home rule
  law, imposing within the territorial limits of said county an additional
  sales and compensating use tax at the rate of one-eighth of one  percent
  for  the  period  beginning  March  first,  two thousand twenty-four and
  ending February twenty-ninth, two thousand sixty,  which  tax  shall  be
  identical  to  the tax imposed by said county pursuant to section twelve
  hundred ten of this article. Provided, however,  that  such  local  law,
  ordinance  or  resolution  shall  not  take  effect  unless  such county
  complies with the provisions of subdivisions  (d)  and  (e)  of  section
  twelve   hundred  ten  of  this  subpart  and  provides  notice  to  the
  commissioner in accordance with the provisions  of  subdivision  (d)  of
  such  section of the approval of such resolution by the electors. Except
  as hereinafter provided, all provisions of this article,  including  the
  definition  and  exemption provisions and the provisions relating to the
  administration, collection and distribution by the  commissioner,  shall
  apply for purposes of the tax imposed by this section in the same manner
  and  with  the  same force and effect as if the language of this article
  had been incorporated in full in this section and had expressly referred
  to the  tax  imposed  by  this  section;  provided,  however,  that  any
  provision  relating  to  a  maximum  rate  shall  be  calculated without
  reference to the  additional  sales  and  compensating  use  tax  herein
  authorized.  For  purposes  of  part IV of this article, relating to the
  disposition of revenues resulting from taxes collected and  administered
  by  the  commissioner,  the  additional  sales  and compensating use tax
  herein provided shall be deemed to be imposed  under  the  authority  of
  section  twelve  hundred ten of this article and all provisions relating
  to the deposit, administration and disposition of taxes,  penalties  and
  interest  relating  to  a tax imposed by a county under the authority of
  section twelve hundred ten of this article shall,  except  as  otherwise
  specifically provided in this section, apply to the additional sales and
  compensating use tax imposed pursuant to this section.
    (b)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  article  to the
  contrary,  the  net  collections  from  the  tax  imposed  pursuant   to
  subdivision  (a)  of  this section for the period beginning March first,
  two thousand twenty-four and ending February twenty-ninth, two  thousand
  sixty  shall,  upon  payment to the county of Suffolk, be deposited in a
  special fund, to be designated as the water quality restoration fund  to
  be  created  by  said  county therefor separate and apart from any other
  funds and accounts of the county. Moneys in such fund shall be deposited
  and secured in the  manner  provided  by  section  ten  of  the  general
  municipal  law  and in no event shall moneys deposited be transferred to
  any other account. In addition to the  net  collections  from  the  tax,
  deposits  into  the  fund  may  include  revenues of Suffolk county from
  whatever source  and  may  include  the  acceptance  of  gifts.  Pending
  expenditure from such fund, moneys therein may be invested in the manner
  provided  in  section  eleven of the general municipal law. Any interest
  earned or capital gain realized on the moneys so deposited  or  invested
  shall accrue to and become part of such fund. Moneys in said fund may be
  appropriated from and transferred to or expended in any fiscal year only
  for the purposes authorized by subdivision eleven of section two hundred
  fifty-six-b of the county law.




   §  1211.  Taxes of certain cities and school districts administered by
  state tax commission. (a) On request by a majority  vote  of  the  whole
  number  of  the  school  authorities of the school district or districts
  which are coterminous with, partly within or wholly within a city having
  a population of less than one hundred twenty-five thousand, such city is
  hereby authorized and empowered to adopt and amend local  laws  imposing
  for  school  district purposes the taxes authorized under section twelve
  hundred ten, at the rate of one-half, one, one and  one-half,  two,  two
  and  one-half or three percent which rate shall be uniform for all taxes
  imposed pursuant to the authority of this  section;  provided,  however,
  where  a  city imposes a tax under the authority of both sections twelve
  hundred ten and twelve hundred eleven, the aggregate rate of  the  taxes
  imposed pursuant to both sections cannot exceed three percent.
    (b) A local law imposing such a tax shall be effective only during the
  period  that  each  of  the  school  districts  partly within and partly
  without such city, by a majority vote of the whole number of its  school
  authorities,  shall  impose  an identical tax, at the same uniform rate,
  within that part of its territorial limits outside of  such  city.  Such
  school  authorities  are  hereby authorized and empowered to impose such
  tax so as to be effective only during the period when the tax imposed by
  the city  on  areas  of  school  districts  within  the  city  shall  be
  effective.  Taxes so imposed by such a city and by such school districts
  shall be administered and collected  by  the  state  tax  commission  as
  provided in subpart B of part III of this article.
    (c) All actions taken by majority votes of school authorities pursuant
  to this section shall be deemed resolutions under this article and shall
  be official records of the school districts in which they are taken.
    (d)  A  local  law  or  resolution  imposing  any tax pursuant to this
  section, increasing or decreasing the rate of  such  tax,  repealing  or
  suspending  such  tax or providing for the credit or refund described in
  clause six of subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred nineteen of this
  chapter must go into effect only on one of the  following  dates:  March
  first, June first, September first or December first, subject to further
  requirement as to effective date provided for in subdivision (b) of this
  section; provided, that a local law or resolution providing for a refund
  or  credit  described  in  subdivision  (d)  of  section  eleven hundred
  nineteen of this chapter or repealing such provision so provided must go
  into effect only on March first, subject to further  requirement  as  to
  effective  date provided for in subdivision (b) of this section. No such
  local law or resolution shall be effective unless a  certified  copy  of
  such  local  law or resolution is mailed by registered or certified mail
  to the commissioner at the commissioner's  office  in  Albany  at  least
  ninety  days  prior  to the date it is to become effective. However, the
  commissioner  may  waive  and  reduce  such  ninety-day  minimum  notice
  requirement  to  a  mailing  of  such  certified  copy  by registered or
  certified mail within a period of not less than  thirty  days  prior  to
  such  effective  date  if  the  commissioner  deems  such  action  to be
  consistent with the commissioner's duties under section  twelve  hundred
  fifty of this article and the commissioner acts by resolution. Where the
  restriction  provided for in section twelve hundred twenty-three of this
  article as to the effective date of a tax  and  the  notice  requirement
  provided  for  therein  are  applicable  and  have  not been waived, the
  restriction  and  notice   requirement   in   section   twelve   hundred
  twenty-three of this article shall also apply.
    (e)  Certified  copies  of  any  local  law or resolution described in
  subdivision (d) of this section shall also be filed with the city clerk,
  state department of education, the secretary  of  state  and  the  state
  comptroller  within  five  days  after the date it is enacted. Certified


 copies of any other local law or resolution  enacted  pursuant  to  this
  section  shall  be  filed with the state tax commission, the city clerk,
  the state department of education, the secretary of state and the  state
  comptroller within five days after the date it is enacted.




   §   1212.   Certain   taxes   of   school  districts  administered  by
  commissioner.  (a) Any school district which is coterminous with, partly
  within or wholly within a city having a  population  of  less  than  one
  hundred  twenty-five  thousand,  is  hereby authorized and empowered, by
  majority vote of the whole number of its school authorities,  to  impose
  for  school  district  purposes,  within  the territorial limits of such
  school  district  and  without  discrimination  between  residents   and
  nonresidents  thereof, the taxes described in subdivision (b) of section
  eleven hundred five (but excluding the tax on prepaid telephone  calling
  services)  and the taxes described in clauses (E) and (H) of subdivision
  (a) of section eleven hundred ten, including the transitional provisions
  in subdivision (b) of section eleven hundred six of this chapter, so far
  as such provisions can be made applicable to the taxes imposed  by  such
  school  district and with such limitations and special provisions as are
  set forth in this article, such taxes to  be  imposed  at  the  rate  of
  one-half,  one, one and one-half, two, two and one-half or three percent
  which rate shall be uniform for all portions and all types  of  receipts
  and uses subject to such taxes. In respect to such taxes, all provisions
  of  the  resolution  imposing  them,  except  as  to  rate and except as
  otherwise provided herein, shall be  identical  with  the  corresponding
  provisions  in  such article twenty-eight of this chapter, including the
  applicable definition and exemption provisions of such article,  so  far
  as  the  provisions  of such article twenty-eight of this chapter can be
  made applicable to the taxes imposed by such school  district  and  with
  such  limitations  and  special  provisions  as  are  set  forth in this
  article. The taxes  described  in  subdivision  (b)  of  section  eleven
  hundred  five  (but  excluding  the  tax  on  prepaid  telephone calling
  service) and clauses (E) and (H) of subdivision (a)  of  section  eleven
  hundred  ten, including the transitional provision in subdivision (b) of
  such section eleven hundred six of this chapter, may not be  imposed  by
  such  school  district unless the resolution imposes such taxes so as to
  include all portions and all types of receipts and uses subject  to  tax
  under  such  subdivision  (but  excluding  the  tax on prepaid telephone
  calling service) and clauses.  Provided, however, that, where  a  school
  district  imposes  such  taxes,  such taxes shall omit the provision for
  refund or credit contained in subdivision (d) of section eleven  hundred
  nineteen  of  this  chapter with respect to such taxes described in such
  subdivision (b) of  section  eleven  hundred  five  unless  such  school
  district  elects  to provide such provision or, if so elected, to repeal
  such provision, and shall omit the exemptions provided in paragraph  two
  of  subdivision  (ee)  and  paragraph two of subdivision (ii) of section
  eleven hundred fifteen of  this  chapter  unless  such  school  district
  elects otherwise, and shall omit the exemption provided in paragraph two
  of  subdivision  (kk)  of section eleven hundred fifteen of this chapter
  unless such school district elects otherwise.
    (b) A tax so imposed shall be in addition to any tax which a county or
  city may impose or may be imposing pursuant to this article or any other
  law, and may be so imposed notwithstanding any  inconsistent  provisions
  of  this article or of any other law and notwithstanding that the county
  or city may impose or may be imposing the taxes  authorized  by  section
  twelve hundred ten at the maximum rate authorized therefor.
    (c)  No  such  action  to  impose  the  taxes or provide or repeal the
  exemptions authorized by subdivision (a) of this section shall be  taken
  by  a  school  district until after the school authorities thereof shall
  have held a public hearing thereon, after notice  given  in  the  manner
  required  by  law  for the giving of notice of the annual meeting of the
  school district, except that if it be a city school district such notice


 shall be given in the manner required by law for a public hearing on its
  tentative budget.
    (d) All actions taken by majority votes of school authorities pursuant
  to this section shall be deemed resolutions under this article and shall
  be official records of the school district in which they are taken.
    (e)  A  resolution imposing a tax pursuant to this section, increasing
  or decreasing the rate of such tax, or repealing or suspending such  tax
  must  go  into  effect  only on one of the following dates: March first,
  June  first,  September  first  or  December  first;  provided,  that  a
  resolution  providing  for the refund or credit described in subdivision
  (d) of section eleven hundred nineteen of this chapter or repealing such
  provision must go into effect only on March first.  No  such  resolution
  shall  be effective unless a certified copy of such resolution is mailed
  by  registered  or  certified  mail   to   the   commissioner   at   the
  commissioner's  office  in Albany at least ninety days prior to the date
  it is to become effective.  However,  the  commissioner  may  waive  and
  reduce  such  ninety-day minimum notice requirement to a mailing of such
  certified copy by registered or certified mail within a  period  of  not
  less  than  thirty days prior to such effective date if the commissioner
  deems such action to be consistent with the commissioner's duties  under
  section  twelve  hundred fifty of this article and the commissioner acts
  by resolution.
    (f) Certified copies of any resolution described in subdivision (e) of
  this section shall also be filed with the state department of education,
  the secretary of state and the state comptroller within five days  after
  the date it is enacted. Certified copies of any other resolution enacted

   §  1212-A. Certain taxes of cities of one million or more administered
  by commissioner of taxation and finance.--(a) Any  city  in  this  state
  having  a  population  of  one million or more, acting through its local
  legislative body, is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt and  amend
  local  laws  imposing in any such city: (1) a tax on receipts from every
  sale of the service of providing parking, garaging or storing for  motor
  vehicles  by  persons  operating  a garage (other than a garage which is
  part of premises  occupied  solely  as  a  private  one  or  two  family
  dwelling),  parking  lot or other place of business engaged in providing
  parking, garaging or storing for motor vehicles, in  any  county  within
  such  city with a population density in excess of fifty thousand persons
  per square mile, at the rate of eight per centum, on receipts from every
  sale of such services, except receipts from the sale of such services to
  an individual resident of such county when such services are rendered on
  a monthly or  longer-term  basis  at  the  principal  location  for  the
  parking,  garaging  or  storing  of a motor vehicle owned or leased (but
  only in the case of a lease for a term of one  year  or  more)  by  such
  individual  resident.  The population of a county shall be determined by
  reference to the latest federal census.
    (i) For purposes of the  tax  authorized  by  paragraph  one  of  this
  subdivision, the following terms shall mean:
    (A)  "Individual  resident."  A  natural  person  who maintains in the
  county in which such tax is authorized to be imposed a  permanent  place
  of abode which is such person's primary residence.
    (B)  "Motor  vehicle." A motor vehicle which is registered pursuant to
  the vehicle and traffic law at the  address  of  the  primary  residence
  referred  to  in clause (A) of this subparagraph, or which is registered
  pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law  and  leased  to  an  individual
  resident  at  the address of the primary residence referred to in clause
  (A) of this subparagraph, and which is  not  used  in  carrying  on  any
  trade, business or commercial activity.
    (C)  A  "lease  for  a term of one year or more" shall not include any
  lease the term of which is less than one year, irrespective of the  fact
  that  the cumulative period for which such lease may be in effect is one
  year or more as the result of the right to exercise an option  to  renew
  or other like provision.
    (ii)  Notwithstanding  any other provision of law to the contrary, for
  purposes of implementing the exemption of individual residents from  the
  tax  authorized  by  this  paragraph,  the  commissioner of taxation and
  finance shall, subject to such terms and conditions as it  may  consider
  necessary,  delegate to the commissioner of finance of any city imposing
  such tax the power and authority to develop  and  administer  reasonable
  and  necessary  procedures,  including the use of exemption certificates
  for presentation to vendors, for determining  entitlement  to  exemption
  from  such  tax,  and  to  prescribe,  subject  to  the  approval of the
  commissioner of taxation and finance, rules  and  regulations  necessary
  and appropriate in carrying out such responsibilities.
    (iii)  Any  person  who,  in violation of any provision of law enacted
  pursuant to the authorization contained in this paragraph or any rule or
  regulation promulgated thereunder, obtains  or  uses  a  certificate  of
  exemption  relating  to  the  exemption  from the tax authorized by this
  paragraph, shall, if such violation was due to negligence or intentional
  disregard of such provision or rule or regulation (but without intent to
  defraud), be liable for a penalty of not more than one  hundred  dollars
  for  each  such  violation,  and, if such violation was due to fraud, be
  liable for a penalty of not more than five hundred dollars for each such
  violation. The commissioner of finance of any  city  imposing  such  tax
  shall  have the power, in his discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise


 any penalty imposed pursuant to this paragraph. The penalties authorized
  by this subparagraph shall be in addition to  any  penalty  provided  by
  section eleven hundred forty-five of this chapter, and shall be paid and
  disposed  of,  and,  if unpaid, shall be determined, assessed, collected
  and enforced,  in  the  same  manner  as  the  tax  authorized  by  this
  paragraph.
    (iv)   Notwithstanding   this   paragraph,   section   eleven  hundred
  thirty-nine of this chapter  or  any  other  provision  of  law  to  the
  contrary,  an  individual  resident shall not be entitled to a refund or
  credit with respect to any amount of additional tax which was paid to  a
  vendor  prior  to  the  date  such  individual resident presented to the
  vendor a valid certificate of exemption from such tax.
    (2) a tax, at the same uniform rate, but at a rate not to exceed  four
  and  one-half per centum, in multiples of one-half of one per centum, on
  the  receipts  from  every  sale  of  the  following  services:  beauty,
  barbering, hair restoring, manicuring, pedicuring, electrolysis, massage
  services  and  similar  services,  and  every sale of services by weight
  control salons, health salons, gymnasiums, turkish and  sauna  bath  and
  similar  establishments and every charge for the use of such facilities,
  whether  or  not  any  tangible  personal  property  is  transferred  in
  conjunction  therewith;  but excluding services rendered by a physician,
  osteopath, dentist, nurse,  physiotherapist,  chiropractor,  podiatrist,
  optometrist,   ophthalmic  dispenser  or  a  person  performing  similar
  services licensed under title VIII of the education law, as amended, and
  excluding such services when performed on pets and other animals.
    (3) a tax, at the same uniform rate, but at a rate not to exceed  four
  and  one-half per centum, in multiples of one-half of one per centum, on
  the receipts from every sale of any or all of the following services  in
  whole or in part: credit rating, credit reporting, credit adjustment and
  collection  services,  including,  but  not  limited  to, those services
  provided by mercantile and consumer credit rating or  reporting  bureaus
  or  agencies  and  credit  adjustment or collection bureaus or agencies,
  whether rendered in written or oral form or in any other manner,  except
  to  the  extent  otherwise  taxable  under  article twenty-eight of this
  chapter; notwithstanding the foregoing, collection  services  shall  not
  include those services performed by a law office or a law and collection
  office,  the maintenance or conduct of which constitutes the practice of
  law, if the services are performed by an attorney at law  who  has  been
  duly  licensed and admitted to practice law in this state. The local law
  imposing  the  taxes  authorized  by  this  paragraph  may  provide  for
  exclusions  and  exemptions  in  addition  to those provided for in such
  paragraph. Provided, however, that the tax hereby authorized  shall  not
  be imposed after November thirtieth, two thousand twenty-six.
    (b)  (1)  All  provisions  set  forth  in article twenty-eight of this
  chapter applicable to the taxes imposed  under  section  eleven  hundred
  five, including the definition and exemption provisions of such article,
  shall  apply  in  respect  to  a  tax  imposed  under  the  authority of
  subdivision (a) of this  section,  except  as  to  rate  and  except  as
  otherwise  provided  herein.  A  sale of tangible personal property to a
  person for use by him in performing a service subject to the tax imposed
  under the authority of paragraph two or three of subdivision (a) of this
  section shall not be deemed a purchase for resale for  purposes  of  the
  taxes  imposed  by  article twenty-eight or pursuant to the authority of
  this article.
    (2) However, with respect to a tax  imposed  under  the  authority  of
  paragraph  three  of  subdivision (a) of this section a refund or credit
  equal to the amount of the sale  or  compensating  use  tax  imposed  by
  section eleven hundred seven of this chapter and paid on the sale or use


 of  tangible  personal property which is later used by such purchaser in
  performing a service subject  to  tax  under  such  paragraph  shall  be
  allowed  such  purchaser  against  the  tax  imposed  pursuant  to  such
  paragraph  and  collected  by such person on the sale of such service if
  such property has become a physical component part of the property  upon
  which  the service is performed or has been transferred to the purchaser
  of the service in  conjunction  with  the  performance  of  the  service
  subject to tax.
    (3)  Any  tax  imposed  under the authority of subdivision (a) of this
  section shall be paid  with  respect  to  receipts  from  all  sales  of
  services on or after the effective date of such tax although rendered or
  agreed to be rendered under a prior contract. Where a service is sold on
  a  monthly,  quarterly,  yearly or other term basis, the charge for such
  service shall be subject to the tax imposed pursuant to the authority of
  such subdivision to the extent that such charge  is  applicable  to  any
  period  on or after the date such tax becomes effective, and such charge
  shall be apportioned on the basis of the ratio of  the  number  of  days
  falling  within such period to the total number of days in the full term
  or period.
    (4) Wages, salaries and other compensation paid by an employer  to  an
  employee  for  performing  as  an  employee  the  services  described in
  subdivision (a) of this section are not receipts subject  to  the  taxes
  imposed under such subdivision.
    (5)  All  taxes  imposed  pursuant  to subdivision (a) of this section
  shall be administered and collected by the commissioner, as provided  in
  subpart  B  of part III, and shall be distributed by the commissioner as
  provided in part IV of this article.
    (c) A tax so imposed pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be in  addition
  to  any other tax which a city may impose or may be imposing pursuant to
  this article or any other law, and may be so imposed notwithstanding any
  inconsistent provisions  of  this  article  or  of  any  other  law  and
  notwithstanding  that  the  city may impose or may be imposing the taxes
  authorized by section twelve hundred ten at the maximum rate  authorized
  therefor.
    (d) A local law imposing a tax pursuant to this section, increasing or
  decreasing  the  rate  of  such tax, or repealing or suspending such tax
  must go into effect only on one of the  following  dates:  March  first,
  June  first,  September first or December first. No such local law shall
  be effective unless a certified copy of such  local  law  is  mailed  by
  registered  or  certified mail to the commissioner at the commissioner's
  office in Albany at least ninety days prior to the date it is to  become
  effective.   However,   the  commissioner  may  waive  and  reduce  such
  ninety-day minimum notice requirement to a  mailing  of  such  certified
  copy  by  registered  or certified mail within a period of not less than
  thirty days prior to such effective date if the commissioner deems  such
  action  to  be  consistent  with the commissioner's duties under section
  twelve hundred fifty of  this  article  and  the  commissioner  acts  by
  resolution.
    (e)  Certified copies of any local law described in subdivision (d) of
  this section shall also be filed with the city clerk, the  secretary  of
  state  and  the  state comptroller within five days after the date it is
  enacted. Certified copies of any other local  law  enacted  pursuant  to
  this  section  shall be filed with the commissioner, the city clerk, the
  secretary of state and the state comptroller within five days after  the
  date it is enacted.




   §  1213. Deliveries outside the jurisdiction where sale is made. Where
  a sale of tangible personal  property  or  services,  including  prepaid
  telephone  calling  services, but not including other services described
  in subdivision (b) of section  eleven  hundred  five  of  this  chapter,
  including  an  agreement therefor, is made in any city, county or school
  district, but the property sold, the property upon  which  the  services
  were  performed or prepaid telephone calling or other service is or will
  be delivered to the purchaser elsewhere, such sale shall not be  subject
  to  tax  by  such  city, county or school district. However, if delivery
  occurs or will occur in a city, county or school district imposing a tax
  on the sale or use of such property, prepaid telephone calling or  other
  services, the vendor shall be required to collect from the purchaser, as

  vehicle or vessel, including an agreement therefor, is made in any city,

  within such  jurisdiction,  provided  the  purchaser  furnishes  to  the
  vendor, prior to taking delivery, proof satisfactory to the commissioner
  that the purchaser:

  shows that the purchaser's residence is  not  in  any  city,  county  or
  school  district which imposes a tax on the use of such motor vehicle or
  vessel,  and  provided  the  vendor  keeps  such  proof  available   for
  inspection  by  the commissioner and further provided that such proof is
  not known by the vendor, prior to making physical delivery of the  motor
  vehicle or vessel, to be false.

  of  Oneida  and  by the county of Fulton and the city of Gloversville or
  the city of Johnstown as provided in section twelve hundred ten of  this
  article)  at a rate in excess of three percent, except that, in the city
  of Yonkers, in the city of Mount Vernon, in the city of New Rochelle, in

  withdraws   from   the  metropolitan  commuter  transportation  district
  pursuant  to  section  twelve  hundred  seventy-nine-b  of  the   public
  authorities law and if the revenues from a three-eighths percent rate of
  such  tax  imposed  by such county, pursuant to the authority of section
  twelve hundred  ten  of  this  article,  are  required  by  local  laws,
  ordinances  or  resolutions  to  be  set  aside  for mass transportation
  purposes, the rate may not be  in  excess  of  three  and  three-eighths

  reduction in any tax rate imposed thereon by a city,  shall  not  become
  effective  in  respect  to  any  transaction  taxed  by such city (or in
  respect of other similar transactions outside  of  the  city  which,  if
  occurring  in  such  city, would be subject to such city tax) before the
  commencement of the city's next succeeding fiscal year and then only  if
  the  county  shall have given notice to such city of its imposition of a
  tax on such transaction at least six months prior to the commencement of
  such fiscal year, provided however that the local  legislative  body  of
  such  city may waive the requirement of such notice and the postponement
  of the effective date of such tax. A city tax upon any  transaction,  to
  the  extent that it would require a reduction in any tax rate imposed by
  a  county  thereon,  shall  not  become  effective  in  respect  of  any
  transaction taxed by such county before the commencement of the county's
  next  succeeding  fiscal year and then only if the city shall have given
  notice to such county of its imposition of a tax on such transaction  at
  least  six  months  prior  to  the  commencement  of  such  fiscal year,
  provided, however, that the local legislative body of  such  county  may
  waive  the  requirement of such notice and postponement of the effective
  date of such tax.  However,  whether  or  not  the  six  months'  notice


 requirement  provided  in  this  section  has been waived, a tax imposed
  pursuant to the authority  of  section  twelve  hundred  ten  or  twelve
  hundred  eleven  shall still be subject to the requirements provided for
  in  the first three sentences of subdivision (d) of such sections and in
  subdivision (e) of such sections.

   §  1235.  Taxes paid to other jurisdictions. (a) With respect to taxes
  imposed pursuant to subdivision (a) of section twelve  hundred  ten  and
  pursuant  to section twelve hundred eleven, the use of tangible personal
  property purchased at retail and of any of the services subject  to  the
  sales tax shall be exempt from the compensating use tax authorized under
  subdivision  (a)  of  such  section twelve hundred ten and under section
  twelve hundred eleven, to the extent  that  a  retail  sales  tax  or  a
  compensating use tax was legally due and paid thereon, without any right
  to  a refund or credit thereof, to (1) any municipal corporation in this
  state or (2) any other state or jurisdiction within any other state, but
  only when it is shown that such other state  or  jurisdiction  allows  a
  corresponding  exemption  with  respect  to  the sale or use of tangible
  personal property or of any of the services upon which such  a  sale  or
  compensating  use  tax  was  paid to this state and any of its municipal
  corporations, except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section.
    (b) To the extent that a compensating use tax imposed pursuant to this
  article and the compensating use tax imposed by article twenty-eight are
  at a higher aggregate rate than the rate of tax  imposed  in  any  other
  state  or jurisdiction within any other state, the exemption provided in
  subdivision (a) of this section shall  be  inapplicable  and  the  taxes
  imposed pursuant to this article and by article twenty-eight shall apply
  to the extent of the difference between such aggregate rate and the rate
  paid  in  such  other state or jurisdiction.   In such event, the amount
  payable shall be allocated between the  tax  imposed  pursuant  to  this
  article and the tax imposed by article twenty-eight in proportion to the
  respective  rates  of  such  taxes.  Where  a  retail  sales  tax  or  a
  compensating  use  tax  was  legally  due  and  paid  to  any  municipal
  corporation  in  this  state,  without  any  right to a refund or credit
  thereof, with respect to the sale or use of tangible  personal  property
  or  any of the services subject to sales or compensating use tax, if the
  use of such property or services is then subject to a  compensating  use
  tax  imposed  by  any other municipal corporation in this state and such
  tax is at a higher rate than the  rate  of  tax  imposed  by  the  first
  municipal  corporation,  the  tax  of the municipal corporation with the
  higher rate shall also apply but only to the extent of the difference in
  such rates and  such  tax  shall  be  distributable  to  such  municipal
  corporation,  pursuant  to  section  twelve  hundred  sixty-one, without
  allocation as hereinabove provided.  Where  a  retail  sales  tax  or  a
  compensating  use  tax was legally due and paid to this state only, with
  respect to the sale or use of tangible personal property or any  of  the
  services  subject  to  sales or compensating use tax, if the use of such
  property or services is then subject to a compensating use  tax  imposed
  by   a   municipal   corporation  in  this  state,  such  tax  shall  be
  distributable to the municipal corporation, pursuant to  section  twelve
  hundred sixty-one, without allocation as hereinabove provided.
    (c) For purposes of this section, a payment to the tax commission of a
  tax imposed by a municipal corporation shall be deemed a payment to such
  municipal corporation.

  which are now imposed shall continue to be administered and collected by
  the  fiscal  or other officers of the city, county or school district in
  the same manner as such taxes have been administered  and  collected  by
  such  officers  immediately  prior  to the enactment of this article, in
  accordance with the applicable provisions of the charter, administrative
  code, local law, ordinance  or  resolution  then  in  force,  with  such
  amendments  in  respect  to  administration  and  collection  as  may be
  enacted. Taxes authorized under  sections  twelve  hundred  one  through
  twelve  hundred four of this article which may hereafter be imposed by a
  city, county or school district shall be administered and  collected  in
  such  manner  as  may  be  provided in its charter, administrative code,
  local laws, ordinances or resolutions, with such amendments  in  respect
  to  administration and collection as may be enacted. Notwithstanding any
  other provision of law to the contrary, the authorization to impose  tax
  upon  the  transfer  of  real  property  pursuant  to subdivision (b) of
  section twelve  hundred  one  of  this  article,  shall  not,  when  the
  conveyance  consists  of  a  transfer of property made as a result of an
  order of the court in a foreclosure proceeding ordering the sale of such
  property,  include  the  authorization  to  impose  civil  or   criminal
  penalties,  interest,  or  other  liability  upon the referee or sheriff

  such  county and city of one or more taxes which may be imposed pursuant
  to the authority of sections twelve hundred two and twelve hundred three
  by such county or city, as the  case  may  be,  and  for  the  joint  or
  cooperative  administration  and  collection  of  any such tax or taxes,
  including common use of a single agency  therefor.  Such  agreement  may
  make provision, consistent with law, for the custody and distribution of
  the  proceeds  of  any  such  tax;  the appointment and removal, powers,
  duties, and compensation of officers and employees; the availability  of
  necessary funds and the audit and payment of expenses of administration;
  and  such  other  matters  as are necessary and proper to effectuate the
  purposes of such agreement.
    (b) By agreement for a period of not to exceed one year, the board  of
  supervisors  or  other elective governing body of a county and the local
  legislative body of a city in  such  county  may,  from  year  to  year,
  provide  that  the city shall have the sole right to impose in such city
  one or more of the taxes described in sections twelve  hundred  two  and
  twelve  hundred three and that the county shall have the right to impose
  such tax or taxes only in the area of the county outside such  city.  In
  such  event  the  net collections received by the county from such a tax
  shall be allocated, applied and distributed to such area in  the  manner
  provided by subdivision (d) of section twelve hundred sixty-two.
    (c) Where a city imposes a tax described in subdivision (e) of section
  twelve  hundred  one,  as  provided in section twelve hundred three, the
  governing body of the city may provide by agreement with  the  governing
  body of the county in which such city is contained for the collection of
  such tax by the clerk of such county. Such agreement may make provision,
  notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special or local law, for
  the  safekeeping  of  moneys so collected; the bonding at the expense of
  the city of  officers  and  employees  collecting  or  safekeeping  such
  moneys;  compensation  to  the county for such services at a rate not in
  excess of twenty-five cents for each vehicle the  use  of  which  is  so
  taxed;  periodic  payment  to  the city of money so collected, less such
  compensation; reporting to the city of registrations of  motor  vehicles
  issued by such clerk pursuant to section two hundred five of the vehicle
  and  traffic  law; and such other matters as are necessary and proper to
  effectuate the purposes of such agreement.




   § 1242. Limitations on assessment. (a) Cities over one million. Except
  in  the  case  of  a  wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to
  evade the tax, no assessment  of  additional  tax  shall  be  made  with
  respect  to  the  taxes  imposed  under  the authority of section twelve
  hundred one, after the expiration of more than three years from the date
  of the filing of a return, provided, however, that where no  return  has
  been filed, or where the taxpayer fails to file a report in respect of a
  change  or  correction  in  the amount of sales and compensating use tax
  liability relating to the purchase or use of items for which a sales  or
  compensating  use tax credit against the tax was claimed, as provided by
  law, the tax may be assessed at  any  time.  Notwithstanding  the  prior
  sentence,  no assessment of additional tax shall be made with respect to
  taxes imposed under local laws enacted prior  to  July  first,  nineteen
  hundred  thirty-eight,  except  in  the  case  of  a  wilfully  false or
  fraudulent return with intent to evade the  tax.    Where  the  taxpayer
  files  a  report  in  respect  of  a  change  or correction in sales and
  compensating use tax liability, as provided by law, an assessment may be
  made at any time within two years after such report was filed.
    (b) Cities under one million, counties and school districts. Except in
  the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent  to  evade
  the  tax,  no assessment of additional tax shall be made with respect to
  taxes imposed under the authority of sections twelve hundred two through
  twelve hundred four, after the expiration of more than three years  from
  the  date  of  the  filing of a return, provided, however, that where no
  return has been filed as provided by local law, ordinance or resolution,
  the tax may be assessed at any time.




   §  1243. Judicial review. (a) Any final determination of the amount of
  any tax payable under sections twelve hundred one through twelve hundred
  four shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or
  any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article  seventy-eight
  of  the  civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to
  the supreme court within four months after the giving of the  notice  of
  such  final  determination,  provided, however, that any such proceeding
  under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law  and  rules  shall
  not  be instituted by a taxpayer unless (1) the amount of any tax sought
  to be reviewed, with such interest  and  penalties  thereon  as  may  be
  provided for by local law, ordinance, resolution or regulation, shall be
  first  deposited  and  there is filed an undertaking, issued by a surety
  company authorized to transact business in this state  and  approved  by
  the  superintendent  of  financial services of this state as to solvency
  and responsibility, in such amount as a justice  of  the  supreme  court
  shall  approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the
  tax confirmed the taxpayer will pay all  costs  and  charges  which  may
  accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding or (2) at the option of the
  taxpayer,  such  undertaking  may  be  in  a sum sufficient to cover the
  taxes, interest and penalties stated in  such  determination,  plus  the
  costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  against  such  taxpayer  in the
  prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the taxpayer shall not  be
  required  to  pay  such  taxes,  interest  or  penalties  as a condition
  precedent to the application.
    (b) Where any tax  imposed  hereunder  shall  have  been  erroneously,
  illegally  or  unconstitutionally  assessed or collected and application
  for the refund or revision  thereof  duly  made  to  the  proper  fiscal
  officer  or  officers, and such officer or officers or, in the case of a
  city of one  million  or  more  which  has  established  a  tax  appeals
  tribunal,  such  tax  appeals  tribunal, shall have made a determination
  denying such refund or revision, such determination shall be  reviewable
  by  a  proceeding  under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law
  and rules, provided, however, (1) that  such  proceeding  is  instituted
  within  four  months  after the giving of the notice of such denial, (2)
  that a final determination of tax due was not previously made,  and  (3)
  that  an undertaking is filed with the proper fiscal officer or officers
  in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme  court
  shall  approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the
  tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs  and  charges  which  may
  accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.




   §  1250.  Administration  and  collection. The taxes imposed under the
  authority of sections twelve hundred ten, twelve hundred eleven,  twelve
  hundred  twelve  and  twelve  hundred twelve-A shall be administered and
  collected by the state tax commission in the same manner  as  the  taxes
  imposed  under article twenty-eight of this chapter are administered and
  collected by such commission.   All of the provisions  of  such  article
  relating  to  or  applicable to the administration and collection of the
  taxes imposed by that article shall apply to the taxes imposed under the
  authority of section twelve hundred ten, twelve hundred  eleven,  twelve
  hundred  twelve  or  twelve  hundred twelve-A, including sections eleven
  hundred one and  eleven  hundred  eleven  and  sections  eleven  hundred
  thirty-one  through  eleven hundred forty-seven, with the same force and
  effect as if those provisions had been incorporated in  full  into  this
  article  and  had expressly referred to the taxes imposed under sections
  twelve hundred ten through twelve hundred twelve-A, except to the extent
  that any provisions of such article twenty-eight are either inconsistent
  with a provision of this article or are not relevant  to  this  article.
  For  purposes of this article, the term "tax" in part IV of such article
  twenty-eight shall include  any  tax  imposed  under  the  authority  of
  section twelve hundred ten, twelve hundred eleven, twelve hundred twelve
  or  twelve hundred twelve-A. Wherever there is joint collection of state
  and local  taxes,  it  shall  be  deemed  that  such  collections  shall
  represent  proportionally  the  applicable  state  and  local  taxes  in
  determining the amount to be remitted to local taxing jurisdictions.




   § 1251. Returns. (a) Every person required to collect any of the taxes

  the taxes imposed by each county, city or school district,  pursuant  to
  the  authority  of  section  twelve  hundred ten, twelve hundred eleven,

  Rather,  such  returns  shall only show the aggregate amount of all such
  local taxes calculated in the manner provided for in  paragraph  (i)  or
  (ii) of subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred thirty-six except that
  in the case of a short-form, part-quarterly return, where a county, city
  or school district did not impose a tax in the comparable quarter of the
  immediately   preceding  year,  the  tax  for  that  locality  shall  be
  calculated on such basis as  the  tax  commission  shall  by  regulation
  prescribe.
    (b)  The  returns required by this section to be filed quarterly shall
  be filed for quarterly periods ending on the last day of February,  May,

  shorter  periods  than  those  prescribed  pursuant  to  the   foregoing
  subdivisions of this section, and upon such dates as it may specify.
    (d)  The form of returns shall be prescribed by the tax commission and

  the public authorities law:  (A)  in  state  fiscal  year  two  thousand
  nineteen  -  two  thousand twenty, one hundred twenty-seven million five
  hundred thousand dollars; (B) in state fiscal year two thousand twenty -
  two thousand twenty-one, one hundred seventy million dollars; and (C) in

    * NB Effective April 3, 2025
    (6) Where the amount so paid over to any city, county, school district
  or the special sales and compensating use  tax  fund  for  the  city  of
  Yonkers  in  any  such  distribution or to any such authority is more or
  less than the amount then due to such city, county, school  district  or
  such  fund  or  to  such  authority,  the  amount  of the overpayment or
  underpayment shall be certified to the comptroller by  the  commissioner
  or  the  commissioner's  delegate,  who shall not be held liable for any
  inaccuracy in  such  certificate.  The  amount  of  the  overpayment  or
  underpayment  shall be so certified to the comptroller as soon after the
  discovery of the overpayment or underpayment as reasonably possible  and
  subsequent  payments  and distributions by the comptroller to such city,
  county, school district or the special sales and  compensating  use  tax
  fund  for  the city of Yonkers or to such authority shall be adjusted by
  subtracting the amount of any such overpayment from  or  by  adding  the
  amount  of  any  such underpayment to such number of subsequent payments
  and distributions as the comptroller and the commissioner shall consider
  reasonable in view of the amount of the overpayment or underpayment  and
  all other facts and circumstances.


   (d)  All  of  the provisions of this section shall apply to the taxes,
  penalties and interest from sales and compensating use  taxes  on  sales
  and  uses  of  motor  fuel or diesel motor fuel imposed pursuant to this
  article except that the amount  certified  to  the  comptroller  by  the
  commissioner  or the commissioner's delegate with respect to such taxes,
  penalties and interest shall be based  upon  the  receipts  from  retail
  sales  of  motor  fuel  or  diesel  motor fuel sold each month at retail
  service stations and on other sales of such fuel for consumption by  the
  purchaser  in  each  county  and  city  imposing  such  taxes, the total
  receipts from taxes paid pursuant to the provisions  of  section  eleven
  hundred  two of this article on motor fuel and diesel motor fuel sold in
  this state each month, the total of the taxes,  penalties  and  interest
  collected  or  received  in  such month with respect to retail sales and
  uses of motor fuel and diesel motor fuel (determined without  regard  to
  the  refunds  or credits allowed pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) of
  section eleven hundred twenty of  this  article),  the  sales  tax  rate
  applicable  for  that month in such county or city, the regional average
  retail sales price for such month, the amount  of  refunds  and  credits
  allowed  pursuant  to subdivisions (c) and (d) of section eleven hundred
  twenty of this article  and  such  other  data  and  standards  as  such
  commissioner  or delegate may deem necessary for such certification. The
  commissioner or the commissioner's delegate shall arrive at  the  number
  of  gallons of motor fuel and diesel motor fuel sold in each such county
  or city and in this state by use of the reports of the number of gallons
  sold required to be filed pursuant to section eleven hundred  thirty-six
  of  this  chapter  and  such  other  information as such commissioner or
  delegate deems appropriate. In arriving at the amount  to  be  certified
  and  distributed, the commissioner shall consider the collections of the
  taxes, penalties and interest  required  to  be  paid  pursuant  to  the
  provisions  of  section  eleven  hundred  two  of  this  article and the
  authorized refunds and credits of the  tax  imposed  by  section  eleven
  hundred  two  of this article against the taxes required to be collected
  or paid pursuant to this article.
    (e) The total net collections from a tax imposed pursuant  to  section
  twelve  hundred  eleven  by  a  city  and  a  school  district or school
  districts, so authorized, shall be distributed  and  paid  to  the  city
  school district where it is coterminous with or includes the entire city
  or to all the school districts partly within or wholly within such city.
  Except  where  the  city school district is coterminous with the city or
  includes the entire area of the city, such amounts shall be  distributed
  and  paid  to  the  school district or districts partly within or wholly
  within the city, in accordance with the total average  daily  attendance
  for  the  last  preceding  school  year  of pupils residing in each such
  district and without regard to the location of the school attended.
    (f) Notwithstanding any provision of state or local law, ordinance  or
  resolution  to  the  contrary,  if  the  commissioner  of  health timely
  certifies to the commissioner that a  county  which  imposes  sales  and
  compensating  use  taxes  pursuant  to  the  authority of section twelve
  hundred ten, twelve  hundred  ten-A,  twelve  hundred  ten-B  or  twelve
  hundred ten-C of this article properly exercised its option by September
  thirtieth, two thousand seven, pursuant to section two of the chapter of
  the  laws  of  two thousand five which added this subdivision, that such
  county be reimbursed for medical assistance expenditures as provided  in
  such  section two of such chapter, then the commissioner shall calculate
  the Medicaid amount of each such county. The amount due  each  month  to
  each  such  county provided for in subdivision (c) of this section shall
  be reduced by the monthly Medicaid amount;  and  such  monthly  Medicaid
  amount  of  each such county shall instead be paid into the general fund


 of the state treasury to  the  credit  of  the  state  purposes  account
  therein.  The  calculation  of  each  such  county's Medicaid amount and
  monthly Medicaid amounts and the procedures  governing  the  payment  of
  such amounts shall be as follows:
    (1) The commissioner of health shall furnish the commissioner with the
  amount  of  every  county's  "two thousand six-two thousand seven fiscal
  year social services district expenditure cap amount,"  as  provided  in
  paragraph  (e)  of  section one of a chapter of the laws of two thousand
  five which added this subdivision, as soon as practicable but  no  later
  than April first, two thousand seven.
    (2)  The  commissioner shall calculate the "Medicaid factor" for every
  county as follows and shall notify each county's chief fiscal officer of
  the results of such calculation by April thirtieth, two thousand  seven,
  to help each county determine whether to exercise such option:
    (A)  for a county in which no city exercises any prior right to impose
  sales or compensating use taxes authorized by section twelve hundred ten
  of  this  article,  first,  divide  the  total  amount  of   sales   and
  compensating  use  tax  distributions to such county during state fiscal
  year two thousand six-two thousand seven by the county's general rate of
  such taxes during  such  period,  and  then  divide  the  county's  "two
  thousand  six-two  thousand  seven  fiscal year social services district
  expenditure cap amount" by the quotient of the first division;
    (B) for a county in which one or more cities exercise any prior  right
  to  impose  sales or compensating use taxes authorized by section twelve
  hundred ten of this article and the combined rate of  the  county's  and
  city's  taxes  in each such city equals the general rate of the county's
  taxes on similar transactions in the area of  the  county  outside  such
  city  or  cities, first, add the total amounts of sales and compensating
  use tax distributions to such county and to each such city during  state
  fiscal  year  two thousand six-two thousand seven and divide such sum by
  the county's general rate of such taxes during  such  period,  and  then
  divide  the  county's  "two  thousand six-two thousand seven fiscal year
  social services district expenditure cap amount" by the quotient of  the
  first division; and
    (C)  for a county in which one or more cities exercise any prior right
  to impose sales or compensating use taxes authorized by  section  twelve
  hundred  ten  of  this article and the combined rate of the county's and
  city's taxes in any such city does not equal the  general  rate  of  the
  county's taxes on similar transactions in the area of the county outside
  such city or cities:
    (i) for each such city, add the total amount of sales and compensating
  use tax distributions to such city during state fiscal year two thousand
  six-two  thousand  seven  and  divide  such  sum by the city's effective
  general rate of such  taxes  during  such  period,  then  multiply  such
  quotient  by  the  amount by which the city's rate forced a reduction in
  the county's rate of such taxes in such city  during  such  period,  and
  then
    (ii)  add  the  amount  derived in clause (i) of this subparagraph for
  each such city to the total amount of sales  and  compensating  use  tax
  distributions  to  such  county  during  state  fiscal year two thousand
  six-two thousand seven;
    (iii) divide the  total  of  the  addition  in  clause  (ii)  of  this
  subparagraph  by  the  county's  general  rate of such taxes during such
  period; and
    (iv) divide the county's "two thousand six-two thousand  seven  fiscal
  year social services district expenditure cap amount" by the quotient of
  the division in clause (iii) of this subparagraph.


   (D) The commissioner shall consider any change in a county's or city's
  general  rate  of  sales  and  compensating use taxes which takes effect
  during state fiscal year two thousand six-two  thousand  seven  and  the
  number  of months such rates are in effect during such state fiscal year
  in  order  to  perform  accurately the calculations provided for in this
  paragraph.
    (3) By the twelfth day of  each  month,  commencing  in  January,  two
  thousand  eight,  the commissioner shall calculate the "monthly Medicaid
  amount" of each such county which has made the election described in the
  opening paragraph of this subdivision and certify such  amounts  to  the
  comptroller.  The  comptroller shall reduce the amount due each month to
  each such county provided for in subdivision (c) of this section by such
  monthly Medicaid amount; and the comptroller shall  instead  each  month
  pay  the  monthly  Medicaid  amount of each such county into the general
  fund of the state treasury to the credit of the state  purposes  account
  therein,  provided,  however,  that  the  comptroller,  subject  to  the
  limitations provided in paragraphs five and  six  of  this  subdivision,
  shall  each  month  collect the amount of Nassau county's reduction from
  amounts payable to such county by  the  Nassau  county  interim  finance
  authority while such authority exists.
    (4)  "Monthly  Medicaid amount" shall mean the result of the following
  calculations:
    (A) for a county described in subparagraph (A)  of  paragraph  two  of
  this  subdivision,  first,  the  amount of the comptroller's payment due
  such a county in  the  immediately  preceding  month,  as  described  in
  subdivision  (c)  of  this  section  and as described in sections twelve
  hundred ten-A, twelve hundred ten-B and twelve  hundred  ten-C  of  this
  article,  but without regard to whether the comptroller is to pay all or
  a portion of such amount to another entity described in subdivision  (c)
  of this section and without regard to the revenue disposition provisions
  of  such  section  twelve  hundred ten-A, twelve hundred ten-B or twelve
  hundred ten-C, and considered without regard  to  any  Medicaid  amount,
  shall  be divided by the county's general rate of sales and compensating
  use taxes in such month; and the quotient  of  that  division  shall  be
  multiplied by the Medicaid factor calculated as provided in subparagraph
  (A) of paragraph two of this subdivision.
    (B)  for  a  county  described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph two of
  this subdivision, first, add the amount of the comptroller's payment due
  any city in such  a  county  in  the  immediately  preceding  month,  as
  described  in  subdivision  (c)  of  this  section  to the amount of the
  comptroller's payment due such a county  in  the  immediately  preceding
  month,  as described in subdivision (c) of this section and as described
  in sections twelve  hundred  ten-A,  twelve  hundred  ten-B  and  twelve
  hundred  ten-C  of  this  article,  but  without  regard  to whether the
  comptroller is to pay all or a portion of such amount to another  entity
  described  in  subdivision (c) of this section and without regard to the
  revenue disposition provisions of such  section  twelve  hundred  ten-A,
  twelve  hundred  ten-B  or  twelve hundred ten-C, and considered without
  regard to any Medicaid amount, then divide the total of such amounts  by
  the  county's  general  rate of sales and compensating use taxes in such
  month; and the quotient of that division  shall  be  multiplied  by  the
  Medicaid  factor calculated as provided in subparagraph (B) of paragraph
  two of this subdivision.
    (C) For a county described in subparagraph (C)  of  paragraph  two  of
  this subdivision:
    (i)  with  respect  to  each  such city described in subparagraph (C),
  divide the amount of the comptroller's payment due each such city in the
  immediately preceding month, as described in  subdivision  (c)  of  this


 section,  by the effective general rate of such city's taxes during such
  month and multiply such quotient by the amount by which the city's  rate
  forced  a  reduction  in  the  county's  rate of such taxes in such city
  during such month;
    (ii)  add  the  amount  or  amounts  derived  in  clause  (i)  of this
  subparagraph to the amount of the comptroller's payment due such  county
  in  the  immediately preceding month, as described in subdivision (c) of
  this section and as described in sections twelve hundred  ten-A,  twelve
  hundred  ten-B  and  twelve  hundred  ten-C of this article, but without
  regard to whether the comptroller is to pay all or  a  portion  of  such
  amount  to  another  entity described in subdivision (c) of this section
  and without regard to the revenue disposition provisions of such section
  twelve hundred ten-A, twelve hundred ten-B or twelve hundred ten-C,  and
  considered without regard to any Medicaid amount; and
    (iii)  divide  the  total  of  the  addition  in  clause  (ii) of this
  subparagraph by the county's general rate  of  such  taxes  during  such
  month,  and  the  quotient  of  that division shall be multiplied by the
  Medicaid factor calculated as provided in subparagraph (C) of  paragraph
  two of this subdivision.
    (5)  If  for  any reason a county's monthly Medicaid amount is greater
  than the amount of the comptroller's net payment to the county for  that
  month  under  subdivision  (c) of this section and under sections twelve
  hundred ten-A, twelve hundred ten-B and twelve  hundred  ten-C  of  this
  article,  after  the comptroller has made any payments to other entities
  required by subdivision (c) of this section or  by  any  other  law  and
  after  any  payment,  deposit,  appropriation,  transfer  or expenditure
  required or authorized by such  section  twelve  hundred  ten-A,  twelve
  hundred  ten-B  or  twelve  hundred ten-C, the comptroller shall, at the
  same time that the comptroller makes the payment and reduction described
  in paragraph three of this subdivision, bill such county an amount equal
  to the difference and such county shall pay in full the amount  of  such
  bill  to  the  comptroller  by  the twenty-fifth day of such month. Such
  county shall use any funds  available  to  it  to  pay  such  bill.  The
  comptroller  shall  deposit  any  such amounts received into the general
  fund of the state treasury to the credit of the state  purposes  account
  therein.
    (6)  If  a  county does not remit the required monies or pay in full a
  bill described in paragraph five of this subdivision by the twenty-fifth
  day of the month in accordance with paragraph five of this  subdivision,
  the comptroller shall, as soon as any other moneys payable to the county
  are  available, either deduct any amount not paid from the amount of the
  next payment or payments due such county pursuant to subdivision (c)  of
  this  section  until  such amount not paid has been recovered or, in the
  alternative and at the comptroller's discretion, deduct any  amount  not
  paid from the amount of any other moneys payable to such county from the
  comptroller  and  not  subject  to any lien or pledge for the benefit of
  bondholders of the Nassau county interim finance  authority  or  of  any
  public  benefit  corporation,  as  defined  in  section sixty-six of the
  general construction law, created by interstate compact or at least half
  of whose members are appointed by the governor, until  such  amount  not
  paid  has  been  recovered. The comptroller shall deposit any amounts so
  deducted and recovered into the general fund of the  state  treasury  to
  the credit of the state purposes account therein.
    (7)  This subdivision shall apply to payments required in respect of a
  county  to  be  made  on  January  twelfth,  two  thousand  eight,   and
  thereafter.
    (8) Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to relieve a county
  of  any  obligation  or commitment to distribute and pay or allocate net


 collections pursuant to this part, regardless whether such obligation or
  commitment arises before or after the date this subdivision  shall  have
  taken  effect,  or  to  preclude  a city in a county from exercising its
  prior  rights  under section twelve hundred twenty-four of this article.
  To the extent that a county's net collections have been diminished below
  a level sufficient to meet any such obligation or commitment as a result
  of the reductions or bills provided for in this subdivision, such county
  shall hereby be authorized to use any other funds  available  to  it  to
  meet  such  obligation  or  commitment,  notwithstanding  any law to the
  contrary.
    (9) If a county adopts or amends a local law, ordinance or  resolution
  to  repeal  its sales and compensating use taxes, then, effective on the
  first day of the first month on which such  repeal  takes  effect,  such
  county's  resolution  electing  to  be  reimbursed  for  certain medical
  assistance expenditures pursuant to section two of the  chapter  of  the
  laws  of  two  thousand  five which added this subdivision shall also be
  repealed automatically as of  such  date;  and  the  commissioner  shall
  notify the commissioner of health of such county's repeal of such taxes.
  In  that  event,  as of such date, such county shall be treated as if it
  had never made such election for purposes of such expenditures and  such
  commissioner  of health shall thenceforth compute the amount due monthly
  from such county for such expenditures pursuant to section  one  of  the
  chapter of the laws of two thousand five which added this subdivision.
    (g)  Notwithstanding any provision of state or local law, ordinance or
  resolution to  the  contrary,  if  the  commissioner  of  health  timely
  certifies  to  the  commissioner  that a city having a population of one
  million or more in which the taxes imposed  by  section  eleven  hundred
  seven  of  this  chapter  are  in  effect  or  which  imposes  sales and
  compensating use taxes pursuant  to  the  authority  of  section  twelve
  hundred  ten  of this article properly exercised its option by September
  thirtieth, two thousand seven, pursuant to section two of the chapter of
  the laws of two thousand five which added this  subdivision,  that  such
  city  be  reimbursed  for medical assistance expenditures as provided in
  such section two of such chapter, then the commissioner shall  calculate
  the  Medicaid amount of such a city. The amount due each month to such a
  city with respect to  such  taxes  and  certain  other  taxes  shall  be
  reduced;  and  the  amount  of each such reduction shall instead be paid
  into the general fund of the state treasury to the credit of  the  state
  purposes  account  therein.  The  calculation  of such a city's Medicaid
  amount and reductions and the procedure governing the  payment  of  such
  amounts are as follows:
    (1) The commissioner of health shall furnish the commissioner with the
  amount of such a city's "two thousand six-two thousand seven fiscal year
  social  services  district  expenditure  cap  amount,"  as  provided  in
  paragraph (e) of section one of the chapter of the laws of two  thousand
  five  which  added this subdivision, as soon as practicable but no later
  than April first, two thousand seven.
    (2) The commissioner shall use or calculate the following  amounts  in
  respect  of  such  a  city,  which  amounts  shall  be designated by the
  following symbols, in order to determine the components of  the  monthly
  amount described in paragraph three of this subdivision and shall notify
  the  chief fiscal officer of such city of the calculated value of "D" as
  described  in  this  paragraph  and  such  other  information  available
  relating to D, by April thirtieth, two thousand seven, to help such city
  determine whether to exercise such option:
    (A)  "A" shall equal the amount of such a city's "two thousand six-two
  thousand seven fiscal year  social  services  district  expenditure  cap


 amount,"  as  furnished  by  the  commissioner  of  health  pursuant  to
  paragraph one of this subdivision;
    (B)(i) "B1" shall equal the total amount of sales and compensating use
  tax distributions during state fiscal year two thousand six-two thousand
  seven  to  such  city  or  to a municipal assistance corporation on such
  city's behalf from taxes imposed in such city by section eleven  hundred
  seven  of  this  chapter, other than taxes imposed by subdivision (c) of
  such section eleven hundred seven, at the rate of three percent;
    (ii) "B2" shall equal the total  amount  of  sales  tax  distributions
  during  state  fiscal  year  two thousand six-two thousand seven to such
  city or to a municipal assistance corporation on such city's behalf from
  taxes imposed in such city by subdivision (c) of section eleven  hundred
  seven of this chapter, at the rate of three percent;
    (C) "C" shall equal the total amount of sales and compensating use tax
  distributions  during  state  fiscal  year two thousand six-two thousand
  seven to such city from its taxes imposed pursuant to the  authority  of
  section twelve hundred twelve-A of this article; and
    (D)  "D" shall be the "Base Year PIT intercept amount" and shall equal
  A less the sum of B1, B2 and C.
    (3) (A) Commencing in January, two thousand  eight,  the  commissioner
  shall  calculate  the  monthly  Medicaid  amount  ("MA")  for  such city
  according to the following formula: MA equals  (((En/Fn)  +  (Ep/Fp))  X
  (.03))  +  (C/12)  X (G) + (D/12) X (G); where C and D equal the amounts
  described in paragraph two of this subdivision; "En" equals the  current
  month's portion of revenues from taxes imposed by section eleven hundred
  seven  of  this  chapter,  excluding  revenues  from  the tax on parking
  imposed by subdivision (c) of such section eleven hundred seven, or from
  taxes imposed pursuant to the authority of subdivision  (a)  of  section
  twelve  hundred  ten of this article, excluding revenues from the tax on
  parking authorized by subdivision (a) of  such  section  twelve  hundred
  ten;  "Ep"  equals  the current month's revenues from either such tax on
  parking, as the case may be; "Fn" equals  the  current  month's  general
  rate of sales and use taxes imposed by such section eleven hundred seven
  or  pursuant  to the authority of such section twelve hundred ten, other
  than on parking; "Fp" equals the current month's rate of  sales  tax  on
  parking  under  or  pursuant  to  the  authority  of such section eleven
  hundred seven or twelve hundred ten, as the case may be;  "G"  equals  a
  growth  factor  according  to  the  formula  G  equals (En/Fn) + (Ep/Fp)
  divided by ((MB1/.04) + (MB2/.06)); "MB1" equals the revenues from taxes
  imposed by section eleven  hundred  seven  of  this  chapter,  excluding
  revenues  from  such  tax  on parking imposed by subdivision (c) of such
  section eleven hundred seven, during the same month of state fiscal year
  two thousand six-two thousand seven corresponding to the  current  month
  described  above; and "MB2" equals the revenues from such tax on parking
  during the same month of state fiscal year two thousand six-two thousand
  seven corresponding to the current month described above.
    (B) Using the amount of MA calculated each month in  subparagraph  (A)
  of  this paragraph, the commissioner shall then calculate the amounts of
  sales and use tax revenues (E + H, where  E  and  H  equal  the  amounts
  described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph) and personal income tax
  revenues (PIT) of such city which are to be intercepted or billed for as
  described  in this subdivision, according to the formula MA equals E + H
  + PIT, as PIT is defined in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph.  By  the
  twelfth  day  of  each month, commencing in January, two thousand eight,
  the commissioner shall establish the amount of E and H and certify  such
  amounts  to  the  comptroller  and  by  the fifteenth day of each month,
  commencing in  January,  two  thousand  eight,  the  commissioner  shall


 establish the amount of PIT and certify such amount and the amount of MA
  to the comptroller, in the manner set forth in this paragraph.
    (C)  (i)  For the period commencing January first, two thousand eight,
  and ending on the last day of the month in which the  taxes  imposed  in
  such  a  city  by  section  eleven  hundred  seven of this chapter shall
  expire, the sales and use tax component "E" shall equal  the  amount  of
  revenues  from  such  taxes  imposed at the rate of three percent or the
  amount of revenues from such taxes imposed at the rate of  four  percent
  after  payments  to the municipal assistance corporation for such a city
  required under section ninety-two-d of the state finance law  have  been
  made, whichever amount is less, and "H" shall equal net collections from
  taxes imposed by such a city pursuant to the authority of section twelve
  hundred  twelve-A  of  this  article, due such a city in the immediately
  preceding month.
    (ii) For the period commencing on the first day  of  the  first  month
  following  the  period described in clause (i) of this subparagraph, the
  sales and use tax component "E" shall equal net collections  from  sales
  and  compensating  use  taxes  imposed  by  such  city  pursuant  to the
  authority of subdivision (a) of  section  twelve  hundred  ten  of  this
  article  up  to  the  rate  of  three  percent  and  "H" shall equal net
  collections from taxes imposed by such city pursuant to the authority of
  section twelve hundred twelve-A of this article, due such a city in  the
  immediately preceding month.
    (D)  For  the period commencing January first, two thousand eight, the
  PIT component for each month shall be designated "PIT" and  shall  equal
  the  portion of the revenues from taxes imposed by such city pursuant to
  the authority of article thirty of this chapter due such a city  in  the
  immediately  preceding  month,  calculated according to the formula: PIT
  equals MA - E - H.
    (E)(i) During the period that the taxes imposed  in  such  a  city  by
  section  eleven  hundred  seven  of  this  chapter  are  in  effect, the
  comptroller shall each month, after paying amounts certified to  by  the
  chairperson  of  the  municipal assistance corporation created in aid of
  such city, as provided for in section ninety-two-d of the state  finance
  law,  pay  the  relevant  portion  of  the  sales  and use tax component
  relating to such taxes imposed by such section eleven hundred seven  for
  such month equal to E into the general fund of the state treasury to the
  credit of the state purposes account therein.
    (ii)  During the period that the taxes imposed by such a city pursuant
  to the authority of section twelve hundred ten of this  article  are  in
  effect,  the  comptroller shall reduce the amount due each month to such
  city from such taxes provided for in subdivision (c) of this section  by
  the  relevant  portion of the sales and use tax component for such month
  equal to E; and the  comptroller  shall  instead  each  month  pay  such
  portion into the general fund of the state treasury to the credit of the
  state purposes account therein.
    (iii)  The  comptroller shall reduce the amount due each month to such
  city from taxes imposed pursuant to  the  authority  of  section  twelve
  hundred  twelve-A provided for in subdivision (c) of this section by the
  relevant portion of the sales and use tax component for such month equal
  to H; and the comptroller shall instead each month pay such portion into
  the general fund of the state  treasury  to  the  credit  of  the  state
  purposes account therein.
    (iv)  The  comptroller  shall  each month certify to the New York city
  transitional finance authority  the  monthly  amount  of  PIT  and  such
  authority  shall,  after  applying amounts described in section thirteen
  hundred thirteen of this chapter, immediately pay such  monthly  amount,
  or  so  much of which is available after applying such amounts, directly


 and immediately to the  comptroller;  and  the  comptroller  shall  upon
  receipt  of  such  moneys,  subject  to  the  exceptions in such section
  thirteen hundred thirteen, pay them into the general fund of  the  state
  treasury to the credit of the state purposes account therein.
    (4) If for any reason such a city's Medicaid amount in a month (MA) is
  greater than the sum of the amounts of the comptroller's net payments to
  such  city  for  that month under subdivision (c) of this section, under
  section twelve hundred  twelve-A  of  this  article  and  under  section
  thirteen  hundred  thirteen  of  this chapter, after the comptroller has
  made any payments to other entities required by any law  and  after  any
  payment,  deposit,  appropriation,  transfer  or expenditure required or
  authorized by any of such sections, the comptroller shall, at  the  same
  time that the comptroller makes the payments and reductions described in
  paragraph  three  of this subdivision, bill such city an amount equal to
  the difference and such city shall pay in full the amount of  such  bill
  to  the  comptroller  by  the  twenty-fifth day of such month. Such city
  shall use any funds available to it to pay such  bill.  The  comptroller
  shall  deposit  any  such  amounts received into the general fund of the
  state treasury to the credit of the state purposes account therein.
    (5) If such a city does not pay in full a bill described in  paragraph
  four  of  this  subdivision  by  the  twenty-fifth  day  of the month in
  accordance with such paragraph four, the comptroller shall, as  soon  as
  any  other  moneys  payable to the city are available, either deduct any
  amount not paid from the amount of the next payment or payments due such
  city pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, section twelve hundred
  twelve-A of this article or section thirteen hundred  thirteen  of  this
  chapter,  until  such  amount  not  paid  has  been recovered or, in the
  alternative and at the comptroller's discretion, deduct any  amount  not
  paid  from  the amount of any other moneys payable to such city from the
  comptroller and not subject to any lien or pledge  for  the  benefit  of
  bondholders  of  the  transitional finance authority or of the municipal
  assistance corporation, until such amount not paid has  been  recovered.
  The comptroller shall deposit any amounts so deducted and recovered into
  the  general  fund  of  the  state  treasury  to the credit of the state
  purposes account therein.
    (6) This subdivision shall apply to payments required in respect of  a
  city to be made on January twelfth, two thousand eight, and thereafter.
    (7)(A)  If  such  a  city  adopts  or amends a local law, ordinance or
  resolution to repeal  its  sales  and  compensating  use  taxes  imposed
  pursuant  to  the authority of subdivision (a) of section twelve hundred
  ten of this article, then, effective on the first day of the first month
  on which such repeal takes effect, such city's resolution electing to be
  reimbursed for  certain  medical  assistance  expenditures  pursuant  to
  section  two of the chapter of the laws of two thousand five which added
  this subdivision shall also be repealed automatically as of  such  date;
  and  the  commissioner  shall  notify the commissioner of health of such
  city's repeal of such taxes. In that event, as of such date,  such  city
  shall  be  treated as if it had never made such election for purposes of
  such expenditures and such  commissioner  of  health  shall  thenceforth
  compute  the  amount  due  monthly  from such city for such expenditures
  pursuant to section one of such chapter of  the  laws  of  two  thousand
  five.
    (B)  If  such city adopts or amends a local law to repeal its taxes on
  personal income authorized  by  article  thirty  of  this  chapter,  the
  comptroller  shall  bill  such  city  monthly  in the manner provided in
  paragraph four of this  subdivision  for  any  amounts  due  under  this
  subdivision  which  otherwise  would have been paid out of revenues from
  such taxes into the general fund of the state treasury pursuant to  this


 subdivision,  and such bills shall be paid as provided in paragraph four
  of this subdivision and any bill not paid shall be treated  as  provided
  in paragraph five of this subdivision.


   § 1261-a. Revenues from certain taxes imposed by Washington and Warren
  counties.  (a)  In  the  event  that  the  Warren  and Washington county
  industrial development agency established under  article  eighteen-A  of
  the  general  municipal  law  issues  bonds,  notes or other obligations
  secured by the service fee obligations of the counties which,  in  turn,
  are secured by a pledge by Warren and Washington counties of payments of
  net  collections  from  taxes  imposed  by such counties pursuant to the
  authority of subdivision (a) of  section  twelve  hundred  ten  of  this
  article,  as  authorized  by  the  act  which enacted this section, such
  industrial development agency shall provide a certified  written  notice
  to  the state comptroller that it has issued, or is about to issue, such
  notes, bonds or other obligations. Such notice shall set forth in detail
  the term, amount, interest rate and  payment  schedule  of  such  bonds,
  notes  or  other  obligations,  and  the  amounts  due  from each county
  attributable  to  net  collections  from  the  respective  counties,  as
  described  in  subdivision (b) of this section, together with such other
  information as the comptroller shall require. Such agency shall  provide
  a  copy  of such notice to the chief fiscal officer of each such county.
  Such agency shall provide the first of such notices to  the  comptroller
  at  least ninety days prior to the date that the comptroller is expected
  to pay net collections, as described in subdivision (b) of this section,
  and then at least ninety days prior to the beginning  of  each  county's
  fiscal  year  thereafter, until the comptroller is no longer expected to
  make such payments of such net  collections,  provided  that  the  first
  notice  to  the  comptroller under this section may contain estimates of
  the term, amount, interest rate and payment schedules before the  bonds,
  notes  or  other  obligations are issued in which case such agency shall
  give a corrected notice to the comptroller within ten  days  after  such
  bonds,  notes or other obligations are issued. If such agency gives such
  an estimated notice and such bonds, notes or other obligations  are  not
  issued,  such  agency  shall give further notice to the comptroller that
  net collections shall not be withheld from the counties.
    (b) Upon  the  comptroller  receiving  (i)  such  complete,  certified
  written   notice   from  such  agency,  and  (ii)  certified  copies  of
  resolutions adopted by majority vote of the board of supervisors of each
  such county (both and each of such boards  concurring)  authorizing  and
  requesting   the  comptroller  to  make  such  payments  from  such  net
  collections due such counties as the counties have agreed upon with such
  agency, at least ninety days prior to the date that the  comptroller  is
  expected  to  make the first payment under this section, the comptroller
  shall, notwithstanding any provision of section twelve hundred sixty-one
  of this article to the contrary, pay, on or before the fifteenth day  of
  each  month,  all or a portion of the net collections due Warren county,
  but only out of net collections attributable to taxes  imposed  by  such
  county at the rate of one and one half percent pursuant to the authority
  of subdivision (a) of section twelve hundred ten of this article (or, in
  the  event  that Warren county's pledge is substituted, then only out of
  net collections available to such county as a result of such substituted
  pledge, as such substituted pledge and net collections are described  in
  subdivision  i of section one of chapter five hundred one of the laws of
  nineteen hundred ninety-nine, as added by the chapter of the laws of two
  thousand which added this subdivision) and all or a portion of  the  net
  collections  due  Washington county, but only out of the net collections
  attributable to taxes imposed by  such  county  at  the  rate  of  three
  percent  pursuant  to  the  authority of subdivision (a) of such section
  twelve hundred ten, as authorized by such counties' resolutions, to such
  agency, on account of, and for the benefit of,  such  counties  to  meet
  such  counties'  responsibilities under agreements amongst such counties


 and  such  agency  and  the  holders  of  such  bonds,  notes  or  other
  obligations  which  are  subject  to such a pledge, or to the trustee of
  such bonds, notes or other obligations. If  so  requested  by  both  the
  agency,  as  indicated  in  its  notice  to  the comptroller, and by the
  counties, as indicated in their concurring resolutions  filed  with  the
  comptroller,  the  comptroller  shall  make  such  payments to a trustee
  pursuant to an indenture for bondholders or holders of  notes  or  other
  obligations,  issued  by  such  agency  with  respect  to the Adirondack
  resource recovery facility pursuant to the authority of  the  law  which
  enacted this section. Such payments by the comptroller on behalf of such
  counties shall be applied monthly by such agency or, if paid directly to
  the  trustee,  by  such  trustee,  to  pay  the  portion of service fees
  measured by debt service costs or such other or additional  portions  of
  the service fees that the counties shall authorize by resolution of each
  of  their  respective boards of supervisors for solid waste disposal for
  the counties pursuant to agreements entered into or to be  entered  into
  concerning  solid  waste  disposal  fees, which agreements shall require
  such agency or such trustee to electronically transfer the  balances  of
  such  payments  not  required  to  meet  contractual  obligations to the
  respective county on or before the first  day  of  the  next  succeeding
  month.
    (c) The comptroller shall not be responsible for any inaccuracy in the
  amount  of such payments based upon the schedule in the notice furnished
  by such agency. The comptroller shall not be required to  make  payments
  under  this  subdivision  which  are  greater  than  the  amounts of net
  collections due Warren county from its tax imposed at the  rate  of  one
  and  one  half  percent (or, in the event that Warren county's pledge is
  substituted, due such county from its tax as available in the  event  of
  such  substituted pledge, as such substituted pledge and net collections
  are described in subdivision i of section one of  chapter  five  hundred
  one of the laws of nineteen hundred ninety-nine, as added by the chapter
  of  the  laws  of  two  thousand  which  added  this subdivision) or due
  Washington county from its tax imposed at the rate of three percent  and
  available  in the account described in subdivision (c) of section twelve
  hundred sixty-one of this article, as certified to  the  comptroller  by
  the  commissioner  as provided in such subdivision (c) of section twelve
  hundred sixty-one. Any balance of  net  collections  due  such  counties
  after  the  comptroller  makes  any payments required under this section
  shall  be  paid  to  such  counties  in  the  manner  provided  in  such
  subdivision  (c)  of  section  twelve hundred sixty-one. The comptroller
  shall be required to make payments under this section for only  so  long
  as  the  counties  are required to make payments of such net collections
  under the payment schedule set forth in  such  agency's  notice  to  the
  comptroller.
    (d) The comptroller may rely, without further inquiry, that Washington
  county  has  incurred  obligations  to  the  agency,  and  Warren county
  similarly has incurred obligations of Warren county to Washington county
  and/or the agency, and that agreements have been duly  approved  by  the
  board of supervisors for each county and executed by the chairman of the
  board  of supervisors for each county authorizing use of net collections
  as authorized in this section, payable by them, for all or a portion  of
  service  fees  measured by debt service and payments to reserve funds in
  connection with any outstanding bonds, notes or other  obligations  now,
  or  hereafter  issued  by  the  agency  for  such purposes or such other
  portions or additional portions of the service fees  that  the  counties
  shall  authorize  by  resolution  of  each of their respective boards of
  supervisors,  and  arising  out  of  financing  or  refinancing  of  the
  Adirondack  resource  recovery  facility  including the financing of the


 purchase of any rights of  private  parties  to  acquire  such  facility
  through an installment sale.






    § 1262. Disposition of revenues from taxes imposed by cities under one
  million, counties and school districts. (a) Except as otherwise provided
  in  this  article,  the  local law, ordinance or resolution imposing any
  county tax pursuant to this article may set aside for county purposes or
  educational  purposes  all  or  any  portion  of  the  net   collections
  therefrom.  In  the event all or a portion of the net collections are so
  set aside  for  educational  purposes,  the  amounts  thereof  shall  be
  distributed  and  paid  quarterly to the several school districts in the
  county in accordance with the total average  daily  attendance  for  the
  last  preceding  school  year  of  pupils residing in each such district
  (without regard to the  location  of  the  school  attended),  provided,
  however, that in the case of school districts which are partially within
  and  partially without the county, such county shall make a distribution
  to each such school district in accordance with the total average  daily
  attendance  of  the  pupils  in  such school district who reside in such
  county and in any such case, the amount to be raised by school taxes  by
  the  district from the portion of such district within such county shall
  be reduced by the amount so distributed.
    (b) In the county of Monroe amounts not set aside for county  purposes
  shall  be  allocated  quarterly to the city of Rochester and the area in
  the county  outside  the  city  of  Rochester  in  proportion  to  their
  respective populations, determined in accordance with the latest federal
  census  or special population census taken pursuant to section twenty of
  the general municipal law, completed and published prior to the  end  of
  the  quarter for which the allocation is made, which special census must
  include the entire area of the county, provided, however, that a special
  population census shall not be taken more often than once in  every  two
  years.  The  county  legislature  may,  by  resolution adopted annually,
  provide that of the amount so allocated to the area outside the city  of
  Rochester  a portion thereof be allocated and paid to the several school
  districts in such area in accordance with the number  of  public  school
  pupils  residing  in  said  districts  and  enrolled in kindergarten and
  grades one to twelve inclusive at the close  of  the  school  year  next
  preceding the date of the adoption of said resolution. An enrollment for
  a  regular half day session shall be counted as one-half enrollment. The
  location of the school  attended  shall  not  be  considered  except  as
  hereinafter  provided  for  pupils  attending  city  schools without the
  payment of tuition. In the case of school districts which are  partially
  within  and  partially  without the county payment shall be made to each
  such school district in accordance with the enrollment of the pupils  in
  such  school district who reside in such county. In all cases the amount
  to be raised by school taxes  by  the  school  districts  upon  property
  within  the  district  or that portion of the district within the county
  shall be reduced by the amount of tax revenue so received.  Each  school
  district  receiving  said money shall indicate on each individual school
  tax bill the amount of tax proceeds received from the county  of  Monroe
  for  that  fiscal  year.  In  the  case of pupils who reside in the area
  outside the city and who, by law, are attending public  schools  in  the
  city  of  Rochester  without payment of tuition, the distribution of tax
  revenue based on the enrollment of those pupils shall  be  paid  to  the
  city  of Rochester. The amount allocated to the area outside the city of
  Rochester, less the  amount,  if  any,  so  distributed  to  the  school
  districts  and  paid to the city of Rochester as above provided, and the
  amount allocated to the city of Rochester shall be applied  as  provided
  for   by  subdivision  (c)  of  this  section  except  that  the  county
  legislature may provide by resolution that where any village  elects  to
  have  the amount which would otherwise be applied to reduce county taxes
  and general town taxes upon real property in such village paid  directly


 to such village in lieu of such tax reduction, the portion of the amount
  allocated,  pursuant  to subdivision (c) of this section, to the town in
  which such village is wholly or partly situated  which  is  to  be  paid
  directly  to  such  village  shall  be determined by the ratio which the
  population of such village, or portion thereof within the town, bears to
  the population of the entire town, determined  in  accordance  with  the
  latest  federal  census  or  special population census taken pursuant to
  section twenty of the general municipal  law,  completed  and  published
  prior  to the end of the quarter for which the allocation is made, which
  special census must include the  entire  area  of  the  town.  Provided,
  however,  in  determining  such  portion  to  be  paid  directly to such
  village, such population ratio may be applied to no more  than  one-half
  of the amount allocated to such town pursuant to subdivision (c) of this
  section. Provided, further, that any resolution so enacted by the county
  legislature  shall  only  be  effective  for  the calendar year or years
  subsequent to its enactment and such resolution must be  enacted  before
  the  first  day  of  October  preceding  the  calendar  year to which it
  applies. Such resolution shall remain in effect for subsequent  calendar
  years unless rescinded by a resolution, but the enactment which rescinds
  it  must  be  enacted  prior  to  the first day of October preceding the
  calendar year for which the rescission is to apply.
    (c) Amounts not set aside for county purposes or educational  purposes
  shall,  except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  section, be allocated
  quarterly to the cities and the area in the county outside the cities in
  proportion to their respective  populations,  determined  in  accordance
  with  the  latest  decennial federal census or special population census
  taken pursuant to section twenty of the general municipal law  completed
  and  published  prior to the end of the quarter for which the allocation
  is made, which special census  must  include  the  entire  area  of  the
  county,  or  in  such  other  proportion  as  may  be agreed upon by the
  elective governing body of the county and of each of the cities  in  the
  county  with  the  approval  of the state comptroller, provided however,
  that where a county does not contain a city, such amounts  shall  be  so
  allocated  to  the  entire  area  of  the  county. Any such agreement or
  approval thereof may be for a limited period. The amount so allocated to
  the area outside the cities, or to the entire area of the  county  where
  the  county  does  not  contain a city, shall be applied first to reduce
  county taxes levied upon real property in  the  several  towns  in  such
  area. Any balance remaining shall then be applied to reduce general town
  taxes  levied upon real property in such area. In a county having a city
  wholly  contained  therein  having  more  than  four  hundred   thousand
  inhabitants according to the latest federal or special population census
  referred  to  above, if any town, by local law, ordinance, or resolution
  shall so provide, all or part of such amount shall be paid  directly  to
  such town and shall be applied first to reduce general town taxes levied
  upon real property in the town. Any balance remaining shall then be used
  to  reduce county taxes levied upon real property in the town. Any town,
  other than a town within a county having a population of one million  or
  more  and  containing  not  more  than three towns, or other than a town
  within a county having a population  of  not  less  than  seven  hundred
  thousand or more than eight hundred thousand, by local law, ordinance or
  resolution,  however,  may provide that all or any specified part of the
  amounts which would be so applied to reduce the county taxes and general
  town taxes levied upon real property in such town shall be paid directly
  to such town to be used for any town purpose. If any village, other than
  a village within a county having a population of one million or more and
  containing not more  than  three  towns,  by  local  law,  ordinance  or
  resolution  shall  so  provide, the amounts which would be so applied to


 reduce the county and general town taxes levied upon  real  property  in
  such  village shall be paid directly to such village in lieu of such tax
  reduction. Where any village has elected to be paid directly as provided
  in  this  subdivision,  the  amount  to be paid to such village shall be
  determined by the ratio that the full valuation of real property in  the
  village  or  portion  thereof  within  the town in which such village is
  located bears to the full valuation of real property in the entire town.
  If a village wholly or partially within a town has so elected to be paid
  directly, but the town in which such  village  is  located  has  not  so
  elected,  the  amount  allocated  to  the  town in which such village is
  wholly or partially situated shall be applied to reduce county taxes and
  general town taxes in the area of the town outside such village. If  the
  amount  allocated  to  a town exceeds the amount of the county taxes and
  general town taxes levied upon real property in  the  town,  the  excess
  shall  be  apportioned between the town and each village, if any, wholly
  or partially situated therein, in the ratios that the full valuation  of
  real  property  in each such village or portion thereof within the town,
  and the full valuation of real property  in  the  portion  of  the  town
  outside of such village or villages, respectively, bear to the aggregate
  full  valuation of the entire town. The share of each such village shall
  be paid directly to such  village.  The  share  of  the  town  shall  be
  applied, first, to reduce taxes levied for part-town activities, and any
  balance  remaining  shall  be paid directly to the town, to be used only
  for part-town activities. If a town and all the villages  therein  shall
  have  elected  to  be paid directly as provided in this subdivision, the
  share of such town shall be applied to reduce taxes levied for part-town
  activities, and  any  balance  remaining  or  portion  thereof,  in  the
  discretion  of  the  town  board,  may be applied to reduce general town
  taxes, county taxes levied in the area  of  the  town  outside  of  such
  villages  or  may  be  used for part-town activities, or any combination
  thereof. If a town containing more than one village shall  have  elected
  to  be  paid  directly and one or more but not all of the villages shall
  have also elected to be paid directly, the share of the  town  shall  be
  applied  to  reduce  general  town  taxes levied in the area of the town
  outside of the village or villages that have so elected, and any balance
  remaining or portion thereof, in the discretion of the town  board,  may
  be applied to reduce county taxes levied in the area of the town outside
  of  such  village  or villages. The amount to be applied in reduction of
  county taxes and general town taxes in each town may  be  determined  on
  the basis of the ratio which the full valuation of real property in each
  town  bears  to  the aggregate full valuation of real property in all of
  the towns in such county. The amount allocated to  each  city  shall  be
  similarly  applied to reduce the county tax levied upon real property in
  such city, except that if any such city, except a city within  a  single
  county  having  a  population  of one million or more and containing not
  more than three towns, by local law, ordinance or  resolution  shall  so
  provide,  the  amount which would be so applied to reduce the county tax
  levied upon real property in such city shall be  paid  directly  to  the
  city  in  lieu  of such tax reduction. If the amount allocated to a city
  exceeds the amount of the county tax levied upon real property  in  such
  city, such excess shall be paid to such city.
    Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, where a
  municipal  assistance  corporation has been created under article ten of
  the public authorities law for a city located in a  county,  any  amount
  which such county allocates to such city under this subdivision shall be
  payable  directly to such city and shall not be provided by reduction of
  the county tax levied upon real property in such city  for  so  long  as
  such municipal assistance corporation shall exist.


   In  the  alternative,  the amount to be applied in reduction of county
  taxes and general town taxes in each town may be determined on the basis
  of the respective populations of  the  several  towns  in  such  county,
  determined  in  accordance  with  the  latest  federal census or special
  population  census  taken  pursuant  to  section  twenty  of the general
  municipal law, completed and published prior to the end of  the  quarter
  for  which the allocation is made, which special census must include the
  entire area of the county.
    Any local law, ordinance or resolution enacted  by  a  city,  town  or
  village  pursuant  to  this  subdivision shall only be effective for the
  calendar year or years subsequent to its enactment and,  further,  shall
  only be effective if it is mailed by registered or certified mail to the
  chief fiscal officer of the county in which the city, town or village is
  located  before  the  first day of September preceding the calendar year
  for which  the  election  is  made  by  such  local  law,  ordinance  or
  resolution.  Such  local  law,  ordinance  or resolution shall remain in
  effect for subsequent calendar  years  until  rescinded  by  local  law,
  ordinance  or  resolution,  but the enactment shall rescind the election
  only if it is mailed, in the same manner already provided  for  in  this
  subdivision,  to  the  chief  fiscal  officer of the county in which the
  city, town or village is located  before  the  first  day  of  September
  preceding  the  calendar  year for which the rescission is to apply. The
  foregoing provisions of this paragraph notwithstanding, where  a  county
  imposes a sales and use tax to be effective on a date after the adoption
  of  its budget but within the fiscal year for which such budget has been
  adopted, and the estimated revenues from such tax include an amount  not
  set  aside  for county purposes or educational purposes, and such amount
  has not been included in  budget  revenues  for  such  fiscal  year  for
  allocation  in  reduction  of taxes on real property as provided in this
  subdivision, a local law, ordinance or resolution  enacted  by  a  city,
  town  or  village  pursuant to this subdivision shall be effective as of
  the effective date of such tax if mailed by registered or certified mail
  to the chief fiscal officer of the county in which  the  city,  town  or
  village  is located within thirty days after the enactment by the county
  of the local law, ordinance or resolution imposing such tax.
    The foregoing provisions of this subdivision notwithstanding,  in  the
  county  of Orange where any village within such county has elected to be
  paid directly as provided in this subdivision, the amount to be paid  to
  such  village  shall  be  determined by the ratio that the population of
  such village or portion thereof within the town in which such village is
  located bears to the total population of the entire  town,  except  that
  this  provision  shall  not  apply  to the village of Highland Falls for
  which the amount to  be  paid  shall  be  determined  by  the  foregoing
  provisions  of  this  subdivision. The population shall be determined in
  accordance with the latest federal census or special  population  census
  taken pursuant to section twenty of the general municipal law, completed
  and  published  prior to the end of the quarter for which the allocation
  is made, which special census must  include  the  entire  area  of  such
  county.
    The  foregoing  provisions of this subdivision notwithstanding, in the
  county of  Monroe,  beginning  in  nineteen  hundred  ninety-six,  towns
  located  within  the  county shall be paid directly that part of the net
  collections for the quarterly allocations which  are  determined  to  be
  allocable  to  such  towns  and  are in excess of thirteen million seven
  hundred fifty thousand dollars (fifty-five million dollars annually, the
  "base amount"), if any, derived solely from the imposition of sales  and
  compensating  use  taxes  by  the  county  at  the  three  percent  rate
  authorized by the opening paragraph of section  twelve  hundred  ten  of


 this article, which would otherwise be so applied to reduce county taxes
  and  general  town  taxes  levied  upon  real  property  in  such towns,
  provided, however, if the annual allocation to such towns is  less  than
  the  base  amount,  a sum equal to the difference between the allocation
  and the base amount shall be deducted  from  the  immediately  following
  payment  or  payments  to  be made directly to such towns as required to
  satisfy such sum in  full,  and  provided  further,  however,  that  any
  adjustments  necessary  to  reconcile  the amounts applied to reduce the
  county taxes and general town taxes levied upon  real  property  in  the
  towns  for  the  years nineteen hundred ninety-four and nineteen hundred
  ninety-five to the actual allocations to the towns for such years  shall
  be  made  against  the  amounts  to  be  paid  to the towns in the years
  nineteen hundred ninety-seven and thereafter.  In  the  event  that  the
  annual  allocation  to  such  towns  is less than the base amount for at
  least two consecutive years, a sum equal to the difference  between  the
  allocation and the base amount shall be deducted from the amount applied
  to  reduce county taxes and general town taxes levied upon real property
  in such towns in the year or  years  following  such  consecutive  years
  until  the  annual allocation to such towns exceeds the base amount, the
  foregoing  provisions   of   this   subdivision   or   any   other   law
  notwithstanding.  If  the  state reduces the rate of taxation authorized
  for Monroe county by section twelve  hundred  ten  of  this  article  or
  reduces  the  amount  distributed by the state to Monroe county from the
  taxes, penalties and interest imposed by Monroe county pursuant to  this
  article, the county shall have the right to adjust the amount applied to
  reduce  county taxes and general town taxes levied upon real property in
  subsequent years.
    (d) (1) Where a county and a city therein both impose the  same  taxes
  described in sections twelve hundred two, twelve hundred three or twelve
  hundred ten, the county shall have power to impose or continue to impose
  such taxes on the area of the county outside such city up to the maximum
  rate  authorized  therefor.  In  such  event,  the  portion  of  the net
  collections received by the county by reason of its additional  rate  on
  such  area, shall be allocated quarterly to the several cities and towns
  in such area on the basis of the ratio which the full valuation of  real
  property  in  each city or town bears to the aggregate full valuation of
  real property in all of the cities and  towns  in  such  area  provided,
  however,  that,  in  such  event, in Niagara county, such portion of net
  collections received by Niagara county shall be allocated  quarterly  to
  the  several  cities  and  towns  in such area on the basis of the ratio
  which the population of  each  city  or  town  bears  to  the  aggregate
  population of all of the cities and towns in such area, such populations
  determined  in  accordance  with  the latest decennial federal census or
  special population census  taken  pursuant  to  section  twenty  of  the
  general  municipal  law  completed and published prior to the end of the
  quarter for which the allocation is  made,  which  special  census  must
  include the entire area of the county. The amount allocated to each town
  shall  be applied first to reduce county taxes levied upon real property
  in such town and any  balance  remaining  shall  be  applied  to  reduce
  general  town taxes levied upon real estate; provided, however, that any
  town or village other than any town or village within a county having  a
  population  of  one  million  or more and containing not more than three
  towns, shall have power, in the manner provided in  subdivision  (c)  of
  this  section, to elect to receive a direct payment of the amounts which
  would be so applied to reduce county taxes and general town taxes levied
  upon real property in such  town  or  village.  Where  any  village  has
  elected  to be paid directly as provided in this subdivision, the amount
  to be paid to such village shall be determined by  the  ratio  that  the


 full valuation of real property in the village or portion thereof within
  the town in which such village is located bears to the full valuation of
  real  property  in  the  entire  town.  If a village wholly or partially
  within  a town has so elected to be paid directly, but the town in which
  such village is located has not so elected, the amount allocated to  the
  town  in  which  such  village  is wholly or partially situated shall be
  applied to reduce county taxes and general town taxes in the area of the
  town outside such village or villages. If the amount allocated to a town
  exceeds the amount of the county taxes and  general  town  taxes  levied
  upon  real property in the town, the excess shall be apportioned between
  the town and each village, if any, wholly or partially situated therein,
  and paid over or applied in the manner provided in  subdivision  (c)  of
  this  section.  The  amount allocated to each city in such area shall be
  similarly applied to reduce county taxes levied upon  real  property  in
  such  city, except that if any such city except any city within a single
  county having a population of one million or more and containing no more
  than three towns, shall so provide in the manner provided in subdivision
  (c) of this section, the amount which would  be  so  applied  to  reduce
  county  taxes  levied  upon  real  property  in  such city shall be paid
  directly to the city in lieu  of  such  tax  reduction.  If  the  amount
  allocated  to  the city exceeds the amount of the county tax levied upon
  real property in the city, such excess shall be paid to the city.
    Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, where a
  municipal assistance corporation has been created under article  ten  of
  the  public  authorities  law for a city located in a county, any amount
  which such county allocates to such city under this subdivision shall be
  payable directly to such city and shall not be provided by reduction  of
  the  county  tax  levied  upon real property in such city for so long as
  such municipal assistance corporation shall exist.
    Any local law, ordinance or resolution enacted  by  a  city,  town  or
  village  pursuant  to  this  subdivision shall only be effective for the
  calendar year or years subsequent to its enactment and,  further,  shall
  only be effective if it is mailed by registered or certified mail to the
  chief fiscal officer of the county in which the city, town or village is
  located  before  the  first day of September preceding the calendar year
  for which  the  election  is  made  by  such  local  law,  ordinance  or
  resolution.  Such  local  law,  ordinance  or resolution shall remain in
  effect for subsequent calendar  years  until  rescinded  by  local  law,
  ordinance  or  resolution,  but the enactment shall rescind the election
  only if it is mailed, in the same manner already provided  for  in  this
  subdivision,  to  the  chief  fiscal  officer of the county in which the
  city, town or village is located  before  the  first  day  of  September
  preceding  the  calendar  year  for  which  the rescission to apply. The
  foregoing provisions of this paragraph notwithstanding, where  a  county
  imposes a sales and use tax to be effective on a date after the adoption
  of  its budget but within the fiscal year for which such budget has been
  adopted,  and  the  estimated  revenues  from  such  tax   include   net
  collections  received  by the county by reason of its additional rate on
  the area of the county outside a city imposing the same taxes, and  such
  net  collections  have  not  been  included  in budget revenues for such
  fiscal year for allocation in reduction of taxes  on  real  property  as
  provided  in  this  subdivision,  a  local  law, ordinance or resolution
  enacted by a city, town or village pursuant to this subdivision shall be
  effective as of the effective date of such tax if mailed  by  registered
  or certified mail to the chief fiscal officer of the county in which the
  city,  town or village is located within thirty days after the enactment
  by the county of the local law, ordinance or  resolution  imposing  such
  tax.


   (2)  Notwithstanding any provision of general, special or local law to
  the contrary, if at any time from the  effective  date  of  the  Buffalo
  fiscal  stability  authority  act  until  June  thirtieth,  two thousand
  thirty-seven  any  city  in  the  county  of  Erie  imposes  sales   and
  compensating  use  taxes described in section twelve hundred ten of this
  article, then the county of Erie shall not be required to allocate under
  paragraph one of this subdivision, any net collections  from  its  taxes
  imposed  during  such  period; instead it shall continue to allocate net
  collections from its taxes to any city in  the  county  which  does  not
  impose  such  taxes and to the area of the county outside the cities, in
  accordance with the terms of  the  most  current  agreement  among  such
  county and the cities in the county entered into pursuant to subdivision
  (c) of this section.
    (3)  Notwithstanding any provision of general, special or local law to
  the contrary, if at any time from the effective date of the Erie  county
  fiscal stability authority act until December thirty-first, two thousand
  thirty-nine,   any  city  in  the  county  of  Erie  imposes  sales  and
  compensating use taxes described in section twelve hundred ten  of  this
  article, then the county of Erie shall not be required to allocate under
  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision any net collections from its taxes
  imposed during such period; instead it shall continue  to  allocate  net
  collections  from  its  taxes  to  any city in the county which does not
  impose such taxes and to the area of the county outside the  cities,  in
  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  most current agreement among such
  county and the cities in the county entered into pursuant to subdivision
  (c) of this section.
    (4) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, for purposes
  of this subdivision, a county and a city in such  county  shall  not  be
  deemed  to  impose  different  taxes  because  one  makes  the  election
  described in subdivision (m) of section eleven hundred  eleven  of  this
  chapter and the other does not make such election.
    (e)  Where  all or a portion of the net collections from a tax imposed
  by a county pursuant to  this  article  is  set  aside  for  educational
  purposes  or for allocation and distribution to the cities in the county
  and to the area outside the cities, or both, or where a tax or taxes are
  imposed pursuant to section twelve hundred  four  of  this  article  for
  educational  purposes,  the portion of net collections so set aside by a
  county shall not be decreased or eliminated nor shall a tax  so  imposed
  by  a  city  be eliminated unless the local law, ordinance or resolution
  effectuating such decrease or elimination is adopted by  the  county  or
  city  and  written  notice  of  such  adoption  is  given  to the school
  authorities of the school districts and  the  governing  bodies  of  the
  cities,  towns or villages affected thereby at least six months prior to
  the  commencement  of  their  respective  fiscal   years.   The   school
  authorities  of  such  a  school  district or the governing body of such
  city, town or village may waive the requirement  that  such  local  law,
  ordinance or resolution be so adopted and such written notice given.
    (f) As used in this article the following terms shall mean or include:
    (1)  Net collections. The moneys collected from a tax or taxes imposed
  pursuant  to  this  article,  after  deducting  therefrom  expenses   of
  administration and collection and amounts refunded or to be refunded.
    (2)  General  Town taxes. Taxes levied for any town purpose, including
  highways, upon the entire area of a town.
    (3) Full valuation of real property. The assessed  valuation  of  real

  with article eight of the real property tax law.
    (4) Part-town activities. Activities  of  town  government,  including
  highway  programs,  which are chargeable to the area of the town outside


 of villages, exclusive of special district purposes, unless such special
  district is a fire protection district coterminous with the  area  of  a
  town outside of villages.




   § 1262-a. Sales tax; Tompkins county. (a) In the event that the county
  of  Tompkins and the city of Ithaca both impose the same taxes described
  in section twelve hundred two, twelve hundred three  or  twelve  hundred
  ten  of  this chapter, the county shall have power to impose or continue
  to impose such taxes on the area of the county outside such city  up  to
  the maximum rate authorized therefor. In such event, notwithstanding the
  provisions  of the preceding section, the portion of the net collections
  received by the county by reason of its additional rate  on  such  area,
  shall  be allocated quarterly to the towns in such area in proportion to
  their respective  populations,  and  allocated  between  the  towns  and
  villages, if any village elects to take its share in cash, in proportion
  to  their  respective  populations,  determined  in  accordance with the
  latest decennial federal  census  or  special  population  census  taken
  pursuant  to  section  twenty of the general municipal law completed and
  published prior to the end of the quarter for which  the  allocation  is
  made.
    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if the
  county  of  Tompkins imposes the additional one-half or one percent rate
  of tax pursuant to the provisions of section twelve hundred ten of  this
  article,  the  net  collections  received  by  the county of Tompkins on
  account of such  additional  rate  during  the  first  six  months  such
  additional rate is in effect shall be retained by the county of Tompkins
  to  be  used for any county purpose. Thereafter, seventy-five per centum
  of net  collections  attributable  to  such  additional  rate  shall  be
  retained  by  the county of Tompkins, to be used for any county purpose,
  and the remaining twenty-five per centum of such net  collections  shall
  be allocated as follows:
    (1)  Where  the city of Ithaca imposes a tax pursuant to the authority
  of subdivision (a) of section one  thousand  two  hundred  ten  of  this
  article,  that  portion  received  by  the  county  on  account  of  the
  additional tax imposed by the county within the city of Ithaca shall  be
  allocated  to  the city of Ithaca to be used for any city purpose. Where
  the city of Ithaca does not impose a tax pursuant to  the  authority  of
  such  subdivision (a) of section one thousand two hundred ten the amount
  required to be allocated to such city, to be used for any city  purpose,
  shall  be  determined in proportion to such city's population determined
  as  a  portion  of  the  county's  total  population  as  determined  in
  accordance   with   the  latest  decennial  federal  census  or  special
  population census taken  pursuant  to  section  twenty  of  the  general
  municipal  law  completed  and published prior to the end of the quarter
  for which the allocation is made.
    (2) The balance of such twenty-five per centum, after deduction of the
  amount allocated to the city of Ithaca pursuant to paragraph one of this
  subdivision, shall be allocated to the towns of such county, and between
  towns and villages, if any village elects to take its share in cash,  in
  the  manner described in subdivision (a) of this section with respect to
  the area of the county outside the city of Ithaca.






	   * §  1262-b.  The  Westchester  county  property tax stabilization and
  relief act. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the  contrary:
  (a)  If  the  county  of  Westchester imposes sales and compensating use
  taxes pursuant to subdivision (a) of section twelve hundred ten of  this
  article at the rate of three percent:
    (1)  The  county  shall allocate one-half of net collections from such
  taxes imposed pursuant to subdivision (a) of section twelve hundred  ten
  of  this  article countywide among the cities and towns of the county on
  the basis of the ratio which the full valuation of real property in each
  city or town bears to the aggregate full valuation of real  property  in
  all  cities  and  towns  of  the  county.  Amounts so allocated shall be
  credited to each of said cities  and  towns  against  the  county  taxes
  levied upon real property in said cities and towns.
    (2)  The  county  shall  allocate  and  credit or pay one-third of net
  collections from such taxes  imposed  pursuant  to  subdivision  (a)  of
  section  twelve  hundred  ten  of this article to the area of the county
  outside any city imposing sales and compensating use taxes at a rate  of
  one  and  one-half  percent  or  greater  pursuant  to  the authority of
  subdivision (a) or at any rate pursuant to the authority of  subdivision
  (b) of section twelve hundred ten of this article as follows:
    (A)  One-third of such net collections shall be allocated and credited
  in the manner set forth in paragraph one of this subdivision.
    (B) One-sixth of such net collections  shall  be  allocated  and  paid
  quarterly by the county commissioner of finance, in cash, to the several
  school  districts  in  such  area  of  the  county outside any such city
  imposing sales and compensating use taxes. Such allocation and  payment,
  to  such  several  school  districts,  shall be made on the basis of the
  ratio which the population of each such school  district  bears  to  the
  aggregate population of all of the school districts in such area. In the
  case  of  school  districts  which  are  partially  within and partially
  without the county, or partially within or partially without the area of
  the county outside a city imposing sales and compensating use taxes, the
  allocation and payment to each such school district shall be made on the
  basis of the population in such school district in  the  county,  or  in
  such  area  of the county outside a city imposing sales and compensating
  use taxes, as the case may be. Such populations shall be  determined  in
  accordance  with  the latest federal census or special population census
  under  section  twenty  of  the  general  municipal  law  completed  and
  published  prior  to the end of the quarter in which such allocation and
  payment are made, which special  population  census  shall  include  the
  entire  area of the county; provided that such special population census
  shall not be taken more than once in every two years. A school  district
  split  between  Westchester  county  and another county shall apply such
  allocation and payment solely to the benefit of  the  residents  of  the
  county in which the sales and compensating use taxes are imposed.
    (C)  One-half  of  such  net  collections  shall be allocated and paid
  quarterly by the county commissioner of finance, in cash, to the  cities
  not  imposing  sales  and  compensating  use  taxes and to the towns and
  villages on which such rate is imposed, on the basis of the ratio  which
  the  population of each such city, town or village on which such rate is
  imposed bears to the entire population of all  such  cities,  towns  and
  villages  in  the  area  on which such rate is imposed. Such populations
  shall be determined in accordance with  the  latest  federal  census  or
  special  population census under section twenty of the general municipal
  law completed and published prior to the end of  the  quarter  in  which
  such  allocation  is made, which special population census shall include
  the entire area of the county; provided  that  such  special  population
  census shall not be taken more than once in every two years.


   (D)  The  quarterly  allocation  and payment of cash to cities, towns,
  villages and school districts provided  for  under  this  paragraph  and
  under  paragraph  three of this subdivision and under subdivision (b) of
  this section may be made after payment by the state comptroller  to  the
  county  of the net collections subject to such allocation and receipt by
  the county commissioner of finance of the  quarterly  settlement  report
  issued  by  the  department, and may include adjustments for corrections
  applicable to such allocations. All ratios  established  by  the  county
  commissioner  of  finance  with respect to allocations to cities, towns,
  villages  and  school  districts  under  this  subdivision   and   under
  subdivision (b) of this section shall be carried to four decimal places.
  The allocation of net collections and payment of cash provided for under
  this  paragraph  and under paragraph three of this subdivision and under
  subdivision (b) of this section shall be made to a town based  upon  the
  population  of  the  town  less  the  population of any village therein,
  provided that a town/village or village/town shall be deemed  a  village
  for  the  purpose  of determining such allocation. The allocation of net
  collections and payment of cash provided for under  this  paragraph  and
  under  paragraph  three of this subdivision and under subdivision (b) of
  this section shall be applied by the cities, towns, villages and  school
  districts  receiving such allocation and payment as a credit against the
  taxes upon real property  imposed  by  such  municipalities  and  school
  districts,  respectively.  The  allocation and payment received by towns
  shall be credited against real property taxes in either the general fund
  town-wide or the town outside village fund or a combination thereof.
    (3) The county shall allocate and  credit  or  pay  one-sixth  of  net
  collections  from  such  taxes  imposed  pursuant  to subdivision (a) of
  section twelve hundred ten of this article to the  area  of  the  county
  outside  any city imposing sales and compensating use taxes at a rate of
  one and one-half  percent  or  greater  pursuant  to  the  authority  of
  subdivision  (a) or at any rate pursuant to the authority of subdivision
  (b) of section twelve hundred ten of this article as follows:
    (A) Seventy percent of such net collections shall be retained  by  the
  county to be used for any county purpose.
    (B) Ten percent of such net collections shall be allocated and paid in
  the  manner  set  forth  in  subparagraph  (B)  of paragraph two of this
  subdivision.
    (C) Twenty percent of such net collections shall be allocated and paid
  in the manner set forth in subparagraph (C) of  paragraph  two  of  this
  subdivision.
    (b)  If  the  county of Westchester imposes the additional one percent
  rate of sales and compensating use tax authorized by clause forty-two of
  subparagraph (i) of the opening paragraph of section twelve hundred  ten
  of  this  article,  the  county  shall  allocate  and  credit or pay net
  collections from such additional one percent  rate  in  the  manner  set
  forth in paragraph three of subdivision (a) of this section with respect
  to  the  area  of  the  county  outside  any  city  imposing  sales  and
  compensating use taxes at a rate of one and one-half percent or  greater
  pursuant  to  the authority of subdivision (a) of section twelve hundred
  ten of this article  or  at  any  rate  pursuant  to  the  authority  of
  subdivision (b) of section twelve hundred ten of this article.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair the powers of
  a  city  currently imposing sales and compensating use taxes pursuant to
  the authority of  section  twelve  hundred  ten  of  this  article  from
  continuing  to  do  so in accordance with law. No school district in any
  city imposing such sales and compensating use taxes shall be entitled to
  receive a cash allocation and payment under paragraph two  or  three  of
  subdivision  (a) or under subdivision (b) of this section. No city, town


 or village  authorized  or  entitled  to  receive  an  allocation  under
  subparagraph (C) of paragraph two or subparagraph (C) of paragraph three
  of  subdivision  (a)  or  under subdivision (b) of this section shall be
  authorized  or  entitled  to  receive  any cash allocation under section
  twelve hundred sixty-two of this article.

   §  1262-c.  Allocation of revenue from sales and use taxes to villages
  wholly or partially contained within Broome county. Notwithstanding  any
  other  provision  of the tax law to the contrary, the county legislature
  of Broome county shall have the authority to adopt a method for dividing
  the sales and use tax revenues allocated to a town between  any  village
  or  villages located wholly or partially within the town and to the area

   §  1262-d.  Allocation and distribution of revenues from sales and use
  taxes to villages within the county of Albany. Notwithstanding any other
  provision of this chapter to the contrary, the net  collections  from  a
  tax  imposed  by  Albany  county  pursuant to this article set aside for
  allocation and distribution to the towns and villages therein  shall  be
  distributed  between  such towns and villages where any such village has
  elected or hereafter elects to take  its  share  in  cash,  directly  in
  proportion to their respective populations determined in accordance with
  the  latest  decennial federal census or special population census taken
  pursuant to section twenty of the general municipal  law  completed  and
  published  prior  to  the end of the quarter for which the allocation is
  made, which special census must include the entire area of  the  county,
  except  that in the towns of Colonie and Coeymans, the amount to be paid
  to each village therein shall be determined by the ratio that  the  full
  valuation  of  real property in each such village within said town bears
  to the full valuation of real property in the entire town as  set  forth
  in  subdivision (c) of section twelve hundred sixty-two of this chapter;
  provided, however, that  commencing  with  the  July,  nineteen  hundred
  eighty-one  quarterly distribution, one-eighth of the amount of such net
  collections allocated to the town of Colonie and each successive quarter
  thereafter, cumulatively, an additional one-eighth  part  of  each  such
  quarterly  town  allocation shall be distributed between such village or
  villages and the town of Colonie in proportion to their respective  full
  valuations  of  real  property,  with  the  remainder  of each such town
  quarterly  allocation  through  and  including  that  distributable   in
  January,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-three,  being  an  evenly  declining
  portion  of  each  such  quarterly  allocation,  to  be  distributed  in
  proportion  to population as hereinbefore set forth for the remainder of
  Albany  county,  so  that  the  April,  nineteen  hundred   eighty-three
  quarterly  allocation  to  the  town  of  Colonie  and those allocations

  agreement.  A city, town or village which  disagrees  with  such  review
  board  over  the  adjusted  full value of such a parcel of wholly exempt
  real property located in such municipality  may,  at  its  own  expense,
  obtain  two  independent appraisals of the full value of such parcel; in
  which case the average of such board's adjusted  value  and  two  values

  resolution  to  a  specified purpose or purposes, shall be available for
  any county, city or village purpose of such  county,  city  or  village.
  Expenditures  from  the proceeds of any such tax shall not be considered

  applicable to such county, city or village.




   §  1264.  References  to  certain taxes or revenues from certain taxes
  administered by the commissioner. Notwithstanding any provision of  this
  article  or  other  law to the contrary: where a section of subpart B of
  part one of this article or a local law, ordinance or resolution adopted
  pursuant to the authority of such subpart B or an agreement described in

  any such reference expressed as a percentage of the rate  imposed  as  a
  percentage  or  as  a percentage of such revenues or net collections, or
  the like, shall be deemed also to refer to such tax or taxes imposed  on
  such  fuels at a rate of cents per gallon; and any such amount expressed
  as a percentage shall be  calculated  in  a  like  manner  as  an  equal
  fraction  of  such  tax  on  such  fuels  imposed at a rate of cents per
  gallon.

	   §  1281.  Imposition  of  tax. In addition to any other tax imposed by
  this chapter or other law, there is  hereby  imposed  on  every  taxicab
  owner a tax of fifty cents per taxicab trip and on every HAIL base a tax
  of  fifty  cents  per  HAIL  vehicle trip provided by every HAIL vehicle
  affiliated with the base, on every trip that originates in the city  and
  terminates anywhere within the territorial boundaries of the MCTD.




   §  1282.  Presumption  of  taxability.  For  the purpose of the proper
  administration of this article and to prevent evasion of the tax imposed
  by this article, it shall be presumed that every taxicab trip and  every
  HAIL  vehicle  trip  that  originates  in the city is subject to the tax
  imposed by this  article.  This  presumption  shall  prevail  until  the
  contrary  is  proven, and the burden of proving the contrary shall be on
  the person liable for tax.




   §  1283.  Liability  for  tax; special provisions. Notwithstanding any
  provision of law to the contrary: (a) The taxicab owner or HAIL base, as
  the case may be, shall be liable for the tax imposed by this article.
    (b) (1) If the taxicab owner has designated an agent, then  the  agent
  shall  be  jointly  liable  with  the taxicab owner for the tax on trips
  occurring during the period that such designation is in effect. Even  if
  the  TLC  has specified that the taxicab owner's agent cannot operate as
  an agent, that agent shall be jointly liable with the taxicab  owner  if
  the  agent  has  acted  for  the taxicab owner. During the period that a
  taxicab owner's designation of an agent is in effect,  the  agent  shall
  file  the returns required by this article and pay any tax due with such
  return, but the taxicab owner shall not be  relieved  of  liability  for
  tax,  penalty  or  interest due under this article, or for the filing of
  returns required to be filed, unless the agent has timely filed accurate
  returns and timely paid the tax required to be paid under this  article.
  If  a taxicab owner has designated an agent, then the agent must perform
  any act this article requires the taxicab  owner  to  perform,  but  the
  failure  of  such  agent  to  perform any such act shall not relieve the
  taxicab owner from the obligation  to  perform  such  act  or  from  any
  liability that may arise from failure to perform the act.
    (2)  (A)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, a TSP that collects the trip
  record and the trip fare on behalf of a taxicab owner or a HAIL  vehicle
  owner shall withhold from daily collections the taxes due on such trips,
  and shall withhold from such collections the taxes due on cash trips. If
  the  TSP's  daily  collections,  after retaining any fees to which it is
  entitled pursuant to a contract with such taxicab owner or HAIL  vehicle
  owner,  are  insufficient to cover the taxes due on such cash trips, the
  TSP shall withhold an amount from subsequent daily collections,  to  the
  extent  funds  are available, until all taxes due for a quarterly period
  described in section twelve hundred eighty-four  of  this  article  have
  been  withheld. If a TSP is unable to withhold all the taxes due in such
  quarterly period, it shall withhold such  unwithheld  taxes  from  daily
  collections  in the next quarterly period. A TSP shall be jointly liable
  for the tax due on all trips for which it collects the trip record,  but
  shall  be relieved of liability for any taxes attributable to cash trips
  for which it was unable to withhold the  taxes  due  because  there  was
  insufficient daily collections during four successive quarterly periods.
    (B)  For  any period that the TSP collects trip records on behalf of a
  taxicab owner  or  HAIL  vehicle  owner,  the  TSP  shall  file  returns
  reporting  the  tax due on all trips for which it collected trip records
  and shall remit the taxes withheld on all such trips  and  shall  report
  any  unwithheld  taxes  due because of insufficient daily collections to
  cover the taxes due on cash trips.
    (c) (1) Although the tax is imposed on the taxicab owner or  the  HAIL
  base, the city or the TLC shall adopt or amend ordinances or regulations
  to  ensure  that  the economic incidence of the tax is passed through to
  passengers, such as by increasing taxicab or HAIL  vehicle  trip  fares.
  The passing along of such economic incidence may not be construed by any
  court  or  administrative  body  as imposing the tax on any person other
  than the taxicab owner or the HAIL base. The city or the TLC must adjust
  trip fares to include therein the pass-through of the economic incidence
  of the tax imposed by this article, as the rate of  such  tax  may  from
  time  to  time  change,  and must timely require that any taximeter in a
  taxicab or HAIL vehicle used to provide trips that originate in the city
  be adjusted to include the pass-through.
    (2) A taxicab owner or a HAIL base or HAIL vehicle owner in such  city
  must  timely  adjust  the  taximeter in any of such person's taxicabs or


 HAIL vehicles so that it reflects such pass-through as such pass-through
  amount may from time to time change.
    (3)  Neither  the  failure of such city or the TLC to adjust fares nor
  the failure of a taxicab owner, HAIL base, HAIL vehicle owner, or  other
  person  to adjust a taximeter will relieve any person liable for the tax
  imposed by this article from the obligation to pay such tax  timely,  at
  the correct rate.
    (d)  Nothing  in  this  article  shall  be  construed  as limiting the
  imposition of any tax imposed by article twenty-eight of this chapter on
  transportation service provided by a HAIL base, HAIL vehicle,  or  owner
  or   operator   of  a  HAIL  vehicle.  Nor  shall  anything  in  article
  twenty-eight of this chapter be construed as limiting the imposition  of
  any  tax  imposed  by this article on a HAIL vehicle trip or as limiting
  the obligation on a HAIL base to pay such tax.




   §  1284.  Returns.  Every  person  liable  for the tax imposed by this
  article shall file a return quarterly with the commissioner. Each return
  shall show the number of trips in the quarter for which  the  return  is
  filed,  together  with  such  other  information as the commissioner may
  require.   The returns required by  this  section  shall  be  filed  for
  quarterly  periods ending on the last day of March, June, September, and
  December of each year, and each return shall be filed within twenty days
  after the end of the quarterly period covered thereby. Every such person
  shall also file a  return  with  the  commissioner  for  the  period  of
  November  and  December  two  thousand  nine,  by January twentieth, two
  thousand  ten,  containing  the  information  described  above.  If  the
  commissioner  deems  it  necessary in order to ensure the payment of the
  tax imposed by this article, the commissioner may require returns to  be
  made  for shorter periods than prescribed by the foregoing provisions of
  this section, and upon such dates as the commissioner may  specify.  The
  form  of  returns  shall  be  prescribed  by  the commissioner and shall
  contain such information as the commissioner may deem necessary for  the
  proper  administration  of  this  article.  The commissioner may require
  amended returns to be filed within  twenty  days  after  notice  and  to
  contain  the  information  specified in the notice. The commissioner may
  require that the returns be filed electronically.




   §  1285.  Payment of tax. Every person required to file a return under
  this article shall, at the time  of  filing  such  return,  pay  to  the
  commissioner  the  total  of  all  tax  imposed  by this article, on the
  correct number of trips subject to tax under this article. The amount so
  payable to the commissioner  for  the  period  for  which  a  return  is
  required to be filed shall be due and payable to the commissioner on the
  date  limited  for  the  filing  of  the return for such period, without
  regard to whether a return is filed or whether the return which is filed
  correctly shows the correct number of trips or the  amount  of  tax  due
  thereon.   The   commissioner   may   require   that  the  tax  be  paid
  electronically.




   §  1286.  Records  to  be  kept.  (a)  Every person liable for any tax
  imposed by this article shall keep:
    (1) records of every taxicab or HAIL vehicle trip originating  in  the
  city  and  of  all  amounts  paid, charged or due thereon and of the tax
  payable thereon, in such form as the commissioner may require;
    (2) a  true  and  complete  copy  of  every  contract,  agreement,  or
  arrangement  concerning  the  lease, rental, or license to use a taxicab
  for which the person is required to remit the tax on  trips  imposed  by
  this article on such person;
    (3)  a  true  and  complete  copy  of  every  contract,  agreement, or
  arrangement concerning the appointment of an agent;
    (4) a  true  and  complete  copy  of  every  contract,  agreement,  or
  arrangement  concerning  the  affiliation of a HAIL vehicle or of a HAIL
  vehicle owner or driver with a HAIL base;
    (5) true and complete copies of any records required to be kept by the
  TLC; and
    (6) such other records and information as the commissioner may require
  to perform his or her duties under this article.
    (b) Every person that has contracted with the city or TLC  to  provide
  services  to  the  city,  to the TLC, or to persons liable for tax under
  this article relating to taximeters, to administering taximeters  or  to
  information  obtained  from taximeters and every person that the TLC has
  authorized to obtain or  possess  information  generated  by  taximeters
  shall keep true and complete copies of all meter information.
    (c) The records required to be kept by this section shall be available
  for   inspection  and  examination  at  any  time  upon  demand  by  the
  commissioner or the commissioner's duly authorized agent or employee and
  shall be preserved  for  a  period  of  three  years,  except  that  the
  commissioner  may consent to their destruction within that period or may
  require that they be kept longer. Such records may be  kept  within  the
  meaning   of   this   section   when  reproduced  on  any  photographic,
  photostatic, microfilm,  micro-card,  miniature  photographic  or  other
  process  which actually reproduces the original record. If those records
  are maintained in an electronic format, they must be made available  and
  accessible to the commissioner in electronic format.




   §  1287. Secrecy of returns and reports. (a) Except in accordance with
  proper judicial order or as otherwise  provided  by  law,  it  shall  be
  unlawful   for   the  commissioner,  any  officer  or  employee  of  the
  department, any person engaged or  retained  by  the  department  on  an
  independent  contract basis, or any person who in any manner may acquire
  knowledge of  the  contents  of  a  return  or  report  filed  with  the
  commissioner  pursuant  to this article, to divulge or make known in any
  manner any particulars set forth or disclosed  in  any  such  return  or
  report.  The  officers  charged  with  the  custody  of such returns and
  reports shall not be required to produce any  of  them  or  evidence  of
  anything  contained  in  them  in any action or proceeding in any court,
  except on behalf of the commissioner in an action  or  proceeding  under
  the  provisions  of  this  chapter  or in any other action or proceeding
  involving the collection of a tax due under this chapter  to  which  the
  state  or the commissioner is a party or a claimant, or on behalf of any
  party to any action, proceeding or hearing under the provisions of  this
  article  when  the  returns, reports or facts shown thereby are directly
  involved in such action, proceeding or hearing, in any of  which  events
  the  court, or in the case of a hearing, the division of tax appeals may
  require the production of, and may admit into evidence, so much of  said
  returns,  reports or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the
  action, proceeding or hearing and  no  more.  The  commissioner  or  the
  division  of  tax appeals may, nevertheless, publish a copy or a summary
  of any decision rendered after  a  hearing  required  by  this  article.
  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a
  person  who  has  filed  a  return  or  report  or to such person's duly
  authorized representative of a certified copy of any  return  or  report
  filed  in  connection with such person's tax. Nor shall anything in this
  section be construed  to  prohibit  the  publication  of  statistics  so
  classified  as  to  prevent  the identification of particular returns or
  reports and the items thereof, or the inspection by the attorney general
  or other legal representatives of the state of the return or  report  of
  any  person required to pay the tax who shall bring action to review the
  tax based thereon, or against whom an action or  proceeding  under  this
  chapter has been recommended by the commissioner or the attorney general
  or  has  been  instituted,  or  the inspection of the returns or reports
  required under this  article  by  the  comptroller  or  duly  designated
  officer  or  employee  of the state department of audit and control, for
  purposes of the audit of a refund of any tax paid by a  person  required
  to  pay  the  tax under this article. Provided, further, nothing in this
  section shall be construed to prohibit the disclosure, in such manner as
  the commissioner deems appropriate, of the names and  other  appropriate
  identifying  information of those persons required to pay tax under this
  article.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section,
  the commissioner may, in  his  or  her  discretion,  permit  the  proper
  officer  of  the  city  or  the  duly  authorized representative of such
  officer, to inspect any return filed under this article, or may  furnish
  to  such officer or such officer's authorized representative an abstract
  of any such return or supply such person with information concerning  an
  item  contained in any such return, or disclosed by any investigation of
  tax liability under this article; but such permission shall  be  granted
  or  such  information  furnished  only if the city or the TLC shall have
  furnished  the  commissioner  with  all  information  requested  by  the
  commissioner  pursuant  to  this  article  and  shall have permitted the
  commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative to make any
  inspection of  any  records  or  reports  concerning  taxicabs,  taxicab
  owners, agents, HAIL vehicles, HAIL vehicle owners, and HAIL bases filed


 with  or  possessed  by  such city or the TLC which the commissioner may
  have requested from such city or the TLC. Provided,  further,  that  the
  commissioner may disclose to the city or the TLC whether or not a person
  liable  for  the tax imposed by this article has paid all of the tax due
  under this article as of any given date.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section,
  the commissioner, in his or her discretion, may require or permit any or
  all persons liable for any tax imposed by this article, to make  payment
  to   banks,   banking  houses  or  trust  companies  designated  by  the
  commissioner and to file returns with  such  banks,  banking  houses  or
  trust  companies  as  agents  of the commissioner, in lieu of paying any
  such tax directly to the commissioner. However, the  commissioner  shall
  designate  only  such  banks,  banking  houses or trust companies as are
  already designated  by  the  comptroller  as  depositories  pursuant  to
  section twelve hundred eighty-eight of this article.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section,
  the  commissioner may permit the secretary of the treasury of the United

   §  1288.  Deposit  and  disposition  of  revenue.  Notwithstanding any
  provision of law to the contrary: (a) All taxes, interest and  penalties
  collected or received by the commissioner pursuant to this article shall
  be  deposited daily with such responsible banks, banking houses or trust
  companies, as may be designated by the comptroller,  in  trust  for  the
  credit  of  the metropolitan transportation authority. An account may be
  established in one or more of such depositories. Such deposits shall  be
  kept  separate  and  apart from all other money in the possession of the

  such depositories. Of the total revenue collected or received under this
  section,  the  comptroller  shall retain in the comptroller's hands such
  amount as the commissioner may determine to  be  necessary  for  refunds
  under  this  article.  The  commissioner  is  authorized and directed to
  deduct from such amounts  collected  or  received  under  this  article,
  before  deposit  into  the  accounts  specified  by  the  comptroller, a
  reasonable amount necessary to effectuate refunds of  appropriations  of
  the  department to reimburse the department for the costs to administer,
  collect and distribute the taxes imposed by this article.
    (b) On or before the twelfth day following  the  end  of  each  month,
  after  reserving  such  amount  for  such  refunds  and  such costs, the
  commissioner shall certify to the comptroller the amount of all revenues
  so received pursuant to this article during the prior month as a  result
  of the taxes, interest and penalties so imposed.
    (c)  By  the  fifteenth day of the last month of each calendar quarter
  the comptroller shall pay over the amount of  revenues  from  the  prior
  three  months  in  total  so  certified  by  the  commissioner,  without
  appropriation,  into  the  corporate  transportation  account   of   the
  metropolitan    transportation   authority   special   assistance   fund
  established  by  section  twelve  hundred  seventy-a   of   the   public
  authorities   law  to  be  applied  as  provided  in  paragraph  (e)  of
  subdivision four of such section twelve  hundred  seventy-a.  Any  money
  collected  pursuant to this article that is deposited by the comptroller
  in  the   corporate   transportation   account   of   the   metropolitan
  transportation  authority  special assistance fund shall be held in such
  fund free and clear of any claim by any person or entity paying the  tax
  pursuant  to this article, including, without limiting the generality of
  the  foregoing,  any   right   or   claim   against   the   metropolitan
  transportation  authority,  any of its bondholders, or any subsidiary or
  affiliate of the metropolitan transportation authority.




   § 1289. Cooperation by city. The city and the TLC shall cooperate with
  and  assist  the commissioner to effect the purposes of this article and
  the commissioner's responsibilities under this article. Such cooperation
  shall include the city or TLC obtaining, furnishing, and timely updating
  current,  complete  and  accurate  names,  addresses   and   all   other
  information  concerning every (1) taxicab owner, operator, and driver of
  taxicabs in the city, (2) agent and vehicle owner, and  (3)  HAIL  base,
  HAIL  vehicle owner, HAIL vehicle, and driver of a HAIL vehicle, and the
  trip records and other records of any of them, in the city's  possession
  or  in the possession of any of its agencies, instrumentalities, agents,
  contractors, or any other person the TLC has authorized or  required  to
  obtain  or  possess such records or information, together with any other
  information the commissioner requests, all in a  format  prescribed  by,
  and  without  cost  to, the commissioner. The TLC shall also furnish, or
  cause to be furnished, in a format prescribed by the  commissioner,  any
  records  or  information  in  the  possession  of  the TLC, any agent or
  contractor of the city or the TLC, or  any  other  person  the  TLC  has
  authorized or required to obtain or possess such records or information,
  concerning  the  persons  liable  for  the  tax imposed by this article,
  including, among other things, detailed trip  record  information.  Such
  cooperation shall also include the TLC assigning identifying numbers and
  other  identifying  indicia  to  HAIL  bases,  HAIL vehicle owners, HAIL
  vehicles, and drivers of HAIL vehicles in a  format  prescribed  by  the
  commissioner,  so  as  to  facilitate  filing  returns,  paying tax, and
  performing other tasks required to administer the tax  imposed  by  this
  article.




   § 1290. Practice and procedure. The provisions of article twenty-seven
  of  this  chapter  shall apply with respect to the administration of and
  procedure with respect to the tax imposed by this article  in  the  same
  manner  and  with  the  same force and effect as if the language of such
  article twenty-seven had been incorporated in full into this article and
  had expressly referred to the tax under  this  article,  except  to  the
  extent  that  any such provision is either inconsistent with a provision
  of this article or is not relevant to this article.




   §  1291.  Definitions.  (a) "Person" means an individual, partnership,
  limited liability company, society, association,  joint  stock  company,
  corporation,  estate,  receiver, trustee, assignee, referee or any other
  person  acting  in  a  fiduciary  or  representative  capacity,  whether
  appointed  by  a  court or otherwise, any combination of individuals and
  any other form of unincorporated enterprise owned or conducted by two or
  more persons.
    (b) "City"  means  a  city  of  a  million  or  more  located  in  the
  metropolitan  commuter  transportation  district  established by section

  meaning  as  the  term is defined in article forty-four-B of the vehicle
  and traffic law.
    (d) "TNC prearranged trip" shall have the same meaning as the term  is
  defined in article forty-four-B of the vehicle and traffic law.

  article forty-four-B of the vehicle and traffic law.

  charge  and  time  charge  for  a  complete  TNC prearranged trip at the
  applicable rate charged by the TNC at the time such trip is arranged.




   §  1292.  Imposition.  There  is  hereby  imposed on every TNC a state
  assessment fee of 4% of the gross trip fare  of  every  TNC  prearranged
  trip  provided by such TNC that originates anywhere in the state outside
  the city and terminates anywhere in this state.




   §  1293.  Presumption. For the purpose of the proper administration of
  this article and to prevent evasion of the state assessment fee  imposed
  by  this  article,  it shall be presumed that every TNC prearranged trip
  that originates anywhere in the state outside the city is subject to the
  state assessment fee. This presumption shall prevail until the  contrary
  is proven by the person liable for the fee.




   §  1294. Returns and payment of state assessment fee. (a) Every person
  liable for the state assessment fee imposed by this article shall file a
  return on a calendar-quarterly basis with the commissioner. Each  return
  shall  show  the  number  of TNC prearranged trips, the total gross trip
  fares and the amount of fees due thereon in the quarter  for  which  the
  return   is   filed,   together  with  such  other  information  as  the
  commissioner may require. The returns required by this section shall  be
  filed  within  thirty days after the end of the quarterly period covered
  thereby. If the commissioner deems it necessary in order to  ensure  the
  payment  of  the  state  assessment  fee  imposed  by  this article, the
  commissioner may require returns to be made  for  shorter  periods  than
  prescribed  by  the  foregoing provisions of this section, and upon such
  dates as the commissioner may specify. The  form  of  returns  shall  be
  prescribed by the commissioner and shall contain such information as the
  commissioner  may  deem  necessary for the proper administration of this
  article. The commissioner may require amended returns to be filed within
  thirty days after notice and to contain the information specified in the
  notice.  The  commissioner  may  require  that  the  returns  be   filed
  electronically.
    (b)  Every  person required to file a return under this article shall,
  at the time of filing such return, pay to the commissioner the total  of
  all state assessment fees on the correct number of trips subject to such
  fee  under  this  article. The amount so payable to the commissioner for
  the period for which a return is required to be filed shall be  due  and
  payable  to the commissioner on the date specified for the filing of the
  return for such period, without regard to whether a return is  filed  or
  whether  the  return that is filed correctly shows the correct number of
  trips, gross trip fares or amount of fees due thereon. The  commissioner
  may require that the fee be paid electronically.






	   §  1295.  Records  to  be  kept.  Every  person  liable  for the state
  assessment fee imposed by this article shall keep:
    (a) records of  every  TNC  prearranged  trip  subject  to  the  state
  assessment  fee  under this article, and of all amounts paid, charged or
  due thereon, in such form as the commissioner may require;
    (b) true and complete copies,  including  electronic  copies,  of  any
  records  required  to  be  kept  by a state agency that is authorized to
  permit or regulate a TNC; and
    (c) such other records and information as the commissioner may require
  to perform his or her duties under this article.




   §  1296. Secrecy of returns and reports. (a) Except in accordance with
  proper judicial order or as otherwise  provided  by  law,  it  shall  be
  unlawful   for   the  commissioner,  any  officer  or  employee  of  the
  department, any person engaged or  retained  by  the  department  on  an
  independent  contract basis, or any person who in any manner may acquire
  knowledge of  the  contents  of  a  return  or  report  filed  with  the
  commissioner  pursuant  to this article, to divulge or make known in any
  manner any particulars set forth or disclosed  in  any  such  return  or
  report.  The  officers  charged  with  the  custody  of such returns and
  reports shall not be required to produce any  of  them  or  evidence  of
  anything  contained  in  them  in any action or proceeding in any court,
  except on behalf of the commissioner in an action  or  proceeding  under
  the  provisions  of  this  chapter  or in any other action or proceeding
  involving the collection of  a  state  assessment  fee  due  under  this
  article to which the state or the commissioner is a party or a claimant,
  or on behalf of any party to any action, proceeding or hearing under the
  provisions  of  this  article  when  the returns, reports or facts shown
  thereby are directly involved in such action, proceeding or hearing,  in
  any of which events the court, or in the case of a hearing, the division
  of  tax  appeals  may  require  the  production  of,  and may admit into
  evidence, so much of  said  returns,  reports  or  of  the  facts  shown
  thereby,  as  are  pertinent to the action, proceeding or hearing and no
  more. The commissioner or the division of tax appeals may, nevertheless,
  publish a copy or a summary of any decision  rendered  after  a  hearing
  required  by this article. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
  prohibit the delivery to a person who has filed a return or report or to
  such person's duly authorized representative of a certified copy of  any
  return or report filed in connection with such person's state assessment
  fee.  Nor  shall  anything  in this section be construed to prohibit the
  publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification
  of  particular  returns  or  reports  and  the  items  thereof,  or  the
  inspection by the attorney general or other legal representatives of the
  state  of  the  return or report of any person required to pay the state
  assessment fee who shall bring action to review the state assessment fee
  based thereon, or against  whom  an  action  or  proceeding  under  this
  chapter has been recommended by the commissioner or the attorney general
  or  has  been  instituted,  or  the inspection of the returns or reports
  required under this  article  by  the  comptroller  or  duly  designated
  officer  or  employee  of the state department of audit and control, for
  purposes of the audit of a refund of any state assessment fee paid by  a
  person  required  to  pay  the  state assessment fee under this article.
  Provided, further,  nothing  in  this  section  shall  be  construed  to
  prohibit  the  disclosure,  in  such  manner  as  the commissioner deems
  appropriate, of the names and other appropriate identifying  information
  of  those  persons  required  to  pay  state  assessment  fee under this
  article.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section,
  the commissioner, in his or her discretion, may require or permit any or
  all persons liable for any state assessment fee imposed by this article,
  to make payment to banks, banking houses or trust  companies  designated
  by  the commissioner and to file returns with such banks, banking houses
  or trust companies as agents of the commissioner, in lieu of paying  any
  such  state  assessment  fee  directly to the commissioner. However, the
  commissioner shall designate only such banks, banking  houses  or  trust
  companies  as  are already designated by the comptroller as depositories
  pursuant to section twelve hundred eighty-eight of this chapter.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section,
  the commissioner may permit the secretary of the treasury of the  United


 States or such secretary's delegate, or the authorized representative of
  either  such officer, to inspect any return filed under this article, or
  may furnish to such officer or such officer's authorized  representative
  an  abstract  of  any such return or supply such person with information
  concerning an item contained in any such return,  or  disclosed  by  any
  investigation of liability under this article, but such permission shall
  be  granted or such information furnished only if the laws of the United
  States grant substantially similar privileges  to  the  commissioner  or
  officer  of  this  state  charged  with  the administration of the state
  assessment fee imposed by this article, and only if such information  is
  to be used for purposes of tax administration only; and provided further
  the  commissioner may furnish to the commissioner of internal revenue or
  such commissioner's authorized representative such returns  filed  under
  this  article  and  other  tax  information,  as  such  commissioner may
  consider proper, for use in  court  actions  or  proceedings  under  the
  internal  revenue  code,  whether  civil  or  criminal,  where a written
  request therefor has been made to the commissioner by the  secretary  of
  the treasury of the United States or such secretary's delegate, provided
  the  laws of the United States grant substantially similar powers to the
  secretary of the treasury of the United States or his or  her  delegate.
  Where  the  commissioner  has  so  authorized  use  of returns and other
  information in such actions or proceedings, officers  and  employees  of
  the  department may testify in such actions or proceedings in respect to
  such returns or other information.
    (d) Returns and reports filed under this article  shall  be  preserved
  for  three years and thereafter until the commissioner orders them to be
  destroyed.
    (e) (1) Any officer or employee of the state  who  willfully  violates
  the  provisions  of  subdivision  (a) of this section shall be dismissed
  from office and be incapable of holding any public office for  a  period
  of five years thereafter.
    (2)  Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see article thirty-seven
  of this chapter.

  section,  upon  written request from the chairperson of the committee on

  chairperson  of the committee on finance of the United States Senate, or

  Congress representing New York state, or any person who served in or was
  employed by the executive branch of the government of the United  States

  however that, prior to furnishing any return or report, the commissioner
  shall  redact any copy of a federal return (or portion thereof) attached
  to, or any information on a federal return that is  reflected  on,  such
  return  or  report, and any social security numbers, account numbers and
  residential address information.
    (2) No  returns  or  reports  shall  be  furnished  pursuant  to  this
  subdivision unless the chairperson of the requesting committee certifies

  transportation  trips,  including  the  owners,  agents  and  drivers of
  for-hire vehicles.




   §  1299-A.  Imposition  of  tax.  (a)  In addition to any other tax or
  assessment imposed by  this  chapter  or  other  law,  there  is  hereby
  imposed,  beginning on January first, two thousand nineteen, a surcharge
  on for-hire transportation trips of two dollars and  seventy-five  cents
  for  each  such  trip  that  originates and terminates in the congestion
  zone, for each such trip that  originates  anywhere  in  the  state  and
  terminates   within  the  congestion  zone,  for  each  such  trip  that
  originates in the congestion zone and terminates anywhere in this state,
  and for each such trip that originates anywhere  in  the  state,  enters
  into  the  congestion  zone while in transit, and terminates anywhere in
  the state. For purposes of this subsection,  a  for-hire  transportation
  trip  shall  be  deemed  to  originate  in  the congestion zone when any
  requesting passenger is picked up there (or if the billing for the ride,
  or any portion thereof, is commenced there), and is deemed to  terminate
  in  the  congestion  zone  when  any requesting passenger is dropped off
  there. Provided however, if the for-hire transportation trip is provided
  by a for-hire vehicle that is also subject to article  twenty-nine-A  of
  this  chapter,  excluding a HAIL vehicle as defined by such article, the
  rate of surcharge under this subsection shall be two dollars  and  fifty
  cents for each trip.
    (b) In addition to any other tax or assessment imposed by this chapter
  or  other  law, beginning on January first, two thousand nineteen, there
  is  hereby  imposed  on  transportation  provided  by  pool  vehicles  a
  surcharge  of  seventy-five  cents  for each person that both enters and
  exits the pool vehicle in the state, and who is picked  up  in,  dropped
  off in, or travels through the congestion zone.
    (c)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  surcharge  imposed by this
  article shall not apply to transportation services that are administered
  by or on behalf of the metropolitan transportation authority,  including
  paratransit services.
    (d)  Receipts subject to tax under paragraph ten of subdivision (c) of
  section eleven hundred five of this chapter, as well as the  gross  trip
  fare of every TNC prearranged trip as those terms are defined by section
  twelve  hundred  ninety-one  of this chapter, shall be deemed to exclude
  any surcharge imposed by this article.




   §  1299-B.  Liability for surcharge. (a) Notwithstanding any provision
  of law to the contrary, any person that dispatches a  motor  vehicle  by
  any  means  that  provides transportation that is subject to a surcharge
  imposed by this article, including transportation network  companies  as
  defined in article forty-four-B of the vehicle and traffic law, shall be
  liable  for  the  surcharge  imposed by this article, except that in the
  case of taxicab trips and HAIL vehicle trips that are  also  subject  to
  tax  pursuant  to  article twenty-nine-A of this chapter: (1) a TSP that
  collected the trip record  and  trip  fare  shall  withhold  from  daily
  collections  the  surcharges  due on such trips, and shall withhold from
  such collections the surcharges due on cash trips. If  the  TSP's  daily
  collections,  after  retaining any fees to which it is entitled pursuant
  to a contract with  such  taxicab  owner  or  HAIL  vehicle  owner,  are
  insufficient  to  cover  the  surcharges due on such cash trips, the TSP
  shall withhold an amount  from  subsequent  daily  collections,  to  the
  extent  funds  are  available,  until  all  surcharges due for a monthly
  period have been withheld. If a  TSP  is  unable  to  withhold  all  the
  surcharges  due  in  a monthly period, it shall withhold such unwithheld
  surcharges from daily collections in the  next  monthly  period.  A  TSP
  shall  be  jointly  liable for the surcharge imposed by this article for
  all trips for which the TSP collected the  trip  record,  but  shall  be
  relieved  of liability for any surcharges attributable to cash trips for
  which it was unable  to  withhold  the  surcharges  because  there  were
  insufficient daily collections during twelve successive monthly periods.
  (2)  The  TSP  shall be responsible for filing monthly returns reporting
  the surcharges due on all trips for which  it  collected  trip  records,
  shall  remit  the surcharges withheld on all such trips and shall report
  any unwithheld surcharges due because of insufficient daily  collections
  to  cover  the  tax due on cash trips. For purposes of this section, the
  terms "taxicab trips," "HAIL  vehicle  trips,"  "taxicab  owner,"  "HAIL
  base,"  "TSP"  and "cash trip" shall have the same meaning as they do in
  section twelve hundred eighty of this chapter.
    (b) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary: (1) The surcharge imposed
  by this article must be passed along to passengers and separately stated
  on any receipt that is provided to such passengers. The passing along of
  such surcharge shall not be construed by  any  court  or  administrative
  body  as  the  imposition  of the surcharge on the person or entity that
  pays for the for-hire transportation trip. All regulatory agencies  must
  adjust  any  fares  that are authorized by them to include the surcharge
  imposed by this article, and  must  require  that  any  meter  or  other
  instrument  used  in  any  for-hire vehicle regulated by it to calculate
  fares be adjusted to include the surcharge.
    (2) Neither the failure of a regulatory agency to adjust fares nor the
  failure to adjust a meter or other instrument used in a for-hire vehicle
  to calculate fares shall relieve any person  liable  for  the  surcharge
  imposed by this article from the obligation to pay such surcharge.
   §  1299-D.  Returns  and payment of surcharge. (a) Every person liable
  for the surcharge imposed by this article shall file a return  with  the
  commissioner  on  a  monthly basis. Each return shall show the number of
  for-hire transportation trips, or the number of pool vehicle passengers,
  subject to the surcharge imposed by this article in the month for  which
  the   return  is  filed,  along  with  such  other  information  as  the
  commissioner may require. The returns required by this section shall  be
  filed  within twenty days after the end of the month covered thereby. If
  the commissioner deems  it  necessary  to  ensure  the  payment  of  the
  surcharge  imposed  by this article, he or she may require returns to be
  made for shorter periods than prescribed by the foregoing provisions  of
  this  section,  and  upon  such  dates  as may be specified. The form of
  returns shall be prescribed by the commissioner and shall  contain  such
  information  as  the  commissioner  may  deem  necessary  for the proper
  administration of  this  article.  The  commissioner  may  require  that
  returns be filed electronically.
    (b)  Every  person  liable  for  the surcharge imposed by this article
  shall, at the time of filing such return, pay to  the  commissioner  the
  total amount of all surcharges due under this article. Such amount shall
  be  due  and  payable on the date specified for the filing of the return
  for such period, without regard to whether a return is filed, or whether
  the return that is filed correctly shows the correct number of  for-hire
  trips  are  subject  the  surcharge, or the correct surcharge amount due
  thereon. The  commissioner  may  require  that  the  surcharge  be  paid
  electronically.
    (c)  In  addition  to any other penalty or interest provided for under
  this article or other law, and unless it is shown that such  failure  is
  due  to  reasonable  cause  and  not  due to willful neglect, any person
  liable for the surcharge imposed by this article that fails to pay  such
  surcharge  when  due shall be liable for a penalty in an amount equal to
  two hundred percent of the total surcharge amount that is due.




   §  1299-E.  Records  to be kept. Every person liable for the surcharge
  imposed by this article shall keep, and shall make available for  review
  upon demand by the commissioner:
    (1)  records  of  every  trip  provided or arranged by such person, or
  provided through the use of a for-hire vehicle owned or leased  by  such
  person, including all amounts paid, charged or due thereon, in such form
  as the commissioner may require;
    (2) true and complete copies of any records required to be kept by any
  applicable regulatory department or agency; and
    (3) such other records and information as the commissioner may require
  to perform his or her duties under this article.




   §  1299-F.  Secrecy  of  returns and reports. (a) Except in accordance
  with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall  be
  unlawful   for   the  commissioner,  any  officer  or  employee  of  the
  department, any person engaged or  retained  by  the  department  on  an
  independent  contract basis, or any person who in any manner may acquire
  knowledge of  the  contents  of  a  return  or  report  filed  with  the
  commissioner  pursuant  to this article, to divulge or make known in any
  manner any particulars set forth or disclosed  in  any  such  return  or
  report.  The  officers  charged  with  the  custody  of such returns and
  reports shall not be required to produce any  of  them  or  evidence  of
  anything  contained  in  them  in any action or proceeding in any court,
  except on behalf of the commissioner in an action  or  proceeding  under
  the  provisions  of  this  chapter, or in any other action or proceeding
  involving the collection of a tax due under this chapter  to  which  the
  state,  the  commissioner  or  an agency that is authorized to permit or
  regulate the provision of any relevant transportation is a  party  or  a
  claimant, or on behalf of any party to any action, proceeding or hearing
  under the provisions of this article, when the returns or the reports or
  the facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action, proceeding
  or  hearing,  in  any  of  which  events  the court, or in the case of a
  hearing, the division of tax appeals, may require the production of, and
  may admit in evidence so much of said returns or reports or of the facts
  shown thereby as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no  more.
  Nothing   herein   shall   be   construed,   however,  to  prohibit  the
  commissioner, in his or her discretion, from allowing the inspection  or
  delivery  of  a  certified copy of any return or report filed under this
  article, or from providing any information contained in any such  return
  or  report,  by  or  to  a  duly  authorized  officer or employee of the
  comptroller; nor to prohibit the inspection or delivery of  a  certified
  copy  of any return or report filed under this article, or the provision
  of any information contained therein, by or to the attorney  general  or
  other  legal representatives of the state when an action shall have been
  recommended or commenced pursuant to this chapter in which such  returns
  or  reports  or  the  facts  shown thereby are directly involved; nor to
  prohibit the commissioner from providing or certifying to  the  division
  of  budget  or  the  comptroller  the total number of returns or reports
  filed  under  this  article  in  any  reporting  period  and  the  total
  collections received therefrom; nor to prohibit the delivery to a person
  liable  for  the surcharge imposed by this article, or a duly authorized
  representative of such, a certified copy of any return or  report  filed
  by such person pursuant to this article, nor to prohibit the publication
  of  statistics  so  classified  as  to  prevent  the  identification  of
  particular returns or reports and the items thereof; nor to prohibit the
  disclosure, in such manner as the commissioner deems appropriate, of the
  names and other appropriate identifying  information  of  those  persons
  required to pay the surcharge imposed by this article.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section,
  the  commissioner may permit the secretary of the treasury of the United
  States or such secretary's delegate, or the authorized representative of
  either such officer, to inspect any return filed under this article,  or
  may  furnish to such officer or such officer's authorized representative
  an abstract of any such return or supply such  person  with  information
  concerning  an  item  contained  in any such return, or disclosed by any
  investigation of liability under this article, but such permission shall
  be granted or such information furnished only if the laws of the  United
  States  grant  substantially  similar  privileges to the commissioner or
  officer of this state charged with the administration of  the  surcharge
  imposed  by this article, and only if such information is to be used for


 purposes  of  tax  administration  only;  and   provided   further   the
  commissioner may furnish to the commissioner of internal revenue or such
  commissioner's  authorized  representative such returns filed under this
  article  and  other  tax  information, as such commissioner may consider
  proper, for use in court  actions  or  proceedings  under  the  internal
  revenue  code,  whether  civil  or  criminal,  where  a  written request
  therefor has been made to the  commissioner  by  the  secretary  of  the
  treasury of the United States or such secretary's delegate, provided the
  laws  of  the  United  States  grant substantially similar powers to the
  secretary of the treasury of the United States or his or  her  delegate.
  Where  the  commissioner  has  so  authorized  use  of returns and other
  information in such actions or proceedings, officers  and  employees  of
  the  department may testify in such actions or proceedings in respect to
  such returns or other information.
    (c) (1) Any officer or employee of the state  who  willfully  violates
  the  provisions  of  subdivision  (a) of this section shall be dismissed
  from office and be incapable of holding any public office for  a  period
  of five years thereafter.
    (2)  Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see article thirty-seven
  of this chapter.
    (d) (1) Notwithstanding the provisions  of  subdivision  (a)  of  this
  section,  upon  written request from the chairperson of the committee on
  ways and means of  the  United  States  House  of  Representatives,  the
  chairperson  of the committee on finance of the United States Senate, or
  the chairperson of the joint committee on taxation of the United  States
  Congress, the commissioner shall furnish such committee with any current
  or  prior  year  returns specified in such request that were filed under
  this article by the president of the United  States,  vice-president  of
  the United States, member of the United States Congress representing New
  York state, or any person who served in or was employed by the executive
  branch  of the government of the United States on the executive staff of
  the president, in the executive office of the president, or in an acting
  or confirmed capacity in a  position  subject  to  confirmation  by  the
  United  States  senate;  or,  in  New  York  state:  a statewide elected
  official, as defined in paragraph (a)  of  subdivision  one  of  section
  seventy-three-a of the public officers law; a state officer or employee,
  as  defined  in  subparagraph (i) of paragraph (c) of subdivision one of
  such section seventy-three-a; a political party chairperson, as  defined
  in  paragraph  (h) of subdivision one of such section seventy-three-a; a
  local elected official, as  defined  in  subdivisions  one  and  two  of
  section  eight  hundred  ten  of  the  general  municipal  law; a person
  appointed, pursuant to law, to serve due to vacancy or otherwise in  the
  position of a local elected official, as defined in subdivisions one and
  two  of section eight hundred ten of the general municipal law; a member
  of the state legislature; or a judge or justice  of  the  unified  court
  system;  or  filed  by  a  partnership,  firm, association, corporation,
  joint-stock company, trust or  similar  entity  directly  or  indirectly
  controlled  by  any  individual  listed  in  this  paragraph, whether by
  contract, through ownership or control of a majority  interest  in  such
  entity,  or  otherwise,  or  filed  by a partnership, firm, association,
  corporation, joint-stock company, trust or similar entity of  which  any
  individual  listed  in  this  paragraph holds ten percent or more of the
  voting securities of  such  entity;  provided  however  that,  prior  to
  furnishing  any  return,  the  commissioner  shall  redact any copy of a
  federal return (or portion thereof) attached to, or any information on a
  federal return that  is  reflected  on,  such  return,  and  any  social
  security numbers, account numbers and residential address information.


   (2)  No returns shall be furnished pursuant to this subdivision unless
  the chairperson of the requesting committee certifies  in  writing  that
  such  returns  have  been requested related to, and in furtherance of, a
  legitimate task of the Congress, that the requesting committee has  made
  a  written  request  to  the United States secretary of the treasury for
  related federal returns or reports  or  return  or  report  information,
  pursuant  to  26  U.S.C.  Section  6103(f),  and  that if such requested
  returns are inspected by and/or submitted to another committee,  to  the
  United  States House of Representatives, or to the United States Senate,
  then  such  inspection  and/or  submission  shall  occur  in  a   manner
  consistent  with  federal  law  as  informed  by  the  requirements  and
  procedures established in 26 U.S.C. Section 6103(f).
    (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section,
  the commissioner may, in  his  or  her  discretion,  permit  the  proper
  officer  of  the  taxi  and limousine commission of the city of New York
  (TLC) or the duly authorized representative of such officer, to  inspect
  any  return  filed under this article, or may furnish to such officer or
  such officer's authorized representative an abstract of any such  return
  or  supply  such person with information concerning an item contained in
  any such return, or disclosed by  any  investigation  of  tax  liability
  under  this  article;  but  such  permission  shall  be  granted or such
  information  furnished  only  if  the  TLC  shall  have  furnished   the
  commissioner with all information requested by the commissioner pursuant
  to  this  article  and  shall  have  permitted  the  commissioner or the
  commissioner's authorized representative to make any inspection  of  any
  records  or  reports concerning for-hire transportation trips subject to
  the surcharge imposed by this  article,  and  any  persons  required  to
  collect  such  surcharge,  filed  with  or possessed by the TLC that the
  commissioner may have requested from the TLC.  Provided,  further,  that
  the  commissioner may disclose to the TLC whether or not a person liable
  for the surcharge imposed by this article has paid all of the surcharges
  due under this article as of any given date.




   §   1299-G.   Practice   and  procedure.  The  provisions  of  article
  twenty-seven  of  this  chapter  shall  apply  with   respect   to   the
  administration of and procedure with respect to the surcharge imposed by
  this article in the same manner and with the same force and effect as if
  the  language of such article twenty-seven had been incorporated in full
  into this article and had expressly referred to the surcharge imposed by
  this article, except to the extent that any  such  provision  is  either
  inconsistent with a provision of this article or is not relevant to this
  article.




   §  1299-H.  Deposit  and  disposition  of  revenue. (a) Any surcharge,
  interest, and penalties collected or received by the commissioner  shall
  be  deposited daily with such responsible banks, banking houses or trust
  companies, as may be designated by the comptroller, to the credit of the
  comptroller in trust for the metropolitan transportation  authority.  An
  account  may  be  established  in one or more of such depositories. Such
  deposits will be kept separate and apart from all  other  money  in  the
  possession  of  the  comptroller. The comptroller shall require adequate
  security from all such depositories. Of the total revenue  collected  or
  received under this article, the comptroller shall retain such amount as
  the  commissioner  may  determine to be necessary for refunds under this
  article. The commissioner is authorized and directed to deduct from  the
  amounts  it  receives  under this article, before deposit into the trust
  accounts designated by the comptroller, a reasonable amount necessary to
  effectuate refunds of appropriations of the department to reimburse  the
  department  for the costs incurred to administer, collect and distribute
  the surcharge, interest, and penalties imposed by this article.
    (b) On or before the twelfth day of each month, after  reserving  such
  amount  for  such  refunds and deducting such amounts for such costs, as
  provided for in subdivision (a) of this section, the commissioner  shall
  certify to the comptroller the amount of revenues so received during the
  prior  month  as  a  result  of the surcharge, interest and penalties so
  imposed. Notwithstanding any provision of law  to  the  contrary,  after
  deducting  the  amounts  specified  in  the previous sentence, the first
  three  hundred  sixty-two  million  dollars  collected  or  received  in
  calendar year two thousand nineteen, the first three hundred one million
  dollars  collected or received in calendar year two thousand twenty, and
  the first three hundred million dollars collected or  received  in  each
  calendar year thereafter, shall be deposited by the comptroller, without
  appropriation,  pursuant  to  subdivision  (c) of this section. The next
  fifty million  dollars  collected  or  received  in  calendar  year  two
  thousand  nineteen,  and  in  each  year  thereafter, in excess of funds
  collected and deposited pursuant to subdivision  (c)  of  this  section,
  shall  be  deposited by the comptroller, without appropriation, pursuant
  to  subdivision  (d)  of  this  section,  provided,  however,  that  any
  uncommitted  fund  balance  at the end of each calendar year through the
  approval  process  of  subdivision  three  of  section  twelve   hundred
  seventy-i of the public authorities law shall be transferred on the last
  business  day  of  the  calendar year by the metropolitan transportation
  authority from the outer borough transportation account to  the  general
  transportation  account  of  the New York city transportation assistance
  fund  created  by  section  twelve  hundred  seventy-i  of  the   public
  authorities  law.  Any  amounts collected or received, in any year, that
  are in excess of the amounts deposited pursuant to subdivisions (c)  and
  (d)  of  this  section,  shall  be deposited by the comptroller, without
  appropriation, pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section.
    (c) The amount of revenues so certified shall  be  paid  over  by  the
  fifteenth  business  day  of  each  succeeding  month from such account,
  without appropriation, into the subway action plan account  of  the  New
  York city transportation assistance fund established pursuant to section
  twelve hundred seventy-i of the public authorities law.
    (d)  The  amount  of  revenues  so certified that are in excess of the
  amounts deposited as provided in subdivision (c) of this section,  shall
  be paid over by the fifteenth business day of each succeeding month from
  such   account,   without   appropriation,   into   the   outer  borough
  transportation account of the New York  city  transportation  assistance
  fund  established  pursuant  to  section twelve hundred seventy-i of the
  public authorities law.


   (e) The amount of revenues so certified that  are  in  excess  of  the
  amounts  deposited  as  provided  in  subdivisions  (c)  and (d) of this
  section, shall be paid over  by  the  fifteenth  business  day  of  each
  succeeding  month  from  such  account,  without appropriation, into the
  general  transportation  account  of  the  New  York city transportation
  assistance fund established pursuant to section twelve hundred seventy-i
  of the public authorities law.
    (f)  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  law  to  the  contrary,  any
  surcharge  imposed  by  this  article  that  is  paid in connection with
  transportation provided to persons eligible for medical  assistance  who
  are  transported  pursuant  to section three hundred sixty-five-h of the
  social services law shall be transferred on a quarterly basis  from  the
  account  specified  in  paragraph  (a)  of  this section to the Medicaid
  management information system escrow fund. The  commissioner  of  health
  shall collect the Medicaid transportation data necessary to determine an
  amount  to  be transferred each quarter; provided that such amount shall
  be reconciled in the  subsequent  quarter  to  reflect  actual  Medicaid
  surcharge expenditures; and further provided that any difference between
  the  amount  transferred  and the reconciled amount shall be added to or
  subtracted from the amount transferred in the following quarter.




   §  1299-I. Cooperation by regulatory agencies. All regulatory agencies
  shall cooperate with and  assist  the  commissioner  to  effectuate  the
  purposes   of  this  article  and  the  commissioner's  responsibilities
  hereunder. Such cooperation shall  include  obtaining,  furnishing,  and
  timely  updating current, complete and accurate names, addresses and all
  other  information  concerning:  (1)  every  for-hire   vehicle   owner,
  operator,  and driver of for-hire vehicles licensed or permitted by such
  licensing agency; (2) every agent of such person, if any;  and  (3)  any
  other  person  or entity that is licensed or permitted by such licensing
  agency.  Such  cooperation  shall  also  include   furnishing   to   the
  commissioner  all written, computerized, automated or electronic records
  in the regulatory agency's possession, or in the possession  of  any  of
  its   agents,   instrumentalities,  contractors,  or  any  other  person
  authorized or required to obtain or possess such records or information,
  that account for any transportation and operation for hire provided by a
  licensed or permitted  person  or  entity.  Such  information  shall  be
  provided to the commissioner without cost, and in a format prescribed by
  the commissioner.






















































   §  1300.  Short title. This article shall be known and may be cited as
  the "city personal income tax".




   §  1301.  Authority  to  impose taxes.   (a) Notwithstanding any other
  provision of law to the contrary,  any  city  in  this  state  having  a
  population  of one million or more inhabitants, acting through its local
  legislative body, is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt and  amend
  local  laws imposing in any such city, for taxable years beginning after
  nineteen hundred seventy-five:
    (1) a tax on the personal income of residents of  such  city,  at  the
  rates provided for under subsection (a) of section thirteen hundred four
  of  this  article  for  taxable  years  beginning  before  two  thousand
  twenty-seven, and at the rates provided  for  under  subsection  (b)  of
  section  thirteen  hundred  four  of  this  article  for  taxable  years
  beginning after two thousand twenty-six, provided, however, that if, for
  any taxable year beginning after two thousand twenty-six, the rates  set
  forth in such subsection (b) are rendered inapplicable and the rates set
  forth  in  such subsection (a) are rendered applicable, then the tax for
  such taxable year shall be at the rates provided under subparagraphs (A)
  of paragraphs one, two and three of such subsection (a),
    (2) for taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred seventy-six,  a
  separate tax on the ordinary income portion of lump sum distributions of
  such  residents,  at  the  rates  provided  for herein, such taxes to be
  administered, collected and distributed by the commissioner as  provided
  for in this article.
    (b) All the provisions of the local laws imposing the taxes authorized

  memorandum  of  understanding.  If  such  percentage  of non-achievement
  exceeds two percent with respect to the fiscal year of such city  ending
  no  later  than  June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-seven, then the
  rates of the tax surcharge authorized by this section  for  the  taxable
  years  beginning  in  the  calendar  year  beginning  on  January first,
  nineteen hundred ninety-eight shall be the products  of  the  rates  set

  implementation  of  such  programs  in accordance with the memorandum of

  local  law  imposing  those taxes to the taxes imposed by that local law
  shall be deemed also to refer to the filing fee imposed pursuant to  the
  authority of this section.
    (b)  Any  local law imposing the filing fee authorized by this section
  shall provide that every partnership having any income derived from city
  sources, determined in accordance with the applicable rules  of  section
  six  hundred  thirty-one  of  this  chapter  as  in  the case of a state
  nonresident individual (except that in  making  such  determination  any
  references  in  such  section to "New York source" or "New York sources"
  shall be read as references to "New York city source" or "New York  city
  sources"  and  any  references  in  such section to "this state" or "the
  state" shall be read as references to "this city" or "the city"),  shall
  make  a  return  for the taxable year setting forth all items of income,
  gain, loss and deduction and such other  pertinent  information  as  the
  commissioner  may by regulations and instructions prescribe. Such return
  shall be filed on or before  the  fifteenth  day  of  the  fourth  month
  following  the  close  of each taxable year except that the due date for
  the  return  of  a  partnership  consisting  entirely   of   nonresident
  noncitizens  shall  be the date prescribed for the filing of its federal
  partnership  return  for  the  taxable  year.  For  purposes   of   this
  subsection,  "taxable  year"  means  a year or a period which would be a
  taxable year of the partnership if it were subject to the taxes  imposed
  under the authority of this article.
    (c)  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this section, any filing fee
  imposed pursuant to the authority of this section shall be  administered
  and  collected  by the commissioner in the same manner as the filing fee
  imposed by paragraph three of subsection  (c)  of  section  six  hundred
  fifty-eight  of  this chapter, and shall be deposited and disposed of in
  the same manner as taxes pursuant to the provisions of section  thirteen
  hundred thirteen of this article.


   (d)  Any  local law imposing the filing fee authorized by this section
  shall apply to taxable years beginning on or  after  the  ninetieth  day
  after the effective date of this section.

  supplemental  tax in addition to the tax imposed under subsection (a) of
  this section for the purpose of  recapturing  the  benefit  of  the  tax
  tables  contained  in such subsection.  The supplemental tax shall be an
  amount equal to the sum of the tax table benefits in paragraphs one  and
  two  of this subsection multiplied by their respective fractions in such
  paragraphs provided, however, that  paragraph  one  of  this  subsection


 shall  not  apply to taxpayers who are not subject to the second highest
  rate of tax.
    (1)  Resident  married  individuals  filing  joint  returns, surviving
  spouses, resident heads of households, resident  unmarried  individuals,
  resident  married  individuals  filing  separate  returns  and  resident
  estates and trusts. (A) The tax table benefit is the difference  between
  (i)  the  amount  of  taxable  income  set  forth  in  the  tax table in
  subsection (a) of this section not subject to the second highest rate of
  tax for the taxable year multiplied by such rate  and  (ii)  the  second
  highest  dollar  denominated  tax  for such amount of taxable income set
  forth in the tax table applicable to the taxable year in subsection  (a)
  of this section.
    (B)  The  fraction is computed as follows: the numerator is the lesser
  of fifty thousand dollars or the  excess  of  New  York  adjusted  gross
  income  for the taxable year over one hundred fifty thousand dollars and
  the denominator is fifty thousand dollars.
    (C) This paragraph shall only apply to taxable years  beginning  after
  two thousand two and before two thousand six.
    (2)  Resident  married  individuals  filing  joint  returns, surviving
  spouses, resident heads of households, resident  unmarried  individuals,
  resident  married  individuals  filing  separate  returns  and  resident
  estates and trusts. (A) The tax table benefit is the difference  between
  (i)  the  amount  of  taxable  income  set  forth  in  the  tax table in
  subsection (a) of this section not subject to the highest  rate  of  tax
  for the taxable year multiplied by such rate and (ii) the highest dollar
  denominated  tax  set  forth  in the tax table applicable to the taxable
  year in subsection (a) of this section less the sum  of  the  tax  table
  benefits in paragraph one of this subsection.
    (B)  For  such  taxpayers with adjusted gross income over five hundred
  thousand dollars, the fraction is one.    Provided,  however,  that  the
  total  tax  prior to the application of any tax credits shall not exceed
  the highest rate of tax set forth in the tax table in subsection (a)  of
  this section multiplied by the taxpayer's taxable income.
    (C)  This  paragraph shall only apply to taxable years beginning after
  two thousand two and before two thousand six.

      (B) a person domiciled in such  city  at  the  time  such  trust  or
    portion  of  a trust became irrevocable, if it was revocable when such
    property was transferred to the  trust  but  has  subsequently  become
    irrevocable.
    For  the  purposes  of the foregoing, a trust or portion of a trust is
  revocable if it is subject to a power, exercisable immediately or at any
  future time, to revest title in the person  whose  property  constitutes
  such  trust  or  portion  of  a  trust and a trust or portion of a trust
  becomes  irrevocable  when  the  possibility  that  such  power  may  be
  exercised has been terminated.
    (d)  City  nonresident  estate  or trust. A city nonresident estate or
  trust means an estate or trust which is not a resident of such city.




   §  1306.  Returns  and  liabilities.  (a)  General.  On  or before the
  fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of a taxable year,
  an income tax return under a city tax imposed pursuant to the  authority
  of  this  article  shall be made and filed by or for every city resident
  individual, estate or trust required to file a New York  state  personal
  income tax (including a city separate tax on the ordinary income portion
  of lump sum distributions) return for the taxable year.
    (b)  Husband  and  wife. (1) If the New York state personal income tax
  liability of husband and wife is determined on a separate return,  their
  city personal income tax liabilities and returns shall be separate.
    (2)  If  the New York state personal income tax liabilities of husband
  and wife (other than a husband and wife described  in  paragraph  three)
  are  determined on a joint return, they shall file a joint city personal
  income tax return, and their tax liabilities shall be joint and  several
  except  as  provided  in  paragraph five of this subsection, section six
  hundred fifty-four and subsection (e) of section six hundred eighty-five
  of this chapter.
    (3) If either husband or wife is a city resident and the  other  is  a
  city   nonresident,  and  their  New  York  state  personal  income  tax
  liabilities are determined on a joint return:
    (A) they may elect to file a joint city personal income tax return  as
  if  both  were  residents,  in which case their city personal income tax
  liabilities shall be joint and several except as provided  in  paragraph
  five  of  this subsection, section six hundred fifty-four and subsection
  (e) of section six hundred eighty-five of this chapter, or
    (B) the resident spouse may elect to file  a  separate  city  personal
  income  tax return, in which case his city personal income tax liability
  shall be determined as if he were  filing  a  separate  New  York  state
  personal income tax return.
    (5)  If  a joint return has been made under this subsection for a tax-
  able year and only one spouse is  liable  for  past-due  support  or  an
  amount  of  a  default  in  repayment  of  a  guaranteed  student, state
  university or city university loan of which the state tax commission has
  been notified pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-c, one hundred
  seventy-one-d or one hundred seventy-one-e of this chapter, as the  case
  may  be,  then  an  overpayment  and  interest thereon shall be credited
  against such past-due support or such amount of a default  in  repayment
  of  a  guaranteed  student,  state  university  or city university loan,
  unless the spouse not liable for such past-due support or such amount of
  a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city
  university loan demands,  on  a  declaration  made  in  accordance  with
  regulations or instructions prescribed by the state tax commission, that
  the  portion of the overpayment and interest attributable to such spouse
  not be credited against the past-due support or amount of a  default  in
  repayment  of  a guaranteed student, state university or city university
  loan owed  by  the  other  spouse.  Upon  such  demand,  the  state  tax
  commission shall determine the amount of the overpayment attributable to
  each  spouse  in accordance with regulations prescribed by the state tax
  commission and credit only that portion of the overpayment and  interest
  thereon attributable to the spouse liable for past-due support or amount
  of  a  default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or
  city university loan against such past-due support or such amount  of  a
  default  in  repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city
  university loan.
    (6) The commissioner shall clearly alert  married  taxpayers,  on  all
  appropriate  publications and instructions, that their liability for tax
  will be joint and several if they file joint  income  tax  returns.  The
  commissioner  shall  include  notice  of an individual's right to relief


 from joint  and  several  liability  pursuant  to  section  six  hundred
  fifty-four  of  this  chapter  in  the  disclosure  of  rights statement
  required by section three thousand four  of  this  chapter  and  in  any
  notice  regarding collection of tax due with respect to a liability on a
  joint return.
    (c) Decedents. The return for any deceased individual  shall  be  made
  and  filed  by his executor, administrator, or other person charged with
  his property. If a final return of a decedent is for a  fractional  part
  of a year, the due date of such return shall be the fifteenth day of the
  fourth  month following the close of the twelve-month period which began
  with the first day of such fractional part of the year.
    (d) Individuals under a disability. The return for an  individual  who
  is  unable  to  make  a return by reason of minority or other disability
  shall be made and filed by his guardian, committee, fiduciary  or  other
  person  charged  with  the  care of his person or property (other than a
  receiver in possession of only a part of his property), or by  his  duly
  authorized agent.
    (e)  Estates  and  trusts.  The return for an estate or trust shall be
  made and filed by the fiduciary.
    (f) Joint fiduciaries. If two or more fiduciaries are acting  jointly,
  the return may be made by any one of them.




   §  1307.  Change  of  resident  status.  (a) General. If an individual
  changes his status during his taxable year from city  resident  to  city
  nonresident,  or  from  city nonresident to city resident, he shall file
  one return as a city resident for the portion of the year  during  which
  he is a city resident, and a return under a local law for the portion of
  the  year  during  which  he  is  a  city  nonresident,  subject to such
  exceptions as the state tax commission may prescribe by regulation. Such
  return shall be due at the same time as the return for  the  portion  of
  the year during which such individual is a city resident.
    (b)  The  city taxable income for the portion of the year during which
  an individual described in subsection (a) is a city resident  individual
  shall  be  determined,  except  as provided in subsection (c), under the
  rules provided in section six hundred thirty-eight of this  chapter,  as
  if  he  were  computing his New York taxable income and his taxable year
  for New York state personal income tax  purposes  were  limited  to  the
  period of his city resident status.
    (c)  When  an individual changes his status from city resident to city
  nonresident, or from  city  nonresident  to  city  resident,  he  shall,
  regardless  of  his  method  of  accounting, accrue any items of income,
  gain,  loss,  deduction  or  ordinary  income  portion  of  a  lump  sum
  distribution accruing prior to the change of status, with the applicable
  modifications  and  adjustments  to  federal  adjusted  gross income and
  itemized deductions under sections six hundred twelve  and  six  hundred
  fifteen,  if not otherwise properly includible or allowable for New York
  income tax purposes for such period or a prior taxable  year  under  his
  method of accounting. Such accruals shall be made as provided in section
  six hundred thirty-nine of this chapter.
    (d)  Trusts.  If the status of a trust changes during its taxable year
  from city resident to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city
  resident, the fiduciary shall file one return as a city  resident  trust
  for  the  portion  of the year during which the trust is a city resident
  trust, and a return under a local law for the portion of the year during
  which the trust is a city nonresident trust, subject to such  exceptions
  as the state tax commission may prescribe by regulations.
    (e) The city taxable income for the portion of the year during which a
  trust  described  in  subsection  (d)  is a city resident trust shall be
  determined, except as  provided  in  subsection  (c),  under  the  rules
  provided  in section six hundred thirty-eight of this chapter, as if its
  New York taxable income were being computed and its taxable year for New
  York state personal income tax purposes were limited to  the  period  of
  its city resident status.
    (f)  When  the  status  of  a trust changes from city resident to city
  nonresident, or from  city  nonresident  to  city  resident,  it  shall,
  regardless  of  its  method  of  accounting, accrue any items of income,
  gain, loss or deduction accruing prior to the  change  of  status.  Such
  accruals shall be made as provided in section six hundred thirty-nine of
  this chapter.






	   §  1309.  Requirement  of  withholding  tax  from wages. A tax imposed
  pursuant to the authority of this article shall  provide  that  the  tax
  shall  be  withheld  from the wages of city residents in the same manner
  and subject to the same requirements, to the greatest  extent  possible,
  as  provided  in  sections  six  hundred seventy-one through six hundred
  seventy-eight of this chapter except that the  term  "aggregate  amount"
  contained  in paragraphs one, two and three of subsection (a) of section
  six hundred seventy-four of this chapter shall mean the aggregate of the
  aggregate amounts of New York state personal income tax,  city  personal
  income tax on residents and city earnings tax on nonresidents authorized
  pursuant  to  article  two-E  of  the  general  city  law required to be
  deducted and withheld and provided, however, that the provisions of such
  paragraphs shall not be applicable to employer's returns required to  be
  filed  with respect to taxes required to be deducted and withheld during
  the calendar year nineteen hundred seventy-six, but such  returns  shall
  be  required  to be filed with the state tax commission at the times and
  in the manner provided for in  subdivision  (a)  of  section  fifty-four
  contained  in  section  twenty-five-a of the general city law except the
  term "administrator" in such subdivision shall be  read  as  "state  tax
  commission."




   § 1310. Credits against tax. (a) Credit to trust beneficiary receiving
  accumulation  distribution. A beneficiary of a trust who is subject to a
  city personal income tax imposed  pursuant  to  the  authority  of  this
  article   and  whose  New  York  adjusted  gross  income  under  article
  twenty-two of this chapter includes  all  or  part  of  an  accumulation
  distribution by such trust, as defined in section six hundred sixty-five
  of  the internal revenue code, shall be allowed a credit against the tax
  otherwise due  under  such  city  personal  income  tax  for  all  or  a
  proportionate  part of any tax paid by the trust under such tax or under
  any prior local law of the city for any  preceding  taxable  year  which
  would  not have been payable if the trust had in fact made distributions
  to its beneficiaries at the  times  and  in  the  amounts  specified  in
  section  six  hundred sixty-six of the internal revenue code. The credit
  under this subsection shall not reduce the tax otherwise  due  from  the
  beneficiary  under  such city personal income tax to an amount less than
  would have been due if the accumulation distribution or his part thereof
  were excluded from his New York adjusted  gross  income  as  defined  in
  section six hundred twelve of this chapter.
    (b)  Credit  for  tax withheld. Wages upon which tax is required to be
  withheld shall be taxable under a city personal  income  tax  as  if  no
  withholding  were  required, but any amount of tax actually deducted and
  withheld under such tax in any calendar year shall  be  deemed  to  have
  been  paid to the state tax commission on behalf of the person from whom
  withheld, and such person shall be credited with having paid that amount
  of tax for the taxable year beginning  in  such  calendar  year.  For  a
  taxable  year of less than twelve months, the credit shall be made under
  regulations of the state tax commission.
    (c) Credit relating to net capital gain. For taxable  years  beginning
  in  nineteen  hundred  eighty-seven,  a credit against the city personal
  income tax determined in accordance with section thirteen  hundred  four
  shall  be  allowed.  The  amount  of the credit shall be one-half of one
  percent of net capital gain includible in city adjusted gross income for
  the taxable year. The credit allowed by this section  shall  not  exceed
  the  tax  determined  in  accordance with section thirteen hundred four,
  reduced by the credits permitted under subsections (a) and (d)  of  this
  section.
    (d)  Household  credit. (1) For taxable years beginning after nineteen
  hundred eighty-six, a  credit  against  the  city  personal  income  tax
  determined  in  accordance  with  section thirteen hundred four shall be
  allowed. The credit, computed as described  in  paragraph  two  of  this
  subsection,  shall  not  exceed  the  tax  determined in accordance with
  section thirteen hundred four reduced  by  the  credit  permitted  under
  subsection (a) of this section.
    (2)  (A)  For  any  individual  who  is  not married nor the head of a
  household nor a surviving spouse, the amount  of  the  credit  shall  be
  determined in accordance with the following table:
 
  If household gross                 The credit shall be:
     income is:
                              For taxable years       For taxable years
                             beginning after 1986      beginning after
                               and before 1996              1995
 
  Not over $7,500                   $15                      $15
  Over $7,500 but not
   over $10,000                     $10                      $15
  Over $10,000 but not
   over $12,500                     $ 0                      $10


   (B)  For  any husband and wife, head of household or surviving spouse,
  the amount of the credit shall be determined by multiplying  the  number
  of  exemptions  for  which the taxpayer (or in the case of a husband and
  wife, taxpayers) is entitled to a deduction for  the  taxable  year  for
  federal income tax purposes under subsections (b) and (c) of section one
  hundred  fifty-one of the internal revenue code by the credit factor for
  the taxable year as specified in the following table:

                                                                1995
  Not over $12,500         $30    $50         $50                $30
  Over $12,500 but not

    over $22,500           $ 0    $ 0         $ 0                $10
 
    (3) For purposes of this subsection:
    (A) "Household gross income" shall mean the aggregate federal adjusted
  gross income of a  household,  as  the  term  household  is  defined  in
  subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, for the taxable year.
    (B) "Household"  means  a  husband  and  wife,  a head of household, a
  surviving spouse, or an individual who is not married nor the head of  a
  household  nor  a surviving spouse nor a taxpayer with respect to whom a
  deduction under subsection (c) of section one hundred fifty-one  of  the
  internal  revenue  code is allowable to another taxpayer for the taxable
  year.
    (C) "Household gross income of  a  husband  and  wife"  shall  be  the
  aggregate  of  their federal adjusted gross incomes for the taxable year
  irrespective of whether joint or separate city income  tax  returns  are
  filed. Provided, however, that a husband or wife who is required to file
  a separate city income tax return shall be permitted one-half the credit
  otherwise  allowed  his or her household, except as limited by paragraph
  one of this subsection.
    (D) "Household gross income" shall be computed in all cases as if each
  member of the household were a resident for the entire taxable year.
    (E) If a taxpayer changes his status  during  his  taxable  year  from
  resident  to nonresident, or from nonresident to resident, the household
  credit shall be prorated according to the number of months in the period
  of residence. In the case of a husband  and  wife,  if  either  or  both
  changes  his  or  her  status  from  resident  to  nonresident  or  from
  nonresident to resident and  separate  returns  are  filed,  the  credit
  computed  for  the  entire  year  shall  be divided first as provided in
  subparagraph (C) of this paragraph and then prorated  according  to  the
  number of months in the period of residence.
    * (e)  State  school  tax  reduction  credit.    (1) For taxable years
  beginning after nineteen hundred ninety-seven,  and  ending  before  two
  thousand  sixteen,  a state school tax reduction credit shall be allowed
  as provided in the following tables. The credit shall be allowed against
  the taxes authorized by this article reduced by the credits permitted by
  this article. If the credit exceeds the tax as so reduced, the  taxpayer
  may  receive,  and  the  comptroller,  subject  to  a certificate of the


 commissioner, shall pay as an overpayment, without interest, the  amount
  of  such  excess.  For  purposes  of this subsection, no credit shall be
  granted to  an  individual  with  respect  to  whom  a  deduction  under
  subsection  (c) of section one hundred fifty-one of the internal revenue
  code is allowable to another taxpayer for the taxable year.
    (2) The amount of the credit under this paragraph shall be  determined
  based  upon  the  taxpayer's  income  as defined in subparagraph (ii) of
  paragraph (b) of subdivision four of section four hundred twenty-five of
  the real property tax law. For  the  purposes  of  this  paragraph,  any
  taxpayer  under  subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph with income
  of more than two hundred fifty thousand  dollars  shall  not  receive  a
  credit.
    Beginning  in  the  two  thousand  ten  tax  year  and  each  tax year
  thereafter through two thousand fifteen,  the  "more  than  two  hundred
  fifty  thousand  dollar" income limitation shall be adjusted by applying
  the inflation factor set forth herein, and rounding each result  to  the
  nearest  multiple of one hundred dollars. The department shall establish
  the income limitation to be associated with each subsequent tax year  by
  applying  the  inflation  factor  set  forth  herein to the figures that
  define the income limitation that were applicable to the  preceding  tax
  year,  as  determined  pursuant  to  this  subsection, and rounding each
  result  to  the  nearest  multiple  of   one   hundred   dollars.   Such
  determination  shall be made no later than March first, two thousand ten
  and each year thereafter.
    (A) Married individuals filing joint returns and surviving spouses. In
  the case of a husband and wife who make a single return jointly and of a
  surviving spouse:
       For taxable years beginning:       The credit shall be:
                 in 2001-2005                    $125
                 in 2006                         $230
                 in 2007-2008                    $290
                 in 2009 - 2015                  $125

                 in 2006                         $115
                 in 2007-2008                    $145
                 in 2009 - 2015                  $62.50
    (4)  Husband  and  wife who make a joint return. If a husband and wife
  make a single return jointly, the credit under this subsection shall  be
  determined under paragraph two of this subsection, if either of them has
  attained  the  age  of  sixty-five on or before the close of the taxable
  year.
    (5) Part-year residents. If  a  taxpayer  changes  status  during  the
  taxable  year  from  resident  to  nonresident,  or  from nonresident to
  resident, the state  school  tax  reduction  credit  shall  be  prorated
  according to the number of months in the period of residence.

    * (e) Credit for city of New York unincorporated business tax paid.
    (1)  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of law to the contrary, any
  city imposing  a  tax  under  this  article  is  hereby  authorized  and
  empowered  to  adopt and amend local laws for any taxable year beginning
  after nineteen hundred ninety-seven, as specified in  such  local  laws,
  providing  for  a credit as provided in paragraph two of this subsection
  against the taxes imposed pursuant to the authority granted  by  section
  thirteen  hundred  one  of  this  article  on  the  city  taxable income
  determined pursuant to sections thirteen hundred four, thirteen  hundred


 four-A  and  thirteen hundred four-B of this article and on the ordinary
  income portion of a lump sum distribution determined pursuant to section
  thirteen hundred one-B of this article, to any city resident individual,

  loss or deductions from one or more unincorporated businesses  conducted
  by  such  city  resident  individual,  estate or trust on which a tax is
  imposed by chapter five of title eleven of the  administrative  code  of
  the  city of New York, or a distributive share of income, gain, loss and
  deductions of, or guaranteed payments from, one or more partnerships  on
  which  a tax is imposed by such chapter. Any such local laws may contain
  provisions to ensure that such credit shall not reduce the tax paid by a
  city resident below that which would be paid by such  city  resident  if
  such city resident were a city nonresident.
    (2)  (A)  Subject  to  the limitation set forth in subparagraph (B) of
  this paragraph, the credit allowed to a  taxpayer  for  a  taxable  year
  shall be equal to all or a portion of the amount determined in paragraph
  three  of  this subsection, provided, however, such portion shall not be
  less than:
    (i) If the city taxable income is forty-two thousand dollars or  less,
  sixty-five  percent  of the amount determined in paragraph three of this
  subsection.

  percentage  of  the  amount  determined  in  paragraph  three  of   this
  subsection  to be determined by subtracting from sixty-five percent, one
  tenth of a percentage point (.001) for every increment  of  two  hundred
  dollars, or fractional part thereof, of city taxable income in excess of
  forty-two thousand dollars.
    (iii) If the city taxable income is greater than one hundred forty-two
  thousand  dollars, fifteen percent of the amount determined in paragraph
  three of this subsection.
    (B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  subparagraph  (A)  of
  this  paragraph,  the  credit  allowed  to a taxpayer for a taxable year
  under this subsection shall not exceed the sum of the taxes  that  would
  otherwise  be imposed on such taxpayer for such taxable year pursuant to
  the authority granted by section thirteen hundred one of this article on
  the city taxable income determined pursuant to sections thirteen hundred
  four, thirteen hundred  four-A  and  thirteen  hundred  four-B  of  this
  article  and  on  the ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution
  determined pursuant to section thirteen hundred one-B of  this  article,
  reduced  by the credits allowed to such taxpayer pursuant to subsections
  (a), (c) and (d) of this section.

  the amount determined in this paragraph is the sum of:
    (A)  for  each  unincorporated business conducted by the taxpayer, the
  tax imposed by chapter five of title eleven of the  administrative  code
  of  the city of New York on such unincorporated business for its taxable
  year ending with the taxable year  of  the  taxpayer  and  paid  by  the
  unincorporated business; and
    (B)  for  each  unincorporated  business  in  which  the taxpayer is a
  partner, the product of:
    (i) the sum of (I) the tax imposed by chapter five of title eleven  of
  the  administrative  code of the city of New York on such unincorporated
  business for its taxable year ending within or with the taxable year  of
  the  partner and paid by the unincorporated business and (II) the amount
  of any credit or credits taken  by  the  unincorporated  business  under
  subdivision (j) of section 11-503 of the administrative code of the city


 of  New York for its taxable year ending within or with the taxable year
  of the partner; and
    (ii)  a  fraction,  the  numerator  of  which  is the net total of the
  partner's distributive share of income, gain, loss  and  deductions  of,
  and  guaranteed  payments  from,  the  unincorporated  business for such
  taxable year, and the denominator of which is the sum, for such  taxable
  year,  of  the  net  total distributive shares of income, gain, loss and
  deductions  of,  and  guaranteed  payments  to,  all  partners  in   the
  unincorporated  business for whom or which such net total (as separately
  determined for each partner) is greater than zero.
    (C) For a taxpayer that changes its status from a city resident  to  a
  city  nonresident  or  from a city nonresident to a city resident during
  the taxable year:
    (i) the amount determined in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph  shall
  be,  with  respect  to  each  unincorporated  business  conducted by the
  taxpayer, the tax imposed  by  chapter  five  of  title  eleven  of  the
  administrative  code  of  the  city  of  New York on such unincorporated
  business for its taxable year  ending  with  the  taxable  year  of  the
  taxpayer  and  paid  by  the  unincorporated  business,  multiplied by a
  fraction, the numerator of which is that portion of  the  income,  gain,
  loss  and  deductions  of  the  unincorporated  business included in the
  taxpayer's city adjusted gross income for the  portion  of  the  taxable
  year  during which the taxpayer was a city resident, and the denominator
  of which is the total, for such taxable year, of the income, gain,  loss
  and deductions of the unincorporated business, and
    (ii)  the amount determined in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this
  paragraph shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is that portion of
  the taxpayer's net total distributive share of income,  gain,  loss  and
  deductions  of,  and  that  portion  of  guaranteed  payments  from, the
  unincorporated business included in the taxpayer's city  adjusted  gross
  income for the portion of the taxable year during which the taxpayer was
  a  city  resident,  and  the  denominator  of which is the sum, for such
  taxable year, of the net total distributive shares of income, gain, loss
  and deductions of, and guaranteed  payments  to,  all  partners  in  the
  unincorporated business, for whom or which such net total (as separately
  determined for each partner) is greater than zero.
    (4)  No local law enacted pursuant to the authority of this subsection
  shall be effective unless a certified copy of such local law  is  mailed
  by  registered  mail  to the state department of taxation and finance at
  its office in Albany at least fifteen days prior to the date  it  is  to
  become  effective. However, the state department of taxation and finance
  may waive and reduce such fifteen-day minimum notice  requirement  to  a
  mailing  of such certified copy by registered mail within such period if
  it deems such action  to  be  consistent  with  its  duties  under  this
  article.
    * NB There are 2 sub§ (e)'s
    (f) Earned income tax credit.  (1) Notwithstanding any other provision
  of  law  to the contrary, any city having a population of one million or
  more, acting through its local legislative body,  is  hereby  authorized
  and  empowered  to adopt and amend local laws granting in any such city,
  for taxable years beginning after two thousand three, a  credit  against
  the  city personal income tax equal to five percent of the earned income
  credit allowed under section thirty-two of the internal revenue code for
  the same taxable year,  and,  for  taxable  years  beginning  after  two
  thousand twenty-one, a credit against the city personal income tax equal
  to a percentage, determined pursuant to subparagraphs (A) through (I) of
  this  paragraph,  of  the  earned  income  credit  allowed under section
  thirty-two of the internal revenue code for the same taxable  year.  For


 purposes  of  this  paragraph,  "adjusted  gross  income" means New York
  adjusted gross income as determined pursuant to  article  twenty-two  of
  this chapter. The percentage shall be:
    (A)  thirty  percent,  where  the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for
  such taxable year is less than $5,000;
    (B)  thirty  percent  reduced  by  the  product  of  two-tenths  of  a
  percentage point (0.002) and the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted gross
  income  for such taxable year in excess of $4,999, where such taxpayer's
  adjusted gross income for such taxable year is equal to or greater  than
  $5,000 and less than $7,500;
    (C)  twenty-five  percent,  where the taxpayer's adjusted gross income
  for such taxable year is equal to or greater than $7,500 and  less  than
  $15,000;
    (D)  twenty-five  percent  reduced  by  the product of two-tenths of a
  percentage point (0.002) and the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted gross
  income for such taxable year in excess of $14,999, where such taxpayer's
  adjusted gross income for such taxable year is equal to or greater  than
  $15,000 and less than $17,500;
    (E)  twenty  percent,  where  the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for
  such taxable year is equal to or greater  than  $17,500  and  less  than
  $20,000;
    (F)  twenty  percent  reduced  by  the  product  of  two-tenths  of  a
  percentage point (0.002) and the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted gross
  income for such taxable year in excess of $19,999, where such taxpayer's
  adjusted gross income for such taxable year is equal to or greater  than
  $20,000 and less than $22,500;
    (G)  fifteen  percent,  where the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for
  such taxable year is equal to or greater  than  $22,500  and  less  than
  $40,000;
    (H)  fifteen  percent  reduced  by  the  product  of  two-tenths  of a
  percentage point (0.002) and the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted gross
  income for such taxable year in excess of $39,999, where such taxpayer's
  adjusted gross income for such taxable year is equal to or greater  than
  $40,000 and less than $42,500; and
    (I)  ten  percent  where the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for such
  taxable year is equal to or greater than $42,500.
    (2) In the case of a resident taxpayer, the credit provided  by  local
  law  adopted  pursuant  to  this subsection shall be allowed against the
  taxes authorized by this article for the taxable  year  reduced  by  the
  credits  permitted  by this article. If the credit exceeds the tax as so
  reduced, the taxpayer may receive, and the  comptroller,  subject  to  a
  certificate  of  the  commissioner, shall pay as an overpayment, without
  interest, the amount of such excess.
    (3) If a taxpayer changes his or her status during  the  taxable  year
  from city resident to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city
  resident,  the  credit determined under this subsection shall be limited
  to the amount determined by multiplying the amount of such credit  by  a
  fraction,  the numerator of which is such taxpayer's city adjusted gross
  income,  as  defined  in  chapter  seventeen  of  title  eleven  of  the
  administrative  code  of  the  city  of  New  York,  for  the  period of
  residence, and the denominator of which is such taxpayer's city adjusted
  gross income determined as if he or she were a  city  resident  for  the
  entire  taxable  year.  City  adjusted gross income shall be adjusted as
  provided in section 11-1754 of the administrative code of  the  city  of
  New  York.  The  credit  as  so  limited shall be applied as provided in
  paragraph two of this subsection.
    (4) Subject to the provisions of paragraph three of  this  subsection,
  in  the  case of a husband and wife who file a joint return, but who are


 required to determine their city personal income taxes  separately,  the
  credit authorized pursuant to this subsection may be applied against the
  tax  of either or divided between them as they may elect. In the case of
  a  husband  and  wife who are not required to file a federal return, the
  credit under this subsection shall be allowed  only  if  such  taxpayers
  file a joint city personal income tax return.
    (5)  A  local  law  enacted  pursuant  to  this  subsection  shall  be
  applicable with respect to any taxable year only if it has been  enacted
  on  or  before the date that is forty-five days after the effective date
  of this subsection and for taxable years subsequent to taxable year  two
  thousand  four,  on  or before July thirty-first of such taxable year. A
  certified copy of such local law shall be mailed by registered  mail  to
  the  state  department  of  taxation and finance at its office in Albany
  within fifteen days of its enactment. However, the state  department  of
  taxation  and  finance may allow additional time for such certified copy
  to be mailed if it deems such action to be consistent  with  its  duties
  under this article.
    (6)  If  the  department  determines  that the taxpayer is eligible to
  receive the credit provided under this subsection but  has  not  claimed
  such credit on his or her return, the department shall compute and issue
  any   refund  for  the  allowable  credit  amount  provided  under  this
  subsection. Any refund paid pursuant to this paragraph shall  be  deemed
  to  be  a  refund  of  an  overpayment of tax as provided in section six
  hundred eighty-six of this chapter, provided, however, that no  interest
  shall be paid thereon.
    (g)  Credit  for city pass-through entity tax. (1) A taxpayer who is a
  partner or member  of  an  electing  city  partnership  and  a  taxpayer
  shareholder  of  an  electing city resident S corporation subject to tax
  under article twenty-four-B of this  chapter  shall  be  entitled  to  a
  credit against the tax imposed pursuant to the authority of this article
  as  provided  in  this  subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the
  terms  "electing  city   partnership,"   "electing   city   resident   S
  corporation,"  "city pass-through entity tax," and "direct share of city
  pass-through entity tax"  shall  have  the  same  meanings  provided  in
  article twenty-four-B of this chapter.
    (2) The amount of the credit shall be equal to the partner's, member's
  or shareholder's direct share of the city pass-through entity tax.
    (3) If a taxpayer is a partner, member or shareholder in more than one
  electing  city  partnership  and/or electing city resident S corporation
  that is subject  to  tax  pursuant  to  article  twenty-four-B  of  this
  chapter, the amount of the credit of such taxpayer shall be equal to the
  sum  of the amounts of such credits calculated pursuant to paragraph two
  of this subsection with regard to each entity in which such taxpayer has
  a direct ownership interest.
    (4) If the amount of the credit allowable pursuant to this  subsection
  for  any taxable year exceeds the tax due for such year pursuant to this
  article, the excess amount shall be treated as  an  overpayment,  to  be
  credited or refunded, without interest.
    (5)  Limitation  on  credit.  No credit shall be allowed to a taxpayer
  under this subsection unless the electing city partnership  or  electing
  city  resident S corporation provided sufficient information to identify
  such taxpayer on its city pass-through entity  tax  return  as  required
  under   paragraph  two  of  subsection  (c)  of  section  eight  hundred
  seventy-two  of  this  chapter  for  an  electing  city  partnership  or
  paragraph  two of subsection (d) of section eight hundred seventy-two of
  this chapter for an electing city resident  S  corporation.  The  credit
  allowed  to a taxpayer under this subsection shall not exceed the direct
  share of city pass-through entity tax reported  by  such  electing  city


 partnership or electing city resident S corporation attributable to such
  taxpayer  on  such electing city partnership or electing city resident S
  corporation's return filed pursuant to section eight hundred seventy-two
  of this chapter. 
   §  1311.  Enforcement with other taxes. (a) If there is assessed a tax
  under a city income tax  imposed  pursuant  to  the  authority  of  this
  article  and  there  is  also  assessed  a tax or taxes against the same
  taxpayer pursuant to  article  twenty-two  or  articles  twenty-two  and
  twenty-three  of  this  chapter or under a local law enacted pursuant to
  the authority of article two-E of the general city law and payment of  a
  single  amount  is  required  under the provisions of this article, such
  payment shall be deemed to have been made with respect to the  taxes  so
  assessed  in proportion to the amounts of such taxes due, including tax,
  penalties, interest and additions to tax.
    (b) If the state  tax  commission  takes  action  under  such  article
  twenty-two  or articles twenty-two and twenty-three or under a local law
  enacted pursuant to the authority of article two-E of the  general  city
  law  with  respect to the enforcement and collection of the tax or taxes
  assessed under such articles the state tax  commission  shall,  wherever
  possible,  accompany  such  action  with  a similar action under similar
  enforcement and collection provisions of such city income tax.
    (c) Any moneys collected as a result of such  joint  action  shall  be
  deemed  to  have  been  collected  in  proportion  to  the  amounts due,
  including tax, penalties, interest and additions to tax,  under  article
  twenty-two  or  articles twenty-two and twenty-three of this chapter and
  such city income tax.
    (d) Whenever the state tax commission takes any action with respect to
  a  deficiency  of  income  tax  under  article  twenty-two  or  articles
  twenty-two and twenty-three of this chapter or under a local law enacted
  pursuant  to  the  authority  of  article two-E of the general city law,
  other than the action set forth in subdivision (a) of this  section,  it
  may  in its discretion accompany such action with a similar action under
  such city income tax.




   § 1312. Administration, collection and review. (a) Except as otherwise
  provided  in  this article, any tax imposed pursuant to the authority of
  this article shall be administered and collected by the commissioner  in
  the same manner as the tax imposed by article twenty-two of this chapter
  is administered and collected by the commissioner. All of the provisions
  of  article  twenty-two  of  this  chapter  relating to or applicable to
  payment of estimated tax,  returns,  payment  of  tax,  claim  of  right
  adjustment,  withholding  of  tax  from wages, employer's statements and
  returns, employer's liability for taxes required to be withheld and  all
  other  provisions  of  article twenty-two of this chapter relating to or
  applicable to the administration, collection, liability for  and  review
  of  the  tax  imposed  by  article twenty-two of this chapter, including
  sections six hundred fifty-two through six hundred fifty-four,  sections
  six  hundred  fifty-seven  through  six hundred fifty-nine, sections six
  hundred sixty-one  and  six  hundred  sixty-two,  sections  six  hundred
  seventy-one   and   six   hundred   seventy-two,  sections  six  hundred
  seventy-four through six hundred seventy-eight and sections six  hundred
  eighty-one  through six hundred ninety-seven of this chapter, inclusive,
  shall apply to a tax imposed pursuant to the authority of  this  article
  with  the  same  force  and  effect  as  if  those  provisions  had been
  incorporated in full into this article, and had  expressly  referred  to
  the  tax imposed pursuant to the authority of this article, except where
  inconsistent with a provision of this article. Whenever there  is  joint
  collection  of  state and city personal income taxes, it shall be deemed
  that such collections shall  represent  proportionately  the  applicable
  state  and  city  personal  income taxes in determining the amount to be
  remitted to the city.
    (b) The state tax commission, in its discretion, may require or permit
  any or all persons liable for any tax imposed pursuant to the  authority
  of this article to make payments on account of estimated tax and payment
  of  any tax, penalty or interest to such banks, banking housing or trust
  companies designated by the state tax commission  and  to  file  returns
  with  such  banks,  banking  houses  or trust companies, as agent of the
  state tax commission, in lieu of paying a tax imposed  pursuant  to  the
  authority of this article directly to the state tax commission. However,
  the state tax commission shall designate only such banks, banking houses
  or   trust   companies  which  are  designated  by  the  comptroller  as
  depositories of the state.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions  of  this  article,  any  law
  imposing  a  tax pursuant to the authority of this article shall provide
  that the state tax commission may require:
    (1) the filing of any or all of the following:
    (A) a combined return which, in addition to the return provided for in
  section thirteen hundred six, may  also  include  any  or  both  of  the
  returns  required to be filed by a resident individual of New York state
  pursuant to the provisions of section  six  hundred  fifty-one  of  this
  chapter  and  which  may  be  required  to  be  filed by such individual
  pursuant to any local law enacted pursuant to the authority  of  section
  twenty-five-m of the general city law, and
    (B)  a combined employer's return which, in addition to the employer's
  return provided for by any law enacted pursuant to the authority of this
  article, may also include any or both of the employer's returns required
  to be filed by the same employer pursuant to the provisions  of  section
  six  hundred  seventy-four  of  this chapter and required to be filed by
  such employer pursuant to any local law enacted under the  authority  of
  section twenty-five-m of the general city law, and
    (C)   a   combined  partnership  return  which,  in  addition  to  the
  partnership return provided for by  any  law  enacted  pursuant  to  the


 authority  of  this  article,  may  also  include  either or both of the
  partnership returns required to be filed by a  partnership  pursuant  to
  the provisions of paragraph one of subsection (c) of section six hundred
  fifty-eight of this chapter and required to be filed by such partnership
  pursuant  to  any  local  law  enacted  under  the  authority of section
  twenty-five-m of the general city law, and
    (2) where a combined return or employer's return is required, and with
  respect to the payment of estimated tax, the state  tax  commission  may
  also  require the payment to it of a single amount which shall equal the
  total of the amounts (total taxes less any  credits  or  refunds)  which
  would  have  been  required  to  be  paid with the returns or employer's
  returns or in payment of estimated tax pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
  article  twenty-two  of  the  tax  law, and the provisions of local laws
  enacted under the authority of this article and section twenty-five-m of
  the general city law.




   § 1313. Deposit and disposition of revenues. (a) All revenue collected
  by  the commissioner from the taxes imposed pursuant to the authority of
  this article or former article two-E of the general city  law  shall  be
  deposited  daily  with  such  responsible banks, banking houses or trust
  companies, as may be designated by the state comptroller, to the  credit
  of  the  comptroller,  in trust for the city of New York or the New York
  city transitional finance  authority,  as  their  interests  may  appear
  pursuant  to  this  section.  Such  deposits  shall be kept in trust and
  separate and apart from all  other  moneys  in  the  possession  of  the
  comptroller.  The  comptroller  shall require adequate security from all
  such depositories of such revenue collected by the commissioner.
    (b) The comptroller shall  retain  in  the  comptroller's  hands  such
  amount  as the commissioner may determine to be necessary for refunds in
  respect to the taxes imposed pursuant to the authority of  this  article
  or former article two-E of the general city law and for reasonable costs
  of  the  commissioner in administering, collecting and distributing such
  taxes and the tax imposed pursuant  to  article  twenty-four-B  of  this
  chapter,  out  of  which  the  comptroller shall pay any refunds of such
  taxes to which  taxpayers  shall  be  entitled  under  any  law  enacted
  pursuant to the authority of this article or former article two-E of the
  general city law.
    (c)  Subject  to the provisions of subsection (g) of this section, the
  comptroller, after reserving such refund  fund  and  such  costs  shall,
  commencing  on or before the fifteenth day of each month, pay to the New
  York city transitional finance authority on a daily basis the balance of
  taxes imposed pursuant to  the  authority  of  this  article  or  former
  article two-E of the general city law to be applied by the authority, in
  the  following  order  of  priority:  first  pursuant to the authority's
  contracts with  bondholders,  then  to  pay  the  authority's  operating
  expenses   not   otherwise  provided  for,  and  then  pursuant  to  the
  authority's agreements with the city, which agreements shall require the
  authority to transfer the balance of such taxes  not  required  to  meet
  contractual  or  other  obligations  of  the  authority  to  the city as
  frequently as practicable; except that the comptroller shall:
    (1) pay to the state department of  social  services  that  amount  of
  overpayments  of  the  taxes  imposed  pursuant to the authority of this
  article or former article two-E of the general city law and the interest
  on such amount which is certified to the comptroller by the commissioner
  as the amount to  be  credited  against  past-due  support  pursuant  to
  subdivision six of section one hundred seventy-one-c of this chapter;
    (2)  pay  to  the New York state higher education services corporation
  that amount of  overpayments  of  the  taxes  imposed  pursuant  to  the
  authority  of  this  article or former article two-E of the general city
  law  and  the  interest  on  such  amount  which  is  certified  to  the
  comptroller by the commissioner as the amount to be credited against the
  amount  of defaults in repayment of guaranteed student loans pursuant to
  subdivision five of section one hundred seventy-one-d of this chapter;
    (3) pay to the state university of New York or the city university  of
  New  York  respectively that amount of overpayments of the taxes imposed
  pursuant to the authority of this article or former article two-E of the
  general city law and the interest on such amount which is  certified  to
  the comptroller by the commissioner as the amount to be credited against
  the  amount  of  defaults in repayment of state or city university loans
  pursuant to subdivision six of section one hundred seventy-one-e of this
  chapter;
    (4) notwithstanding any  provision  of  law,  credit  to  the  revenue
  arrearage account, pursuant to section ninety-one-a of the state finance
  law,  that  amount  of overpayments of the taxes imposed pursuant to the


 authority of this article or former article two-E of  the  general  city
  law  and  the  interest  on  such  amount  which  is  certified  to  the
  comptroller by the commissioner as the amount to be credited  against  a
  past-due  legally  enforceable  debt  owed to a state agency pursuant to
  paragraph (a) of subdivision six of section one hundred seventy-one-f of
  this chapter, provided, however, the comptroller  shall  credit  to  the
  special  offset  fiduciary  account, pursuant to section ninety-one-c of
  the state finance law, any such amount creditable as a liability as  set
  forth  in  paragraph  (b)  of  subdivision  six  of  section one hundred
  seventy-one-f of this chapter;
    (5) pay to the city of New York that amount  of  overpayments  of  tax
  imposed  pursuant  to  the authority of this article and the interest on
  such amount which is certified to the comptroller by the commissioner as
  the amount to be credited against city of New York tax warrant  judgment
  debt pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-l of this chapter; and
    (6)  pay  to  a non-obligated spouse that amount of overpayment of tax
  imposed pursuant to the authority of  this  article  or  former  article
  two-E  of the general city law and the interest on such amount which has
  been credited pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-c, one hundred
  seventy-one-d, one hundred seventy-one-e, one hundred  seventy-one-f  or
  one  hundred seventy-one-l of this chapter and which is certified to the
  comptroller by the commissioner as the  amount  due  such  non-obligated
  spouse  pursuant  to  paragraph  six  of  subsection  (b) of section six
  hundred fifty-one of this chapter, and the comptroller  shall  deduct  a
  like  amount  which,  the comptroller shall pay into the treasury to the
  credit of the general fund, from amounts  subsequently  payable  to  the
  office  of  temporary and disability assistance, the state university of
  New York, the city university of New York, the higher education services
  corporation,  or  the  revenue  arrearage  account  or  special   offset
  fiduciary  account  pursuant  to section ninety-one-a or ninety-one-c of
  the state finance law, as the case may be, whichever had  been  credited
  the amount originally withheld from such overpayment.
    (d)  The  amount  deducted  under  subsection  (b) of this section for
  administering,  collecting  and  distributing  such  taxes  during  such
  monthly period shall be paid by the comptroller into the general fund of
  the state treasury to the credit of the state purposes account therein.
    (e) The first payment to such chief fiscal officer shall be made on or
  before  March  fifteenth,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-six, which payment
  shall represent the balance of revenue after provision  for  refund  and
  such  reasonable  costs,  with  respect  to taxes collected from January
  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-six  through  February  twenty-ninth,
  nineteen  hundred  seventy-six.  Subsequent payments shall be made on or
  before April fifteenth, nineteen hundred seventy-six, and on  or  before
  the  fifteenth  day  of  each  succeeding  month  thereafter,  and shall
  represent the balance of revenue with respect  to  taxes  collected  the
  preceding calendar months.
    (f)  The  amounts  so payable under this section shall be certified to
  the comptroller by the  commissioner  or  the  commissioner's  delegate,
  either  of  whom  shall  not  be  held liable for any inaccuracy in such
  certificate.  Where the amount so paid over to such chief fiscal officer
  is more or less than the amount  then  due  such  city,  the  amount  of
  overpayment or underpayment shall be certified to the comptroller by the
  commissioner or the commissioner's delegate, either of whom shall not be
  held  liable  for  any  inaccuracy  in  such  certificate. The amount of
  overpayment or underpayment shall be so certified to the comptroller  as
  soon   after  the  discovery  of  the  overpayment  or  underpayment  as
  reasonably possible and subsequent payments by the comptroller  to  such
  chief  fiscal officer shall be adjusted by subtracting the amount of any


 such overpayment from, or by adding the amount of any such  underpayment
  to   such  number  of  subsequent  payments  and  distributions  as  the
  comptroller and the commissioner shall consider reasonable  in  view  of
  the  amount  of  the overpayment or underpayment and all other facts and
  circumstances.
    (g) The balance payable to the  New  York  city  transitional  finance
  authority  pursuant  to  this section shall instead be paid to the chief
  fiscal officer of the city of New York unless and until the  comptroller
  has received from such authority a notice, which shall be conclusive and
  upon  which  the comptroller may rely without further inquiry, that such
  authority has incurred obligations payable by it, whether  for  borrowed
  money,  operating  expenses  or otherwise. On and after the date of such
  notice and until such date as the authority shall  have  no  obligations
  outstanding,  the  city  shall have no right, title or interest in or to
  the taxes, except as provided in the  authority's  agreements  with  the
  city.
    (h)  Notwithstanding any provision of state or local law, ordinance or
  resolution to  the  contrary,  if  the  commissioner  of  health  timely
  certifies  to  the  commissioner  that a city having a population of one
  million or more which imposes tax pursuant  to  the  authority  of  this
  article  properly  exercised  its  option pursuant to section two of the
  chapter of the laws of two thousand five which  added  this  subdivision
  that  such  city  be  reimbursed  for medical assistance expenditures as
  provided in such section two of such  chapter,  the  commissioner  shall
  make  and  certify  the  calculations  and the comptroller shall, on the
  fifteenth day of each month, starting in January,  two  thousand  eight,
  intercept  and pay monthly amounts of revenue from taxes imposed in such
  a city pursuant to  the  authority  of  this  article,  as  provided  in
  subdivision (g) of section twelve hundred sixty-one of this chapter.






	   §  1320.  Short title. This article shall be known and may be cited as
  the "city income tax surcharge act".




   §  1321.  Authority to impose city income tax surcharge.  (a) General.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, but  subject
  to the limitations and conditions set forth in this article, any city in
  this  state having a population of more than one hundred eighty thousand
  but less than two hundred fifteen thousand inhabitants,  acting  through
  its  local legislative body, is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt
  and amend local laws imposing  in  any  such  city,  for  taxable  years
  beginning  after  nineteen  hundred eighty-three and before two thousand
  twenty-six, a city income tax surcharge on residents of such city  at  a
  rate not to exceed nineteen and one-quarter percent of the net state tax
  as  defined  in  section  thirteen hundred twenty-three of this article,
  such city  income  tax  surcharge  to  be  administered,  collected  and
  distributed by the commissioner as provided for in this article.
    (b)  Earnings  tax  on  nonresidents  requirement. The city income tax
  surcharge authorized by this article may be imposed only if this chapter
  authorizes the adoption of a city tax on the  earnings  of  nonresidents
  and  the  city  imposing the tax authorized by this article also imposes
  such tax on the earnings of nonresidents.
    (c) Effectiveness of local law and filing  with  commissioner.  (i)  A
  local  law  enacted  pursuant  to the authority of this section shall go
  into effect on the first day of January,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-four
  and  shall  apply  to  taxable years beginning on or after such date and
  before two thousand twenty-six. Provided, however,  no  such  local  law
  shall  be  so  effective  unless  such  local  law  is  enacted  by July
  thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-four and unless a  certified  copy
  of  such  local  law  is  mailed  by registered or certified mail to the
  commissioner at the commissioner's office in Albany by such  date.  (ii)
  If  the  requirements of paragraph (i) of this subsection are not met, a
  local law enacted pursuant to the authority of  this  section  shall  go
  into  effect  on  the first day of the next succeeding January and shall
  apply to taxable years beginning on or after such date  and  before  two
  thousand  twenty-six.  Provided,  however, no such local law shall be so
  effective unless such local law is enacted at least ninety days prior to
  the date it is to become effective and unless a certified copy  of  such
  local  law is mailed by registered or certified mail to the commissioner
  at such commissioner's office in  Albany  by  such  date.  However,  the
  commissioner  may  waive and reduce such ninety day minimum requirements
  within a period of not less than thirty days  prior  to  such  effective
  date  if  such commissioner deems such action to be consistent with such
  commissioner's duties under this article. (iii) Any amendment of such  a
  local  law  enacted  pursuant  to  the  authority of this section, which
  changes the rate of the income tax surcharge on  residents,  shall  take
  effect  on  the first day of January in the year in which such amendment
  is enacted and shall apply to taxable years beginning on or  after  such
  date, if such amendment is enacted on or before July thirty-first of the
  year  in  which  it  is  to  take  effect  and  a certified copy of such
  amendment is mailed by registered or certified mail to the  commissioner
  at his or her office in Albany by such date. (iv) If the requirements of
  paragraph  (iii)  of  this subsection are not met, the amendment of such
  local law shall go into effect on the first day of the  next  succeeding
  January  and  shall  apply  to  taxable years beginning on or after such
  date, provided that no such amendment shall take  effect  unless  it  is
  enacted at least ninety days prior to the date it is to become effective
  and  a  certified copy thereof is mailed by registered or certified mail
  to the commissioner at his or her office in Albany by such date. (v) Any
  amendment to the provisions of article twenty-two of this chapter to the
  extent that  such  amendment  is  applicable  to  the  city  income  tax


 surcharge  imposed  under  such  local law, shall be deemed to have been
  incorporated in the analogous provision or provisions of such local law.
    (d)  Filing  of  local law with others. Certified copies of such local
  law shall also be filed with the clerk of the city wherein  the  tax  is
  imposed,  the secretary of state and the state comptroller within thirty
  days of the date of enactment.

  than  thirty  days of the taxable year in the city, or (B)(i) within any
  period of five hundred forty-eight consecutive days  the  taxpayer,  the
  taxpayer's  spouse  (unless  the  spouse  is  legally separated) and the
  taxpayer's minor children are present in a foreign country or  countries
  for at least four hundred fifty days, and (ii) during the period of five
  hundred  forty-eight consecutive days the taxpayer is not present in the
  city for more than ninety days, and (iii) during any period of less than
  twelve months, which would be  treated  as  a  separate  taxable  period
  pursuant  to  section thirteen hundred twenty-seven of this article, and
  which period is contained within the period of five hundred  forty-eight
  consecutive  days,  the  taxpayer is present in the city for a number of
  days which does not exceed an amount  which  bears  the  same  ratio  to
  ninety  as  the  number  of  days  contained in that period of less than
  twelve months bears to five hundred forty-eight, or
    (2) who is not domiciled in such city but maintains a permanent  place
  of  abode in such city and spends in the aggregate more than one hundred

    (B) a person domiciled in such city at the time such trust or  portion
  of  a  trust  became irrevocable, if it was revocable when such property
  was transferred to the trust but has subsequently become irrevocable.
    For the purposes of the foregoing, a trust or a portion of a trust  is
  revocable if it is subject to a power, exercisable immediately or at any
  future  time,  to  revest title in the person whose property constitutes
  such trust or portion of a trust and a  trust  or  portion  of  a  trust
  becomes  irrevocable  when  the  possibility  that  such  power  may  be
  exercised has been terminated.

  liabilities of husband and wife  are  determined  on  separate  returns,
  their  city  income  tax  surcharge  liabilities  and  returns  shall be
  separate.
    (2) If the New York state personal income tax liabilities  of  husband
  and  wife (other than a husband and wife described in paragraph three of
  this subsection) are determined on a joint return,  they  shall  file  a
  joint  city  income  tax  surcharge  return,  and  their city income tax
  surcharge liabilities shall be joint and several except as  provided  in
  paragraph  five  of  this subsection, section six hundred fifty-four and
  subsection (e) of section six hundred eighty-five of this chapter.
    (3) If either husband or wife is a city resident and the  other  is  a
  city   nonresident,  and  their  New  York  state  personal  income  tax
  liabilities are determined on a joint return:
    (A) they may elect to file a joint city income tax surcharge return as
  if both were residents, in which case their city  income  tax  surcharge
  liabilities  shall  be joint and several except as provided in paragraph

    (5) If a joint return has been made pursuant to this subsection for  a
  taxable  year  and  only one spouse is liable for past-due support, or a
  past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of  New  York  tax  warrant
  judgment  debt,  or  an amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed
  student,  state  university  or  city  university  loan  of  which   the
  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  has  been notified pursuant to
  section  one  hundred  seventy-one-c,  one  hundred  seventy-one-d,  one
  hundred   seventy-one-e,   one  hundred  seventy-one-f  or  one  hundred
  seventy-one-l of this chapter, as the case may be, then  an  overpayment
  and interest thereon shall be credited against such past-due support, or
  a  past-due  legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax warrant
  judgment debt, or such amount of a default in repayment of a  guaranteed
  student, state university or city university loan, unless the spouse not
  liable  for  such  past-due  support,  or a past-due legally enforceable
  debt, or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or such amount of
  a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city
  university loan demands,  on  a  declaration  made  in  accordance  with
  regulations  or  instructions prescribed by the commissioner of taxation
  and  finance,  that  the  portion  of  the  overpayment   and   interest
  attributable  to  such  spouse  not  be  credited  against  the past-due
  support, or a past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of  New  York
  tax  warrant  judgment  debt,  or  amount of a default in repayment of a
  guaranteed student, state university or city university loan owed by the
  other spouse. Upon such demand the commissioner of taxation and  finance
  shall  determine  the  amount  of  the  overpayment attributable to each
  spouse in accordance with regulations prescribed by the commissioner  of
  taxation and finance and credit only that portion of the overpayment and
  interest thereon attributable to the spouse liable for past-due support,


 or  a  past-due  legally  enforceable  debt,  or  a city of New York tax
  warrant judgment debt,  or  amount  of  a  default  in  repayment  of  a
  guaranteed  student,  state  university  or city university loan against
  such past-due support, or a past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city
  of  New  York  tax warrant judgment debt, or such amount of a default in
  repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or  city  university
  loan.
    (6)  The  commissioner  shall  clearly alert married taxpayers, on all
  appropriate publications and instructions, that their liability for  tax
  will  be  joint  and  several if they file joint income tax returns. The
  commissioner shall include notice of an  individual's  right  to  relief
  from  joint  and  several  liability  pursuant  to  section  six hundred
  fifty-four of  this  chapter  in  the  disclosure  of  rights  statement
  required  by  section  three  thousand  four  of this chapter and in any
  notice regarding collection of tax due with respect to a liability on  a
  joint return.
    (c)  Decedents.  The  return for any deceased individual shall be made
  and filed by his executor, administrator, or other person  charged  with
  his  property.  If a final return of a decedent is for a fractional part

  fourth month following the close of the twelve-month period which  began
  with the first day of such fractional part of the year.
    (d)  Individuals  under a disability. The return for an individual who
  is unable to make a return by reason of  minority  or  other  disability
  shall  be  made and filed by his guardian, committee, fiduciary or other

  receiver  in  possession of only a part of his property), or by his duly
  authorized agent.
    (e) Estates and trusts. The return for an estate  or  trust  shall  be
  made and filed by the fiduciary.

   §  1327.  Change  of  resident  status during year. (a) General. If an
  individual changes his status during his taxable year from city resident
  to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city resident, he shall
  file one return as a city resident for the portion of  the  year  during
  which  he  is a city resident, and a return under a local law authorized
  by article thirty-B of this chapter for the portion of the  year  during
  which  he is a city nonresident, subject to such exceptions as the state
  tax commission may prescribe by regulation.
    (b) Trusts. If the status of a trust changes during its  taxable  year
  from city resident to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city
  resident,  the  fiduciary shall file one return as a city resident trust
  for the portion of the year during which the trust is  a  city  resident
  trust,  and a return under a local law authorized by article thirty-B of
  this chapter for the portion of the year during which  the  trust  is  a
  city  nonresident  trust,  subject  to  such exceptions as the state tax
  commission may prescribe by regulations.
    (c) Computation of net state tax. When an individual or trust  changes
  resident  status during the taxable year, the net state tax shall be the
  net state tax determined as if such individual or  trust  were  a  state
  resident  for  the  entire  taxable  year,  multiplied by a fraction the
  numerator of which is such individual's or  trust's  New  York  adjusted
  gross  income  for  the  period of residence, computed as if the taxable
  year for federal tax purposes were limited to the period  of  residence,
  and  the  denominator  of which is such individual's or trust's New York
  adjusted gross income for the entire taxable year. For purposes  of  the
  preceding  sentence,  New  York  adjusted  gross  income  means New York
  adjusted gross  income  determined  under  article  twenty-two  of  this
  chapter.




   §  1329. Requirement of withholding tax from wages.  (a) A city income
  tax surcharge imposed pursuant to the authority of  this  article  shall
  provide that such tax shall be withheld from the wages of city residents
  in the same manner and subject to the same requirements, to the greatest
  extent possible, as provided in sections six hundred seventy-one through
  six   hundred  seventy-eight  of  this  chapter  except  that  the  term
  "aggregate amount"  contained  in  paragraphs  one,  two  and  three  of

  local  law  enacted in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (i)
  of subsection  (c)  of  section  thirteen  hundred  twenty-one  of  this
  article, not later than January first, nineteen hundred eighty-five, and
  (ii)  in  the  case  of  a  local  law  enacted  in  accordance with the
  requirements of paragraph (ii) of such subsection, not  later  than  the
  effective  date  of  such  local  law  or  ninety days after the date of
  enactment of such local law, whichever is later.




   §  1330.  Credit  for  tax  withheld.  The  city  income tax surcharge
  withheld shall not reduce net state tax for purposes  of  computing  the
  city  income  tax surcharge, but any amount of tax actually deducted and
  withheld under the authority of this article in any calendar year  shall
  be deemed to have been paid to the state tax commission on behalf of the
  person from whom withheld, and such person shall be credited with having
  paid  the  amount of tax for the taxable year beginning in such calendar
  year. For a taxable year of less than twelve months, the credit shall be
  made under regulations of the state tax commission.




   §  1331.  Enforcement with other taxes. (a) Joint assessment. If there
  is assessed a tax under a city income tax surcharge imposed pursuant  to
  the  authority  of this article and there is also assessed a tax against
  the same taxpayer pursuant to article  twenty-two  of  this  chapter  or
  under a local law enacted pursuant to the authority of article thirty or
  thirty-B  of  this  chapter or article two-E of the general city law and
  payment of a single amount is required  under  the  provisions  of  this
  article,  such payment shall be deemed to have been made with respect to
  the taxes so assessed in proportion to the amounts of  such  taxes  due,
  including tax, penalties, interest and additions to tax.
    (b)  Joint action. If the state tax commission takes action under such
  article twenty-two  or  under  a  local  law  enacted  pursuant  to  the
  authority of article thirty or thirty-B of this chapter or article two-E
  of  the  general city law with respect to the enforcement and collection
  of the  tax  or  taxes  assessed  under  such  articles  the  state  tax
  commission  shall,  wherever  possible,  accompany  such  action  with a
  similar action under similar enforcement and  collection  provisions  of
  such city income tax surcharge.
    (c)  Apportionment  of  moneys  collected  by joint action. Any moneys
  collected as a result of such joint action shall be deemed to have  been
  collected  in  proportion  to the amounts due, including tax, penalties,
  interest and additions to tax, under article twenty-two of this  chapter
  or under a local law enacted pursuant to the authority of article thirty

  otherwise provided in  this  article,  any  city  income  tax  surcharge

  fifty-nine,  sections  six  hundred sixty-one and six hundred sixty-two,
  sections six hundred seventy-one and six hundred  seventy-two,  sections
  six  hundred seventy-four through six hundred seventy-eight and sections
  six hundred eighty-one through six hundred ninety-seven of this chapter,
  inclusive, shall apply to a city income tax surcharge  imposed  pursuant
  to  the  authority  of this article with the same force and effect as if
  those provisions had been incorporated in full into  this  article,  and
  had expressly referred to the city income tax surcharge imposed pursuant
  to  the  authority  of  this  article,  except where inconsistent with a
  provision of this article. Whenever there is joint collection  of  state
  personal income tax, city personal income tax, city income tax surcharge
  or  city  nonresident  earnings  taxes,  it  shall  be  deemed that such
  collection shall represent proportionately the applicable state personal
  income tax, city personal income tax, city income tax surcharge or  city
  nonresident  earnings  taxes in determining the amount to be remitted to
  the city.
    (b) Payment to designated depositories. The state tax  commission,  in
  its  discretion, may require or permit any or all persons liable for any
  city income tax surcharge imposed pursuant  to  the  authority  of  this
  article  to  make  payments  on  account  of  estimated  city income tax
  surcharge and payment of any  city  income  tax  surcharge,  penalty  or
  interest  of such banks, banking houses or trust companies designated by
  the state tax commission and to file returns with  such  banks,  banking
  houses or trust companies, as agent of the state tax commission, in lieu
  of  paying a city income tax surcharge imposed pursuant to the authority
  of this article directly to the state tax commission. However, the state
  tax commission shall designate only such banks, banking houses or  trust
  companies which are designated by the comptroller as depositories of the
  state.
    (c)  Combined  filings.  Notwithstanding  any other provisions of this
  article, any law imposing a city income tax surcharge  pursuant  to  the
  authority  of  this  article shall provide that the state tax commission
  may require:
    (1) the filing of any or all of the following:
    (A) a combined return which, in addition to the return provided for in
  section thirteen hundred twenty-six, may also include any of the returns
  required to be filed by a resident individual of New York state pursuant
  to the provisions of section six hundred fifty-one of this  chapter  and
  which  may  be  required  to be filed by such individual pursuant to any
  local law enacted  pursuant  to  the  authority  of  article  thirty  or
  thirty-B of this chapter or article two-E of the general city law, and
    (B)  a combined employer's return which, in addition to the employer's
  return provided for by any law enacted pursuant to the authority of this
  article, may also include any of the employer's returns required  to  be


 filed  by  the  same  employer pursuant to the provisions of section six
  hundred seventy-four of this chapter and required to be  filed  by  such
  employer  pursuant  to  any  local  law  enacted  under the authority of
  article  thirty  or  thirty-B  of  this  chapter or article two-E of the
  general city law, and
    (2) where a combined return or employer's return is required, and with
  respect to the payment of estimated tax, the state  tax  commission  may
  also  require the payment to it of a single amount which shall equal the
  total of the amounts (total taxes less any  credits  or  refunds)  which
  would  have  been  required  to  be  paid with the returns or employer's
  returns or in payment of estimated tax pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
  article  twenty-two  of  this  chapter, and the provisions of local laws
  enacted under the  authority  of  this  article  or  article  thirty  or
  thirty-B of this chapter or article two-E of the general city law.
    (d)  Liability  for  failure to pay estimated tax. For the tax year in
  which such local law is  enacted,  no  addition  to  the  tax  shall  be
  imposed,  pursuant  to subsection (c) of section six hundred eighty-five
  of this chapter, through the operation of the provisions of this section
  for the portion of the underpayment of estimated tax as the result of  a
  local  law  enacted  pursuant  to  paragraph  (iii) of subsection (c) of
  section thirteen hundred twenty-one of this article.




   §  1333. Deposit and disposition of revenues. All revenue collected by
  the commissioner of taxation and finance from the  tax  imposed  by  any
  city  pursuant  to  the authority of this article or article thirty-B of
  this chapter shall be  deposited  daily  with  such  responsible  banks,
  banking  houses  or  trust  companies, as may be designated by the state
  comptroller, to the credit of the comptroller, in trust for  such  city.
  Such  deposits  shall  be  kept in trust and separate and apart from all
  other moneys in the possession of the comptroller. The comptroller shall
  require adequate security from all such  depositories  of  such  revenue
  collected  by  the commissioner of taxation and finance. The comptroller
  shall retain in his hands such amount as the  commissioner  of  taxation
  and  finance may determine to be necessary for refunds in respect to the

  article  thirty-B  of  this  chapter  and  for  reasonable  costs of the
  commissioner of taxation and finance in  administering,  collecting  and
  distributing  such  taxes,  out  of  which the comptroller shall pay any
  refunds of such taxes to which the taxpayer shall be entitled under  any
  law  enacted  by  such city pursuant to the authority of this article or
  article thirty-B of this chapter. The comptroller, after reserving  such
  refund  fund and such cost shall, on or before the fifteenth day of each
  month, pay to the chief fiscal officer of such city the balance of  such
  taxes collected, to be paid into the treasury of such city to the credit
  of  the general fund except that he shall pay to the state department of
  social services that amount of overpayments of the tax imposed  by  such
  city  pursuant  to  the authority of this article or article thirty-B of
  this chapter and the interest on such amount which is certified  to  him
  by the commissioner of taxation and finance as the amount to be credited
  against  past-due  support  pursuant  to  subdivision six of section one
  hundred seventy-one-c of this chapter and except that he  shall  pay  to
  the  New York state higher education services corporation that amount of

  such amount which is certified to him by the  commissioner  of  taxation
  and  finance as the amount to be credited against the amount of defaults
  in repayment of guaranteed student loans pursuant to subdivision five of
  section one hundred seventy-one-d of this chapter  and  except  that  he
  shall  pay to the state university of New York or the city university of
  New York respectively that amount of overpayments of the tax imposed  by
  such  city pursuant to the authority of this article or article thirty-B
  of this chapter and the interest on such amount which  is  certified  to
  him  by  the  commissioner  of  taxation and finance as the amount to be
  credited against the amount of defaults in repayment of  state  or  city
  university  loans  pursuant  to  subdivision  six of section one hundred
  seventy-one-e of this chapter and except that, notwithstanding any other
  provision of law, he shall credit  to  the  revenue  arrearage  account,
  pursuant  to  section ninety-one-a of the state finance law, that amount
  of overpayments of the taxes imposed pursuant to the authority  of  this
  article  or  article  thirty-B  of this chapter and the interest on such
  amount which is certified to him by the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance  as  the  amount  to  be  credited  against  a  past-due legally
  enforceable debt owed to a state agency pursuant  to  paragraph  (a)  of
  subdivision  six  of  section one hundred seventy-one-f of this chapter,
  provided, however, he shall  credit  to  the  special  offset  fiduciary
  account,  pursuant to section ninety-one-c of the state finance law, any
  such amount creditable as a liability as set forth in paragraph  (b)  of
  subdivision six of section one hundred seventy-one-f of this chapter and
  except  that  he  shall  pay  to  the  city  of  New York that amount of
  overpayments of tax imposed pursuant to the authority of this article or


 article thirty-B of this chapter and the interest on such  amount  which
  is  certified  to him by the commissioner of taxation and finance as the
  amount to be credited against city of New York tax warrant judgment debt
  pursuant  to  section  one  hundred  seventy-one-l  of this chapter, and
  except further that he/she shall pay  to  a  non-obligated  spouse  that
  amount  of  overpayment  of  tax  imposed  by  such city pursuant to the
  authority of this article or article thirty-B of this  chapter  and  the
  interest  on such amount which has been credited pursuant to section one
  hundred  seventy-one-c,   one   hundred   seventy-one-d,   one   hundred
  seventy-one-e, one hundred seventy-one-f or one hundred seventy-one-l of

  taxation and  finance  as  the  amount  due  such  non-obligated  spouse

  fifty-one of this chapter, and he shall deduct a like  amount  which  he
  shall  pay  into  the  treasury  to  the credit of the general fund from
  amounts subsequently payable to the department of social  services,  the
  state  university  of  New York, the city university of New York, or the

  account   or  special  offset  fiduciary  account  pursuant  to  section
  ninety-one-a or ninety-one-c of the state finance law, as the  case  may
  be, whichever had been credited the amount originally withheld from such
  overpayment.  The  amount  deducted  for  administering,  collecting and
  distributing such taxes during such monthly period shall be paid by  the
  comptroller into the general fund of the state treasury to the credit of
  the  state  purposes  account  therein.  The first payment to such chief
  fiscal officer shall be made on  or  before  March  fifteenth,  nineteen
  hundred  eighty-five,  which  payment  shall  represent  the  balance of
  revenue after provision for  refund  and  such  reasonable  costs,  with
  respect  to  taxes collected in nineteen hundred eighty-four. Subsequent
  payments shall be made on or before April  fifteenth,  nineteen  hundred
  eighty-five, and on or before the fifteenth day of each succeeding month
  thereafter,  and  shall represent the balance of revenue with respect to
  taxes collected the preceding calendar months. The  amounts  so  payable
  shall  be  certified  to the comptroller by the commissioner of taxation
  and finance or his delegate, either of whom shall not be held liable for
  any inaccuracy in such certificate. Where the amount  so  paid  over  to
  such  chief fiscal officer is more or less than the amount then due such
  city, the amount of overpayment or underpayment shall  be  certified  to
  the  comptroller  by  the  commissioner  of  taxation and finance or his
  delegate, either of whom shall not be held liable for any inaccuracy  in
  such  certificate. The amount of overpayment or underpayment shall be so
  certified to  the  comptroller  as  soon  after  the  discovery  of  the
  overpayment  or  underpayment  as  reasonably  possible  and  subsequent
  payments by the comptroller  to  such  chief  fiscal  officer  shall  be
  adjusted  by  subtracting the amount of any such overpayment from, or by
  adding the amount of any such underpayment to such number of  subsequent
  payments  and  distributions  as the comptroller and the commissioner of
  taxation and finance shall consider reasonable in view of the amount  of
  the overpayment or underpayment and all other facts and circumstances.

  tax  on  the earnings of nonresidents of such city to be administered in
  the manner provided for in this article by the commissioner.
    The tax authorized by this article may be imposed  only  if  the  city
  imposing  the  tax  herein  authorized  also  imposes  a city income tax
  surcharge on its residents. The rates of such tax  shall  be  the  rates
  contained in section two of the model local law.
    (b)  (i) A local law enacted pursuant to the authority of this section
  shall go into effect on the  first  day  of  January,  nineteen  hundred

  commissioner's office in Albany by such date. However, the  commissioner
  may  waive  and  reduce  such  ninety  day minimum requirements within a
  period of not less than thirty days prior to such effective date if such
  commissioner deems such action to be consistent with such commissioner's
  duties under this article. (iii) Any  amendment  of  such  a  local  law
  enacted pursuant to the authority of the section, which changes the rate
  of the income tax surcharge on residents, shall take effect on the first
  day  of January in the year in which such amendment is enacted and shall
  apply to taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after  such  date,  if  such
  amendment is enacted on or before July thirty-first of the year in which
  it is to take effect and a certified copy of such amendment is mailed by
  registered or certified mail to the commissioner at his or her office in
  Albany by such date. (iv) If the requirements of paragraph (iii) of this
  subsection  are  not  met, the amendment of such local law shall go into
  effect on the first day of the next succeeding January and  shall  apply

    (3) a trust, or a portion of a trust, consisting of the property of:
    (A) a person domiciled in such city at  the  time  such  property  was
  transferred  to  the trust, if such trust or portion of a trust was then
  irrevocable, or if it was then revocable and has not subsequently become
  irrevocable; or
    (B) a person domiciled in such city at the time such trust or  portion
  of  a  trust  became irrevocable, if it was revocable when such property
  was transferred to the trust but has subsequently become irrevocable.
    For the purposes of the foregoing, a trust or a portion of a trust  is
  revocable if it is subject to a power, exercisable immediately or at any


 future  time,  to  revest title in the person whose property constitutes
  such trust or portion of a trust and a  trust  or  portion  of  a  trust
  becomes  irrevocable  when  the  possibility  that  such  power  may  be
  exercised has been terminated.
    (i)  Nonresident  estate or trust. A nonresident estate or trust shall
  mean an estate or trust which is not a resident.
    (j) The term "partnership" shall include, unless a  different  meaning
  is  clearly required, a subchapter K limited liability company. The term
  "subchapter K limited liability company" shall mean a limited  liability
  company classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The
  term  "limited  liability  company"  means  a domestic limited liability
  company or a foreign limited liability company, as  defined  in  section
  one  hundred  two  of  the  limited  liability  company  law,  a limited
  liability investment company formed pursuant  to  section  five  hundred
  seven  of  the  banking law, or a limited liability trust company formed
  pursuant to section one hundred two-a of the banking law.
    (k) Comparable meaning of terms. Unless a different meaning is clearly
  required, any term used in this local law shall have the same meaning as
  when used in a comparable context in  the  laws  of  the  United  States
  relating  to  federal  taxes  but  such  meaning shall be subject to the
  exceptions  or  modifications  prescribed  in  or  pursuant  to  article
  thirty-B  of  the tax law or by the laws of this state. Any reference in
  this local law to the internal revenue code, the internal  revenue  code
  of nineteen hundred eighty-six or to the laws of the United States shall
  mean  the  provisions  of  the internal revenue code of nineteen hundred
  eighty-six (unless a reference to the internal revenue code of  nineteen
  hundred  fifty-four  is  clearly  intended), and amendments thereto, and
  other provisions of the laws of the United States  relating  to  federal
  taxes, and amendments thereto.
    §  2.  Persons  subject to tax. (a) Imposition of tax. A tax is hereby
  imposed at a rate not to exceed one-half of one  percent  on  the  wages
  earned, and net earnings from self-employment, within the city, of every
  nonresident individual, estate and trust.
    (b)  Exclusion.  (1) In computing the amount of wages and net earnings
  from self-employment taxable under subsection (a) of this section, there
  shall be allowed an  exclusion  against  the  total  of  wages  and  net
  earnings from self-employment in accordance with the following table:
      Total of Wages and Net Earnings
      From Self-Employment                         Exclusion Allowable
      Not Over $10,000                             $3,000
      Over $10,000 But Not Over
      $20,000                                      $2,000
      Over $20,000 But Not Over
      $30,000                                      $1,000
      Over $30,000                                 NONE
    (2)  The  exclusion  allowable shall be applied pro rata against wages
  and net earnings from self-employment.
    (3) For taxable periods of less than one year, the exclusion allowable
  shall be prorated pursuant to regulations of the state tax commission.
    (c) Limitation. In no event shall a taxpayer be  subject  to  the  tax
  under  this  local law in an amount greater than he would be required to
  pay if he were a resident of the city and subject to a city  income  tax
  surcharge  on  residents  of  the  city  adopted by the city pursuant to
  authority granted by article thirty-A of the tax law.
    § 3. Taxable years to which tax imposed by this local law applies. The
  tax imposed by this local law is imposed  for  taxable  years  beginning
  after  December  thirty-first,  nineteen hundred eighty-three and before
  January first, two thousand twenty-six.


   § 4. Allocation to  the  city.  (a)  General.  If  net  earnings  from
  self-employment  are  derived  from services performed, or from sources,
  within and without the city, there shall be allocated to the city a fair
  and equitable portion of such earnings.
    (b)  Allocation  of  net  earnings  from self-employment. (1) Place of
  business. If a taxpayer has no regular place  of  business  outside  the
  city  all of his net earnings from self-employment shall be allocated to
  the city.
    (2) Allocation by taxpayer's books. The portion of net  earnings  from
  self-employment  allocable  to the city may be determined from the books
  and records of a taxpayer's trade or business, if the  methods  used  in
  keeping  such  books  and the accuracy thereof are approved by the state
  tax commission as fairly and  equitably  reflecting  net  earnings  from
  self-employment within the city.
    (3)  Allocation  by  formula. If paragraph two of this subsection does
  not  apply  to  the  taxpayer,  the  portion  of   net   earnings   from
  self-employment allocable to the city shall be determined by multiplying
  (A)  net  earnings  from self-employment within and without the city, by
  (B) the average of the following three percentages:
    (i) Property percentage. The percentage computed by dividing  (I)  the
  average  of  the value, at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of
  real and tangible personal property connected with the net earnings from
  self-employment and located within the city, by (II) the average of  the
  value,  at  the  beginning  and end of the taxable year, of all real and
  tangible  personal  property  connected  with  the  net  earnings   from
  self-employment  and  located both within and without the city. For this
  purpose, real property shall include real  property,  whether  owned  or
  rented.
    (ii)  Payroll  percentage. The percentage computed by dividing (I) the
  total wages, salaries and other personal service  compensation  paid  or
  incurred during the taxable year to employees in connection with the net
  earnings  from  self-employment derived from a trade or business carried
  on within the city, by (II) the total of all wages, salaries  and  other
  personal  service  compensation paid or incurred during the taxable year
  to employees in connection with the net  earnings  from  self-employment
  derived  from a trade or business carried on both within and without the
  city.
    (iii) Gross income percentage. The percentage computed by dividing (I)
  the gross sales or charges for  services  performed  by  or  through  an
  agency  located within the city, by (II) the total of all gross sales or
  charges for services performed within and without the city. The sales or
  charges to be allocated to the city shall include all  sales  negotiated
  or  consummated,  and  charges  for  services performed, by an employee,
  agent, agency or independent contractor chiefly situated  at,  connected
  by  contract  or  otherwise  with,  or  sent  out from, offices or other
  agencies of the trade or business from which a taxpayer is deriving  net
  earnings from self-employment, situated within the city.
    (c)  Other  allocation  methods.  The  portion  of  net  earnings from
  self-employment allocable to the city shall be determined in  accordance
  with  rules  and  regulations  of  the  state tax commission if it shall
  appear to the tax commission that the net earnings from  self-employment
  are   not  fairly  and  equitably  reflected  under  the  provisions  of
  subsection (b) of this section.
    (d) Special rules for real estate.  Income  and  deductions  from  the
  rental  of  real  property  and gain and loss from the sale, exchange or
  other disposition of real property, shall not be subject  to  allocation
  under  subsection (b) or (c) of this section, but shall be considered as


 entirely derived from or connected with the place in which such property
  is located.
    §  5.  Accounting  periods  and  methods.  (a)  Accounting  periods. A
  taxpayer's taxable year under this local law shall be the  same  as  his
  taxable year for federal income tax purposes.
    (b)  Change  of  accounting  periods.  If a taxpayer's taxable year is
  changed for federal income tax purposes, his taxable year  for  purposes
  of  this  local  law  shall be similarly changed. If a taxable period of
  less than twelve months results from  a  change  of  taxable  year,  the
  exclusion  allowable  under  section  two  of  this  local  law shall be
  prorated under regulations of the state tax commission.
    (c) Accounting methods. A taxpayer's method of accounting  under  this
  local  law  shall  be  the  same as his method of accounting for federal
  income tax purposes. In the absence of  any  method  of  accounting  for
  federal  income  tax  purposes, net earnings from self-employment within
  the city shall be computed under such method as in the  opinion  of  the
  state  tax commission clearly reflects net earnings from self-employment
  within the city.
    (d) Change of accounting  methods.  (1)  If  a  taxpayer's  method  of
  accounting  is  changed  for  federal income tax purposes, his method of
  accounting for purposes of this local law shall be similarly changed.
    (2) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed, other  than  from
  an  accrual  to  an installment method, any additional tax which results
  from adjustments determined to be necessary  solely  by  reason  of  the
  change  shall  not  be  greater  than  if  such adjustments were ratably
  allocated and included for the  taxable  year  of  the  change  and  the
  preceding  taxable  years beginning after nineteen hundred eighty-three,
  not in excess of two, during which  the  taxpayer  used  the  method  of
  accounting from which the change is made.
    (3) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed from an accrual to
  an installment method, any additional tax for the year of such change of
  method  and for any subsequent year which is attributable to the receipt
  of installment payments properly accrued  in  a  prior  year,  shall  be
  reduced by the portion of tax for any prior taxable year attributable to
  the accrual of such installment payments, in accordance with regulations
  of the state tax commission.
    §  7.  Withholding of tax on wages. The provisions contained in part V
  of article twenty-two of the tax law (relating to withholding of tax  on
  wages)  shall  be  applicable with the same force and effect as if those
  provisions had been  incorporated  in  full  in  this  section  and  had
  expressly  referred  to  the  tax imposed by this local law except where
  inconsistent with the provisions of this local law, except that the term
  "aggregate amount"  contained  in  paragraphs  one,  two  and  three  of
  subsection  (a) of section six hundred seventy-four of the tax law shall
  mean the aggregate of the aggregate amounts of New York  state  personal
  income  tax,  city  earnings  tax on nonresidents authorized pursuant to
  article two-E of the general city law, city earnings tax on nonresidents
  authorized pursuant to article thirty-B of the tax  law,  city  personal
  income tax on residents authorized pursuant to article thirty of the tax
  law  and  city  income tax surcharge on residents authorized pursuant to
  article thirty-A of the tax law required to be deducted and withheld.
    § 8. Returns and payment  of  tax.  (a)  General.  On  or  before  the
  fifteenth  day  of  the  fourth month following the close of the taxable
  year, every person subject to the tax shall make and file a  return  and
  any  balance  of  the  tax shown due on the face of such return shall be
  paid therewith.  The state tax commission may,  by  regulation,  provide
  for  the filing of returns and payment of the tax at such other times as
  it deems necessary for the proper enforcement of  this  local  law.  The


 state  tax  commission  may  also  provide by regulation that any return
  otherwise required to be made and filed under  this  local  law  by  any
  nonresident  individual  need  not be made and filed if such nonresident
  individual  had,  during  the  taxable  year  to  which the return would
  relate, no net  earnings  from  self-employment  within  the  city.  Any
  regulation  allowing  such  waiver  of return may provide for additional
  limitations on and conditions and prerequisites to the privilege of  not
  filing a return.
    (b)  Decedents.  The  return for any deceased individual shall be made
  and filed by his executor, administrator, or other person  charged  with
  his  property.  If a final return of a decedent is for a fractional part
  of a year, the due date of such return shall be the fifteenth day of the
  fourth month following the close of the twelve-month period which  began
  with the first day of such fractional part of the year.
    (c)  Individuals  under a disability. The return for an individual who
  is unable to make a return by reason of  minority  or  other  disability
  shall  be  made and filed by his guardian, committee, fiduciary or other
  person charged with the care of his person or  property  (other  than  a
  receiver  in  possession of only a part of his property), or by his duly
  authorized agent.
    (d) Estates and trusts. The return for an estate  or  trust  shall  be
  made and filed by the fiduciary.
    (e)  Joint fiduciaries. If two or more fiduciaries are acting jointly,
  the return may be made by any one of them.
    (f) Cross reference. For  provisions  as  to  information  returns  by
  partnerships, employers and other persons, see section fourteen.
    § 9. Combined returns and employer's returns. The state tax commission
  may require:
    (1) The filing of any or all of the following:
    (A)  A combined return which in addition to the return provided for in
  a local law authorized by article thirty-B  of  the  tax  law  may  also
  include  returns  required  to  be filed under a local law authorized by
  article two-E of the general city law or article thirty or  thirty-A  of
  the tax law and under article twenty-two of the tax law.
    (B)  A  combined employer's return which in addition to the employer's
  return provided for in a local law authorized by article thirty-B of the
  tax law may also include employer's returns required to be filed under a
  local law authorized by article two-E of the general city law or article
  thirty or thirty-A of the tax law and under article  twenty-two  of  the
  tax law.
    (2) Where a combined return or employer's return is required, and with
  respect  to  the  payment of estimated tax, the state tax commission may
  also require payment of a single amount which shall be the total of  the
  amounts  (total  taxes  less any credits or refunds) required to be paid
  with the returns or employer's returns or in payment  of  estimated  tax
  pursuant  to the provisions of local laws imposed under the authority of
  article thirty-B of the tax law, article two-E of the general  city  law
  or  article  thirty  or  thirty-A  of  the  tax  law and pursuant to the
  provisions of article twenty-two of the tax law.
    § 10. Time and place for filing  returns  and  paying  tax.  A  person
  required  to  make and file a return under this local law shall, without
  assessment, notice or demand, pay any tax due thereon to the  state  tax
  commission   on  or  before  the  date  fixed  for  filing  such  return
  (determined without regard to any  extension  of  time  for  filing  the
  return).  The  state  tax  commission  shall prescribe by regulation the
  place for filing  any  return,  statement  or  other  document  required
  pursuant to this local law and for payment of any tax.


   § 11. Signing of returns and other documents. (a) General. Any return,
  statement  or  other document required to be made pursuant to this local
  law shall be signed  in  accordance  with  regulations  or  instructions
  prescribed  by  the  state tax commission. The fact that an individual's
  name  is signed to a return, statement or other document, shall be prima
  facie evidence for all purposes that  the  return,  statement  or  other
  document was actually signed by him.
    (b)  Partnerships. Any return, statement or other document required of
  a partnership shall be signed by one or more partners. The fact  that  a
  partner's name is signed to a return, statement or other document, shall
  be prima facie evidence for all purposes that such partner is authorized
  to sign on behalf of the partnership.
    (c)  Certifications.  The making or filing of any return, statement or
  other document or copy thereof required to be made or filed pursuant  to
  this local law, including a copy of a federal return, shall constitute a
  certification  by  the person making or filing such return, statement or
  other document or copy thereof that the statements contained therein are
  true and that any copy filed is a true copy.
    § 12. Change of residence status  during  year.  (a)  General.  If  an
  individual  changes  his status during his taxable year from resident to
  nonresident, or from nonresident to resident, he shall file a return  as
  a  nonresident  for  the  portion  of  the  year  during  which  he is a
  nonresident if he is subject to the tax imposed by this local law or, if
  not subject to such tax, an information return for the  portion  of  the
  year during which he is a nonresident, subject to such exceptions as the
  state  tax  commission  may  prescribe  by  regulation. Such information
  return shall be due at the same time as the return required by  a  local
  law authorized by article thirty-A of the tax law for the portion of the
  year during which such individual is a resident.
    (b)  City  taxable  wages  and  net  earnings from self-employment for
  portion of year individual is a nonresident. The city taxable wages  and
  net  earnings  from  self-employment  for the portion of the year during
  which the taxpayer is a  nonresident  shall  be  determined,  except  as
  provided  in subsection (c), under this local law as if his taxable year
  for federal income tax purposes  were  limited  to  the  period  of  his
  nonresident status.
    (c)  Special  accruals.  (1)  If  a individual changes his status from
  resident  to  nonresident,  he  shall,  regardless  of  his  method   of
  accounting,  accrue  for  the  portion of the taxable year prior to such
  change of status any items of income, gain, loss or  deduction  accruing
  prior  to  the  change  of  status, if not otherwise properly includible
  (whether or not because of an  election  to  report  on  an  installment
  basis)  or  allowable for city earnings tax purposes for such portion of
  the taxable year or a prior taxable year. The amounts  of  such  accrued
  items  shall  be  determined as if such accrued items were includible or
  allowable for federal self-employment tax purposes.
    (2) If an individual changes his status from nonresident to  resident,
  he shall, regardless of his method of accounting, accrue for the portion
  of  the taxable year prior to such change of status any items of income,
  gain, loss or deduction accruing prior to the change of status,  if  not
  otherwise  properly includible (whether or not because of an election to
  report on an installment basis) or allowable for federal self-employment
  tax purposes for such portion of the taxable year  or  a  prior  taxable
  year.  The  amounts of such accrued items shall be determined as if such
  accrued items were includible or allowable for  federal  self-employment
  tax purposes.
    (3)  No item of income, gain, loss or deduction which is accrued under
  this subsection shall be taken into account in determining city adjusted


 wages earned, or net earnings from self-employment, within the city, for
  any subsequent taxable period.
    (4)   Where   an  individual  changes  his  status  from  resident  to
  nonresident, the accruals under this subsection shall not be required if
  the individual files with the state  tax  commission  a  bond  or  other
  security acceptable to the commission, conditioned upon the inclusion of
  amounts accruable under this subsection in the determination of the city
  income tax surcharge under a local law authorized by article thirty-A of
  the  tax  law  for  one  or  more  subsequent  taxable  years  as if the
  individual had not changed his resident status. In such event,  the  tax
  under this local law shall not apply to such amounts.
    (d)  Prorations.  Where  an  individual  changes his status during his
  taxable year  from  resident  to  nonresident  or  from  nonresident  to
  resident,  the  exclusion  allowable under subsection (b) of section two
  shall be prorated, under regulations of the  state  tax  commission,  to
  reflect  the  portions  of  the  entire  taxable  year  during which the
  individual was a resident and a nonresident.
    § 13. Extensions of  time.  The  state  tax  commission  may  grant  a
  reasonable  extension  of time for payment of a tax or estimated tax (or
  any installment), or for filing any return, statement or other  document
  required  pursuant to this local law, on such terms and conditions as it
  may require. Except for a taxpayer who is outside the United  States  or
  who  intends to claim nonresident status pursuant to subparagraph (B) of
  paragraph one of subsection (f) of section one, no  such  extension  for
  filing any return, statement or other document shall exceed six months.
    §   14.   Requirements   concerning   returns,  notices,  records  and
  statements.   (a)  General.  The  state  tax  commission  may  prescribe
  regulations  as  to  the  keeping  of  records,  the content and form of
  returns and statements, and the filing of copies of federal  income  tax
  returns  and  determinations.  The  state tax commission may require any
  person, by regulation or notice served upon such person,  to  make  such
  returns,  render such statements, or keep such records, as the state tax
  commission may deem sufficient to show whether or  not  such  person  is
  liable under this local law for tax or for collection of tax.
    (b)  Partnerships.  Every  partnership  doing business in the city and
  having no partners who are residents shall make a return for the taxable
  year setting forth all items of income, gain,  loss  and  deduction  and
  such  other  pertinent  information  as  the state tax commission may by
  regulations and instructions prescribe. Such return shall be filed on or
  before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of each
  taxable year. For purposes of this subsection, "taxable  year"  means  a
  year  or a period which would be a taxable year of the partnership if it
  were subject to tax under this local law.
    (c) Information at source. The  state  tax  commission  may  prescribe
  regulations and instructions requiring returns of information to be made
  and  filed  on  or  before February twenty-eighth of each year as to the
  payment or crediting in any calendar year  of  amounts  of  six  hundred
  dollars  or  more to any taxpayer under this local law. Such returns may
  be required of any person, including lessees or mortgagors  of  real  or
  personal   property,   fiduciaries,  employers,  and  all  officers  and
  employees of this state,  or  any  municipal  corporation  or  political
  subdivision  of  this  state,  having  the  control,  receipt,  custody,
  disposal or payment  of  interest,  rents,  salaries,  wages,  premiums,
  annuities,  compensation,  remunerations,  emoluments  or other fixed or
  determinable gains, profits or income, except interest  coupons  payable
  to  bearer.  A  duplicate  of the statement as to tax withheld on wages,
  required to be furnished by an employer to an employee, shall constitute


 the return of information required to be made under  this  section  with
  respect to such wages.
    (d)  Notice of qualification as receiver, etc. Every receiver, trustee
  in  bankruptcy,  assignee  for  benefit  of  creditors,  or  other  like
  fiduciary  shall  give  notice of his qualification as such to the state
  tax commission, as may be required by regulation.
    § 15. Report of change in federal or New York state taxable income. If
  the amount of a taxpayer's federal or New York state taxable  income  or
  self-employment  income  reported  on  his federal or New York state tax
  return for any taxable year is changed or corrected by the United States
  internal revenue service or the New York state commissioner of  taxation
  and  finance  or  other  competent  authority,  or  as  the  result of a
  renegotiation of a contract or subcontract with the United States or New
  York state or if a taxpayer, pursuant to subsection (d) of  section  six
  thousand  two  hundred thirteen of the internal revenue code, executes a
  notice of waiver of the restrictions provided in subsection (a) of  said
  section  or  if  a  taxpayer,  pursuant to subsection (f) of section six
  hundred eighty-one of the tax law executes a notice  of  waiver  of  the
  restrictions  provided  in subsection (c) of said section, or if any tax
  on self-employment income in addition to that shown  on  his  return  is
  assessed, the taxpayer shall report such change or correction in federal
  or  New  York  state  taxable income or such execution of such notice of
  waiver or such assessment and the changes or corrections of his  federal
  or  New  York state taxable income or self-employment income on which it
  is based, within ninety days  after  the  final  determination  of  such
  change,  correction,  or renegotiation, or such execution of such notice
  of waiver or the making of such assessment as otherwise required by  the
  commissioner,  and  shall  concede the accuracy of such determination or
  state wherein it is erroneous. Any taxpayer filing an amended federal or
  New York state income or self-employment income tax  return  shall  also
  file  within  ninety  days thereafter an amended return under this local
  law, and shall give such information as the  commissioner  may  require.
  The  commissioner  may  by  regulation  prescribe such exceptions to the
  requirements of this  section  as  he  or  she  deems  appropriate.  For
  purposes  of  this  section,  (i)  the  term  "taxpayer" shall include a
  partnership having any income derived from city sources,  and  (ii)  the
  term  "federal  income  tax  return" shall include the returns of income
  required under section six thousand thirty-one of the  internal  revenue
  code.  Reports  made  under this section by a partnership shall indicate
  the portion of the  change  in  each  item  of  income,  gain,  loss  or
  deduction allocable to each partner and shall set forth such identifying
  information  with  respect  to  such partner as may be prescribed by the
  commissioner.
    § 16. Effect of invalidity in part; inconsistencies with  other  laws.
  (a)  If  any clause, sentence, paragraph, subsection, section, provision
  or other portion of this local law or the  application  thereof  to  any
  person  or circumstances shall be held to be invalid, such holding shall
  not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder of this local law or  the

   §  1402.  Imposition  of  tax.    (a)  A tax is hereby imposed on each
  conveyance of real property or interest therein when  the  consideration
  exceeds  five  hundred dollars, at the rate of two dollars for each five
  hundred dollars or fractional part thereof; provided, however, that with
  respect to (A) a conveyance of a one, two or three-family house  and  an
  individual  residential  condominium unit, or interests therein; and (B)
  conveyances where the consideration is less than five  hundred  thousand
  dollars,  the  consideration for the interest conveyed shall exclude the
  value of any lien or  encumbrance  remaining  thereon  at  the  time  of
  conveyance. The rate of this tax shall be: (1) two dollars for each five
  hundred  dollars  or  fractional part thereof on all conveyances of real
  property or interest therein; plus (2)  an  additional  one  dollar  and
  twenty-five  cents  for  each  five  hundred  dollars or fractional part
  thereof of consideration on each conveyance of real property or interest
  therein within any city in this state having a population of one million
  or more  (i)  when  the  consideration  for  the  entire  conveyance  of
  residential  real  property  is  three million dollars or more, and (ii)
  when the consideration for the entire conveyance of any  other  property
  is   two  million  dollars  or  more.  For  purposes  of  this  section,
  residential real property shall include any premises that is or  may  be
  used  in  whole  or in part as a personal residence, and shall include a
  one, two, or three-family house, an individual condominium  unit,  or  a
  cooperative apartment unit.
    (b)  (1)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of subdivision (a) of this
  section, in the case  of  any  real  estate  investment  trust  transfer
  occurring  on  or  after the effective date of this subdivision, the tax
  imposed under subdivision (a) of this section shall be  imposed  at  the
  rate  of  one  dollar  for  each five hundred dollars or fractional part
  thereof of consideration.
    (2) (A) For purposes  of  this  subdivision,  the  term  "real  estate
  investment  trust"  (hereinafter referred to as a "REIT") shall have the
  same meaning as in section 856 of the internal revenue code.
    (B)  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  the  phrase  "real  estate
  investment trust transfer" shall mean any conveyance of real property or
  an  interest  therein  to  a REIT, or to a partnership or corporation in
  which a REIT owns  a  controlling  interest  immediately  following  the
  conveyance,  which  conveyance (I) occurs in connection with the initial
  formation of the REIT, provided that the conditions set forth in clauses
  (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph are satisfied, or (II) in the case  of
  any  real  estate  investment  trust transfer occurring on or after July
  thirteenth, nineteen hundred ninety-six and before September first,  two
  thousand   twenty-six,  is  described  in  the  last  sentence  of  this
  subparagraph.
    (i) The value of  the  ownership  interests  in  the  REIT,  or  in  a
  partnership  or  corporation  in  which  the  REIT  owns  a  controlling
  interest, received by the grantor as consideration for  such  conveyance
  must  be  equal to an amount not less than forty percent of the value of
  the equity interest in the real property or interest therein conveyed by
  the grantor to the grantee and such ownership interests must be retained
  by the grantor or owners of the grantor for a period of  not  less  than
  two  years  following the date of conveyance; provided, however, that in
  the case of the death of the grantor or an owner of the  grantor  within
  such  two  year  period,  this  two  year retention requirement shall be
  deemed to be satisfied notwithstanding any conveyance of such  ownership
  interests  held  by such individual as a result of such death. The value
  of the equity interest in such real property or interest  therein  shall
  be  computed  by  subtracting  from the consideration for the conveyance
  (determined in accordance with paragraph three of this subdivision)  the


 unpaid  balance  of any loans secured by mortgages or other encumbrances
  which are liens on the real property  or  interest  therein  immediately
  before  the conveyance. For purposes of this computation, in the case of
  a  conveyance of real property or interest therein other than a transfer
  or an acquisition of a controlling interest, the amount  of  the  unpaid
  balance  of  any  loans secured by mortgages or other encumbrances to be
  subtracted from consideration is determined  by  multiplying  the  total
  unpaid  balance  of any loans secured by mortgages or other encumbrances
  on the real property or  interest  therein  by  the  percentage  of  the
  ownership  interest  in  the  real  property  or  interest therein being
  conveyed to the grantee. In the case of a conveyance which is a transfer
  or  an  acquisition  of  a  controlling  interest,  such  amount  to  be
  subtracted  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  following  amounts:  (I) a
  reasonable apportionment to the interests in real property owned by  the
  entity  of  the  amount  of  any  loans  secured  by encumbrances on the
  ownership interests  in  the  entity  which  are  being  transferred  or
  acquired  and (II) the amount of any loans secured by mortgages or other
  encumbrances on the real  property  of  the  entity  multiplied  by  the
  percentage  interest  in  the  entity  which  is  being  transferred  or
  acquired. Provided, however that, for purposes of this computation,  any
  mortgages or other encumbrances on the real property or interest therein
  which  are created in contemplation of the initial formation of the REIT
  or in contemplation of the conveyance of such real property or  interest
  therein to the REIT or to a partnership or corporation in which the REIT
  owns  a  controlling interest immediately following the conveyance shall
  not be considered.
    (ii) Seventy-five percent or more of the  cash  proceeds  received  by
  such  REIT  from  the  sale of ownership interests in such REIT upon its
  initial formation must be used: (I) to make payments on loans secured by
  any interest in real property (including an  ownership  interest  in  an
  entity  owning  real  property) which is owned directly or indirectly by
  such REIT; (II) to pay for capital improvements to real property or  any
  interest therein owned directly or indirectly by such REIT; (III) to pay
  costs,  fees,  and  expenses  (including brokerage fees and commissions,
  professional fees and payments to  or  on  behalf  of  a  tenant  as  an
  inducement  to  enter  into  a lease or sublease) incurred in connection
  with the creation of a leasehold or sublease pertaining to real property
  or any interest therein owned directly or indirectly by such REIT;  (IV)
  to  acquire  any  interest  in  real  property  (including  an ownership
  interest in any entity owning real property), apart from any acquisition
  to  which  a  reduced  rate  of  tax  is  applicable  pursuant  to  this
  subdivision  (without  regard  to  this  clause);  or  (V)  for reserves
  established for any of the purposes described in subclause (I), (II)  or
  (III)  of  this  clause.  For  purposes  of  this  clause, the term real
  property shall include real property wherever located.
    If a conveyance otherwise described in this subparagraph occurs  other
  than  in  connection with the initial formation of a REIT, the condition
  set forth in clause (ii) of this subparagraph shall be  disregarded  and
  such  conveyance  shall  constitute  a  "real  estate  investment  trust
  transfer" if the condition set forth in clause (i) of this  subparagraph
  would  be  satisfied  if  "fifty  percent"  were  substituted for "forty
  percent" therein.
    (3) For purposes of measuring consideration  under  this  subdivision,
  the  fair  market  value  of the real property or interest therein being
  conveyed shall be calculated by dividing (i)  the  net  cash  flow  from
  operations  with  respect  to  such  real  property for the twelve-month
  period ending on the last day of the second month preceding the date  of
  the  conveyance  by  (ii)  the  sum  of  (A)  the federal long-term rate


 compounded  semi-annually  that  is  determined  by  the  United  States
  secretary  of the treasury under section 1274(d) of the internal revenue
  code in effect thirty days prior to the date of the conveyance  and  (B)
  two percentage points. Provided however, if the commissioner of taxation
  and  finance  determines  that  either  the amount in clause (i) of this
  paragraph or clause (ii)  of  this  paragraph  does  not  result  in  an
  accurate  representation  of the fair market value of such real property
  or interest therein as  such  value  is  to  be  determined  under  this
  paragraph,  the  commissioner may adjust either of such amounts. In lieu
  of utilizing the method prescribed in  this  paragraph  for  determining
  fair  market  value, the taxpayer may utilize any method for determining
  fair market value that the commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  has
  prescribed in rules or regulations or otherwise.




   §  1402-a.  Additional  tax.  (a)  In  addition  to the tax imposed by
  section fourteen hundred two of this article, a tax is hereby imposed on
  each conveyance of residential real property or  interest  therein  when
  the  consideration  for  the entire conveyance is one million dollars or
  more.  For purposes of this section,  residential  real  property  shall
  include  any  premises  that  is or may be used in whole or in part as a
  personal residence, and shall include a one, two, or three-family house,
  an individual condominium unit, or a  cooperative  apartment  unit.  The
  rate  of  such  tax  shall  be  one percent of the consideration or part
  thereof attributable to the residential real property. Such tax shall be
  paid at the same time and in the same  manner  as  the  tax  imposed  by
  section fourteen hundred two of this article.
    (b)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  (a) of section
  fourteen hundred four of this article, the  additional  tax  imposed  by
  this  section shall be paid by the grantee. If the grantee has failed to
  pay the tax imposed by this article at  the  time  required  by  section
  fourteen  hundred  ten  of this article or if the grantee is exempt from
  such tax, the grantor shall have the duty to  pay  the  tax.  Where  the
  grantor  has  the  duty to pay the tax because the grantee has failed to
  pay, such tax shall be the joint and several liability  of  the  grantor
  and the grantee.
    (c)  Except  as otherwise provided in this section, all the provisions
  of this  article  relating  to  or  applicable  to  the  administration,
  collection, determination and distribution of the tax imposed by section
  fourteen  hundred  two  of  this  article shall apply to the tax imposed
  under the authority of this section with such modifications  as  may  be
  necessary  to  adapt  such  language  to  the  tax  so  authorized. Such
  provisions shall apply with the  same  force  and  effect  as  if  those
  provisions  had been set forth in this section except to the extent that
  any provision is either inconsistent with a provision of this section or
  not relevant to the tax authorized by this section.




   §  1402-b.  Supplemental  tax  in  cities  having  a population of one
  million or more. (a) In  addition  to  the  taxes  imposed  by  sections
  fourteen  hundred  two and fourteen hundred two-a of this article, a tax
  is hereby imposed on each conveyance of  residential  real  property  or
  interest  therein  within  any city in this state having a population of
  one million or more when the consideration for  the  conveyance  is  two
  million  dollars or more. For purposes of this section, residential real
  property shall include any premises that is or may be used in  whole  or
  in  part  as  a  personal  residence,  and  shall include a one, two, or
  three-family house, an individual condominium  unit,  or  a  cooperative
  apartment  unit. Such tax shall be paid at the same time and in the same
  manner as the  taxes  imposed  by  sections  fourteen  hundred  two  and
  fourteen hundred two-a of this article.
    The rate of such tax shall be:
    (1)  one-quarter  of  one percent of the consideration or part thereof
  attributable to the residential real property  when  such  consideration
  for  the entire conveyance is at least two million dollars but less than
  three million dollars;
    (2) one-half of one percent  of  the  consideration  or  part  thereof
  attributable  to  the  residential real property when such consideration
  for the entire conveyance is at least three  million  dollars  but  less
  than five million dollars;
    (3)  one  and one-quarter percent of the consideration or part thereof
  attributable to the residential real property  when  such  consideration
  for the entire conveyance is at least five million dollars but less than
  ten million dollars;
    (4)  two  and one-quarter percent of the consideration or part thereof
  attributable to the residential real property  when  such  consideration
  for  the entire conveyance is at least ten million dollars but less than
  fifteen million dollars;
    (5) two and one-half percent of  the  consideration  or  part  thereof
  attributable  to  the  residential real property when such consideration
  for the entire conveyance is at least fifteen million dollars  but  less
  than twenty million dollars;
    (6)  two  and  three-quarters  percent  of  the  consideration or part
  thereof  attributable  to  the  residential  real  property  when   such
  consideration  for  the  entire  conveyance  is  at least twenty million
  dollars but less than twenty-five million dollars; and
    (7) two and nine-tenths percent of the consideration or  part  thereof
  attributable  to  the  residential real property when such consideration

    (b) Notwithstanding the  provisions  of  subdivision  (a)  of  section
  fourteen  hundred  four of this article, the tax imposed by this section
  shall be paid by the grantee. If the grantee has failed to pay  the  tax
  imposed by this article at the time required by section fourteen hundred
  ten  of  this  article  or  if  the grantee is exempt from such tax, the
  grantor shall have the duty to pay the tax. Where the  grantor  has  the
  duty  to  pay  the  tax  because the grantee has failed to pay, such tax
  shall be the joint and several liability of the grantor and the grantee.
    (c) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all  the  provisions
  of  this  article  relating  to  or  applicable  to  the administration,
  collection, determination and distribution of the tax imposed by section
  fourteen hundred two of this article shall  apply  to  the  tax  imposed
  under  the  authority  of this section with such modifications as may be
  necessary to  adapt  such  language  to  the  tax  so  authorized.  Such
  provisions  shall  apply  with  the  same  force  and effect as if those
  provisions had been set forth in this section except to the extent  that


 any provision is either inconsistent with a provision of this section or
  not relevant to the tax authorized by this section.




   §  1404.  Liability  for tax. (a) The real estate transfer tax imposed
  pursuant to section fourteen hundred two of this article shall  be  paid
  by  the  grantor  and  such  tax  shall  not  be  payable,  directly  or
  indirectly, by the grantee except as  provided  in  a  contract  between
  grantor  and  grantee  or  as otherwise provided in this section. If the
  grantor has failed to pay the tax imposed by this article  at  the  time
  required  by  section  fourteen  hundred  ten  of this article or if the
  grantor is exempt from such tax, the grantee shall have the duty to  pay
  the  tax.  Where  the  grantee  has  the duty to pay the tax because the
  grantor has failed to pay, such tax  shall  be  the  joint  and  several
  liability  of the grantor and the grantee; provided that in the event of
  such failure, the grantee shall have  a  cause  of  action  against  the
  grantor  for  recovery of payment of such tax, interest and penalties by
  the grantee. In the case of a conveyance of residential real property as
  defined in subdivision (a) of section fourteen  hundred  two-a  of  this
  article,  if  the  tax  imposed  by  this article is paid by the grantee
  pursuant to a contract between the grantor and the grantee,  the  amount
  of  such  tax  shall  be  excluded from the calculation of consideration
  subject to tax under this article.
    (b) For the purpose of the proper administration of this  article  and
  to  prevent evasion of the tax hereby imposed, it shall be presumed that
  all conveyances are taxable. Where the consideration  includes  property
  other  than  money,  it  shall be presumed that the consideration is the
  fair market value of  the  real  property  or  interest  therein.  These
  presumptions  shall prevail until the contrary is proven, and the burden
  of proving the contrary shall be on the person liable for payment of the
  tax.




   §  1405. Exemptions. (a) The following shall be exempt from payment of
  the real estate transfer tax:
    1. The state of New York, or any of its  agencies,  instrumentalities,
  political  subdivisions,  or  public  corporations  (including  a public
  corporation created pursuant to agreement or compact with another  state
  or the Dominion of Canada).
    2.  The  United  Nations,  the United States of America and any of its
  agencies and instrumentalities.
    The exemption of  such  governmental  bodies  or  persons  shall  not,
  however, relieve a grantee from them of liability for the tax.
    (b) The tax shall not apply to the following conveyances:
    1.  Conveyances  to  the United Nations, the United States of America,
  the state of New York, or any of their  instrumentalities,  agencies  or
  political  subdivisions  (or  any public corporation, including a public
  corporation created pursuant to agreement or compact with another  state
  or the Dominion of Canada);
    2.  Conveyances  which  are  or  were  used  to secure a debt or other
  obligation;
    3.  Conveyances  which,  without  additional  consideration,  confirm,
  correct, modify or supplement a prior conveyance;
    4.  Conveyances  of  real property without consideration and otherwise
  than in connection with a sale, including conveyances  conveying  realty
  as bona fide gifts;
    5. Conveyances given in connection with a tax sale;
    6.  Conveyances  to  effectuate  a  mere change of identity or form of
  ownership or  organization  where  there  is  no  change  in  beneficial
  ownership,  other  than conveyances to a cooperative housing corporation
  of the real property comprising the cooperative dwelling or dwellings;
    7. Conveyances which consist of a deed of partition;
    8. Conveyances given pursuant to the federal bankruptcy act;
    9. Conveyances of real property which consist of the  execution  of  a
  contract  to  sell  real  property  without the use or occupancy of such
  property or the granting of an option to purchase real property  without
  the use or occupancy of such property;
    10.  Conveyances  of  an  option or contract to purchase real property
  with the use or occupancy of such property where  the  consideration  is
  less than two hundred thousand dollars and such property was used solely
  by  the  grantor as his personal residence and consists of a one, two or
  three-family house, an individual residential condominium  unit  or  the
  sale  of  stock  in a cooperative housing corporation in connection with
  the grant or transfer of a proprietary leasehold covering an  individual
  residential cooperative unit.
    11. Conveyances of real property located in tax-free NY areas approved
  pursuant  to  article  twenty-one  of  the  economic  development law to
  businesses located in such areas that are participating in the  START-UP
  NY program pursuant to such article twenty-one.




   §  1405-A. Credit. A grantor shall be allowed a credit against the tax
  due on a conveyance of real property to the extent tax was paid by  such
  grantor  on  a  prior creation of a leasehold of all or a portion of the
  same real property or on the  granting  of  an  option  or  contract  to
  purchase  all  or  a portion of the same real property, by such grantor.
  Such credit shall be  computed  by  multiplying  the  tax  paid  on  the
  creation  of  the leasehold or on the granting of the option or contract
  by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the  consideration
  used  to  compute  such tax paid which is not yet due to such grantor on
  the date of the subsequent conveyance (and which such grantor  will  not
  be entitled to receive after such date), and the denominator of which is
  the total value of the consideration used to compute such tax paid.




   §    1405-B.    Cooperative   housing   corporation   transfers.   (a)
  Notwithstanding the definition of "controlling  interest"  contained  in
  subdivision  (b)  of  section  fourteen  hundred  one of this article or
  anything to  the  contrary  contained  in  subdivision  (e)  of  section
  fourteen  hundred  one  of this article, the tax imposed by this article
  shall apply to (1) the original conveyance  of  shares  of  stock  in  a
  cooperative housing corporation in connection with the grant or transfer
  of a proprietary leasehold by the cooperative corporation or cooperative
  plan  sponsor,  and  (2)  the  subsequent  conveyance of such stock in a
  cooperative housing corporation in connection with the grant or transfer
  of a proprietary leasehold by the owner thereof.  With  respect  to  any
  such   subsequent   conveyance  where  the  property  is  an  individual
  residential unit, the consideration  for  the  interest  conveyed  shall
  exclude  the  value  of  any  liens  on  certificates  of stock or other
  evidences of an ownership interest in and a  proprietary  lease  from  a
  corporation  or  partnership  formed  for  the  purpose  of  cooperative
  ownership of residential interest in real estate  remaining  thereon  at
  the time of conveyance. In determining the tax on a conveyance described
  in  paragraph  one  of this subdivision, a credit shall be allowed for a
  proportionate part of the amount of any tax paid upon the conveyance  to
  the  cooperative housing corporation of the real property comprising the
  cooperative dwelling or dwellings to the  extent  that  such  conveyance
  effectuated  a  mere  change  of  identity  or form of ownership of such
  property and not a change in the beneficial ownership of such  property.
  The  amount  of the credit shall be determined by multiplying the amount
  of tax paid upon the conveyance to the cooperative  housing  corporation
  by  a  percentage  representing  the  extent  to  which  such conveyance
  effectuated a mere change of identity or form of  ownership  and  not  a
  change   in   the  beneficial  ownership  of  such  property,  and  then
  multiplying the resulting product by a fraction, the numerator of  which
  shall  be  the  number  of  shares  of  stock  conveyed in a transaction
  described in paragraph one of this subdivision and  the  denominator  of
  which  shall  be  the total number of shares of stock of the cooperative
  housing corporation (including any stock held by the corporation). In no
  event, however, shall such  credit  reduce  the  tax,  on  a  conveyance
  described  in  paragraph  one of this subdivision, below zero, nor shall
  any such credit be allowed for a tax paid more than  twenty-four  months
  prior  to  the date on which occurs the first in a series of conveyances
  of shares of stock in an offering  of  cooperative  housing  corporation
  shares described in paragraph one of this subdivision.
    (b) Every cooperative housing corporation shall be required to file an
  information return with the commissioner of taxation and finance by July
  fifteenth  of  each  year covering the preceding period of January first
  through June thirty-first and by January fifteenth of each year covering
  the preceding period of July first through  December  thirty-first.  The
  return shall contain such information regarding the conveyance of shares
  of  stock in the cooperative housing corporation as the commissioner may
  deem necessary, including but not limited to, the names,  addresses  and
  employee  identification  numbers  or  social  security  numbers  of the
  grantor and the grantee, the number of shares conveyed, the date of  the
  conveyance   and   the  consideration  paid  for  such  conveyance.  The
  commissioner of taxation and finance may enter into  an  agreement  with
  the  chief  fiscal  officer  of  the  city of New York to provide that a
  single information return may be filed for purposes of the  tax  imposed
  by this article and the real property transfer tax imposed by such city.
    (c)  The  information contained within information returns filed under
  subdivision (b) of this section may be provided by the  commissioner  to
  local  assessors  for  use in real property tax administration, and such
 information shall not be subject to the secrecy provisions set forth  in
  section  fourteen  hundred  eighteen of this chapter, provided, however,
  that the commissioner shall not  disclose  social  security  numbers  or
  employer identification numbers.




   §  1406.  Preparation and sale of stamps. (a) The tax commission shall
  prepare adhesive documentary stamps for  purposes  of  the  real  estate
  transfer  tax of such design, in such form, in such denominations and in
  such quantities as it may from time to  time  deem  advisable.  The  tax
  commission  shall make provision for the sale of such stamps by its duly
  authorized agent or agents in such places, at such times and subject  to
  such terms and conditions as in its judgment may be necessary.
    (b)  The tax commission may from time to time and as often as it deems
  advisable provide for the issuance and exclusive use of stamps of a  new
  design  and  forbid  the use of stamps of any other design.  In order to
  make such a change and discontinue the use of stamps of a former design,
  the tax commission shall publish once in each week  for  each  of  three
  months  immediately  preceding  the  time  when  such  change shall take
  effect, in one or more daily newspapers published in each of  the  first
  and  second class cities of the state, a notice to the effect that after
  a certain date, which shall be at least three  months  after  the  first
  publication of such notice, only the new issue or design of stamps shall
  be  accepted  or  used  to  pay the real estate transfer tax. After such
  date, it shall be unlawful for any person to make use of any other  than
  the new issue or design of stamps in payment of such tax.
    (c)  Any  person  lawfully in possession of unused stamps of an old or
  superseded issue or design may, within ninety days from  the  time  when
  such  change  becomes  effective, surrender the unused stamps to the tax
  commission together with a sworn statement setting forth  the  name  and
  address  of  the  owner and party surrendering the stamps, how, when and
  from whom they were acquired and  such  other  information  as  the  tax
  commission  may require. The tax commission shall redeem such unused and
  surrendered stamps by exchanging stamps of a like  denomination  of  the
  new issue or design for them.
    (d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of sections seven and eight of the
  state printing law, the tax commission is hereby directed to make, enter
  into and execute for and  on  behalf  of  the  state  such  contract  or
  contracts for dyes, plates and printing necessary for the manufacture of
  the stamps provided for by this article. The tax commission shall be the
  custodian  of  all  stamps,  dyes,  plates  or  other  material or thing
  furnished by it and used in the manufacture of such state tax stamps.
    (e) This section shall not apply to the  extent  the  commissioner  of
  taxation  and finance chooses not to use documentary stamps for purposes
  of this tax.




   §  1407.  Designation  of agents. (a) The commissioner of taxation and
  finance is authorized to designate such banks, trust companies,  savings
  banks,  New  York  state  branches  of a foreign bank, industrial banks,
  savings and loan associations, national  banking  associations,  federal
  savings   and   loan  associations,  title  insurance  corporations  and
  recording officers as he shall deem necessary to act as  his  agent  for
  purposes of collecting the tax imposed by this article. The commissioner
  of  taxation  and finance shall provide for the manner in which any such
  person may be  designated  as  his  agent  subject  to  such  terms  and
  conditions  as he shall prescribe. The real estate transfer tax shall be
  paid to such agents as provided in section fourteen hundred ten of  this
  article.  At  the  time such a person shall be designated as an agent of
  the commissioner of taxation and finance, the commissioner  of  taxation
  and  finance  shall  prescribe whether such agent shall collect the real
  estate transfer tax through the sale of documentary stamps, through  the
  use of a metering machine, by any other method which the commissioner of
  taxation  and  finance, by regulation, may provide, or by one or more of
  such methods.
    (b) Every person designated to act as an agent pursuant to subdivision
  (a) of this section shall remit to  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance  any  funds  collected  by such agent and any returns filed with
  such agent under this article, less any fee  allowed  under  subdivision
  (c)  of  this section, at such times as the commissioner of taxation and
  finance shall prescribe and shall follow such procedures and  keep  such
  records  as the commissioner of taxation and finance may prescribe. Each
  county (other than the counties comprising New York city) and  New  York
  city shall pay all expenses occasioned by the duties of their respective
  recording officers to collect the tax imposed by this article, including
  any expense for extra clerks.
    (c)  1.  When  a  recording officer designated to act as such agent is
  presented with a conveyance for  recording  that  is  accompanied  by  a
  receipt  issued  by  the  commissioner  pursuant  to  subdivision (c) of
  section fourteen hundred twenty-three of this  article,  such  recording
  officer  shall  be  relieved  of  the responsibility to collect the real
  estate transfer tax thereon. He or she shall nonetheless be entitled  to
  the  portion  of  such  tax that he or she would otherwise have retained
  pursuant to this subdivision, as provided by subdivision (b) of  section
  fourteen hundred twenty-three of the tax law.
    2.  When  a  recording  officer  is  presented  with  a conveyance for
  recording that is not accompanied by a receipt  described  in  paragraph
  one  of  this  subdivision,  he or she shall collect the applicable real
  estate transfer tax and shall retain, from the real estate transfer  tax
  which  he  or  she collects, the sum of one dollar for each of the first
  five thousand conveyances accepted for recording and for which he or she
  has issued a documentary stamp or metering machine stamp or  upon  which
  instrument  effecting  the conveyance he or she has noted payment of the
  tax or that no tax is due, pursuant to any other method for  payment  of
  the  tax provided for in the regulations of the commissioner of taxation
  and finance, during each annual period commencing on the  first  day  of
  August  and  ending  on the next succeeding thirty-first day of July and
  seventy-five cents for  each  conveyance  in  excess  of  five  thousand
  accepted  for  recording and for which he or she has issued such a stamp
  or upon which instrument effecting the conveyance he or  she  has  noted
  payment of the tax or that no tax is due, pursuant to such other method,
  during  such  annual  period.  Such fee shall be payable even though the
  stamp issued or such notation shows that no tax is due. Such a fee  paid
  to  the register of the city of New York shall belong to the city of New
  York and such a fee paid to a recording officer of a county outside such


 city shall belong to such officer's county. With respect  to  any  other
  agents  designated  to  act pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section,
  the commissioner of  taxation  and  finance  shall  have  the  power  to
  provide,  at  his or her discretion, for payment of a fee to such agent,
  in such manner and amount and subject to such limitations as he  or  she
  may  determine,  but  any  such  fee  for any annual period shall not be
  greater than the sum of one dollar for each of the first  five  thousand
  conveyances  for  which  such  agent  has  issued a documentary stamp or
  metering machine stamp or upon which instrument effecting the conveyance
  he or she has noted payment of the tax or that no tax is  due,  pursuant
  to  any  other  method  for  payment  of  the  tax  provided  for in the
  regulations of the commissioner of taxation  and  finance,  during  such
  annual  period  and  seventy-five cents for each conveyance in excess of
  five thousand for which such agent has issued such a stamp or upon which
  instrument effecting the conveyance such agent has noted payment of  the
  tax  or  that  no tax is due, pursuant to such other method, during such
  annual period.




   §  1408.  Liability  of  recording officer. A recording officer or any
  other person designated to act as agent  pursuant  to  section  fourteen
  hundred seven of this article shall not be liable under this section for
  any  inaccuracy in the amount of tax he shall collect under this article
  so long as he shall compute and  collect  such  tax  on  the  amount  of
  consideration  or  the  value of the interest conveyed as such amount is
  stated on the return required to be filed pursuant to  section  fourteen
  hundred nine of this article.




   §  1409.  Returns.  (a)  (1) A joint return shall be filed by both the
  grantor and the grantee for each conveyance whether or not a tax is  due
  thereon  other  than  a conveyance of an easement or license to a public
  utility  as  defined  in  subdivision  two  of   section   one   hundred
  eighty-six-a  of this chapter or to a public utility which is a provider
  of telecommunication services as defined in subdivision one  of  section
  one hundred eighty-six-e of this chapter, where the consideration is two
  dollars  or  less  and  is clearly stated as actual consideration in the
  instrument of conveyance.
    (2) When the grantor or grantee of a  deed  for  a  building  used  as
  residential real property containing up to four family dwelling units is
  a  limited liability company, the joint return shall not be accepted for
  filing unless it is accompanied by a document which identifies the names
  and  business  addresses  of  all  members,  managers,  and  any   other
  authorized  persons,  if  any, of such limited liability company and the
  names and business addresses or, if none, the business addresses of  all
  shareholders, directors, officers, members, managers and partners of any
  limited  liability  company  or other business entity that are to be the
  members, managers  or  authorized  persons,  if  any,  of  such  limited
  liability  company. The identification of such names and addresses shall
  not be deemed an unwarranted invasion of personal  privacy  pursuant  to
  article  six  of the public officers law. If any such member, manager or
  authorized person of the limited liability company is itself  a  limited
  liability  company or other business entity other than a publicly traded
  entity, a REIT, a UPREIT, or a mutual fund, the names and  addresses  of
  the shareholders, directors, officers, members, managers and partners of
  the  limited  liability  company  or other business entity shall also be
  disclosed until full disclosure of ultimate ownership by natural persons
  is achieved. For purposes of  this  subdivision,  the  terms  "members",
  "managers",  "authorized person", "limited liability company" and "other
  business entity" shall have the same meaning as those terms are  defined
  in section one hundred two of the limited liability company law.
    (3)  The  return  shall be filed with the recording officer before the
  instrument effecting the conveyance may be recorded. However, if the tax
  is paid to the commissioner pursuant to section fourteen hundred ten  of
  this  article,  the  return shall be filed with such commissioner at the
  time the tax is paid. In that instance, a receipt evidencing the  filing
  of  the  return and the payment of tax shall be filed with the recording
  officer before the instrument effecting the conveyance may be  recorded.
  The  recording officer shall handle such receipt in the same manner as a
  return filed with the recording officer.
    (b) Subject to the provisions of section fourteen hundred twenty-three
  of this article, the return shall be signed by both the grantor and  the
  grantee.  Where  a conveyance has more than one grantor or more than one
  grantee, the return  shall  be  signed  by  all  of  such  grantors  and
  grantees. Where any or all of the grantors or any or all of the grantees
  have failed to sign a return, it shall be accepted as a return if signed
  by  any  one  of  the  grantors or by any one of the grantees. Provided,
  however, those not signing the return  shall  not  be  relieved  of  any
  liability  for  the  tax  imposed  by  this  article  and  the period of
  limitations for assessment of tax or of additional tax shall  not  apply
  to any such party.
    (c)  Returns  shall  be preserved for three years and thereafter until
  the commissioner of taxation and finance permits them to be destroyed.
    (d) The commissioner shall prescribe  the  form  of  the  return,  the
  information  which  it  shall  contain  and the documentation that shall
  accompany  the  return.  The  commissioner  shall  prescribe  that,  for
  recorded conveyances, such return shall be included on the form required


 to  be  filed  with a conveyance of real property by section two hundred
  fifty-three-b  of  this  chapter   and   the   regulations   promulgated
  thereunder,  except  that such commissioner may prescribe a supplemental
  form for purposes of the tax imposed by this article when the conveyance
  is  pursuant  to or in lieu of foreclosure or the conveyance consists in
  part of a mere change of identity or form of ownership  or  organization
  or the conveyance is one for which a credit for tax previously paid will
  be  claimed.  In  addition,  the  commissioner,  in  the  commissioner's
  discretion, may enter into an agreement with the chief fiscal officer of
  the cities of New York, Yonkers or Mount Vernon to provide that a single
  return may be filed with a recording officer for  purposes  of  the  tax
  imposed under this article and the tax imposed by such city.
    (e)  Certifications.  The  making  or  filing  of  any return or other
  document or copy thereof, required to be made or filed pursuant to  this
  article, shall constitute a certification by the person making or filing
  such  return  or  other  document  or  copy  thereof that the statements
  contained therein are true and that any copy filed is a true copy.




   §  1410.  Payment.  (a) The tax imposed hereunder shall be paid to the
  commissioner, or to any agent of the commissioner appointed pursuant  to
  section  fourteen  hundred  seven  of  this  article,  no later than the
  fifteenth day  after  the  delivery  of  the  instrument  effecting  the
  conveyance  by the grantor to the grantee. For purposes of this article,
  the date of the instrument effecting the conveyance shall be presumed to
  be the date of delivery of such instrument. A notation shall be made (or
  stamps affixed) on the instrument effecting the conveyance  as  evidence
  of payment. The commissioner may provide for other methods of evidencing
  payment.  Except  as  hereafter  provided,  all  moneys received as such
  payments by the recording officer  or  any  agent  of  the  commissioner
  during each month, excluding the fees retained by such recording officer
  or  agent  pursuant to subdivision (c) of section fourteen hundred seven
  of this chapter, shall be remitted to the commissioner on the tenth  day
  of  the succeeding month or on such other day as is set by regulation by
  the commissioner. Provided, however,  if  the  total  of  such  payments
  required to be remitted to the commissioner by such recording officer or
  agent  during  the  prior calendar year exceeded one million two hundred
  thousand dollars, all moneys received as such payments by such recording
  officer or  agent  of  the  commissioner  from  the  first  through  and
  including  the  fifteenth day of a month, excluding the fees retained by
  such recording officer or agent pursuant to subdivision (c)  of  section
  fourteen  hundred  seven  of  this  chapter,  shall  be  remitted to the
  commissioner on the twenty-fifth day of the same month such  moneys  are
  received by such recording officer or agent. All moneys received as such
  payments  by  such recording officer or agent from the sixteenth through
  and including the last day of the month, excluding the fees retained  by
  such  recording  officer or agent pursuant to subdivision (c) of section
  fourteen hundred seven  of  this  chapter,  shall  be  remitted  to  the
  commissioner on the tenth day of the succeeding month.
    (b)  A  recording  officer  shall not record an instrument effecting a
  conveyance unless one of the following conditions is satisfied:
    (1)  the  instrument  is  accompanied  by  a  receipt  issued  by  the
  commissioner  pursuant  to  subdivision  (c) of section fourteen hundred
  twenty-three of this article; or
    (2) the return required by  section  fourteen  hundred  nine  of  this
  article  has  been  filed  and the real estate transfer tax due, if any,
  shall have been paid as provided in this section.




   § 1411. Determination of tax. (a) If a return required by this article
  is  not  filed,  or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient,
  the amount of tax  due  shall  be  determined  by  the  commissioner  of
  taxation  and  finance  from  such  records  or  information  as  may be
  obtainable, including the assessed valuation of  the  real  property  or
  interest   therein   and  other  appropriate  factors.  Notice  of  such
  determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the
  tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless
  the person against whom it is assessed, within  ninety  days  after  the
  giving  of  notice of such determination, shall petition the division of
  tax appeals for a hearing, or unless the commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance  of the commissioner's own motion shall redetermine the same. In
  any case before the division of tax  appeals  under  this  article,  the
  burden  of  proof  shall  be  on the petitioner. After such hearing, the
  division of tax appeals shall give notice of the  determination  of  the
  administrative  law judge to the person against whom the tax is assessed
  and the commissioner of taxation and finance. Such determination may  be
  reviewed  by  the  tax  appeals tribunal as provided in article forty of
  this chapter. The decision of the tax appeals tribunal may  be  reviewed
  as  provided  in  section  two  thousand  sixteen  of  this  chapter.  A
  proceeding for judicial review shall not be instituted unless:  (1)  the
  amount  of  any  tax  sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest
  thereon, if any, shall be  first  deposited  with  the  commissioner  of
  taxation  and  finance and there shall be filed with the commissioner of
  taxation  and  finance  an  undertaking,  issued  by  a  surety  company
  authorized  to  transact  business  in  this  state  and approved by the
  superintendent of financial services of this state as  to  solvency  and
  responsibility,  in  such  amount and with such sureties as a justice of
  the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if  such  proceeding
  be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and
  charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or (2) at
  the   option   of  the  petitioner,  such  undertaking  filed  with  the
  commissioner of taxation and finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover
  the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such decision,  plus
  the costs and charges which may accrue against him in the prosecution of
  the  proceeding,  in which event the petitioner shall not be required to
  deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition  precedent  to
  the commencement of the proceeding.
    (b)  A  person  liable for the tax imposed by this article (whether or
  not a determination assessing a tax pursuant to subdivision (a) of  this
  section has been issued) shall be entitled to have a tax due finally and
  irrevocably  fixed  prior  to  the  ninety-day  period  referred  to  in
  subdivision (a) of this section, by  filing  with  the  commissioner  of
  taxation  and  finance a signed statement in writing in such form as the
  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  shall  prescribe,   consenting
  thereto.




   § 1412. Refunds. (a) A grantor or grantee claiming to have erroneously
  paid  the tax imposed by this article or some other person designated by
  such grantor or grantee may file an application for  refund  within  two
  years from the date of payment. Such application shall be filed with the
  commissioner of taxation and finance on a form which he shall prescribe.
    (b)  The  commissioner  of taxation and finance may grant or deny such
  application in whole or in part and shall notify the applicant  by  mail
  accordingly.  Such  determination  shall be final and irrevocable unless
  the applicant shall, within ninety days after the mailing of  notice  of
  such  determination, petition the division of tax appeals for a hearing.
  After such hearing, the administrative law judge shall  mail  notice  of
  its  determination  to the applicant and to the commissioner of taxation
  and finance. Such determination may  be  reviewed  by  the  tax  appeals
  tribunal  as  provided in article forty of this chapter. The decision of
  the tax appeals tribunal may be reviewed  as  provided  in  section  two
  thousand sixteen of this chapter. A proceeding for judicial review shall
  not  be  instituted unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner
  of taxation and finance in such amount  and  with  such  sureties  as  a
  justice  of  the  supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such
  proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the  petitioner  will  pay
  all  costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  in the prosecution of such
  proceeding.
    (c) A person shall not be entitled to a refund under this section of a
  tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to
  the provisions of section fourteen hundred eleven of this article  where
  he  has  had  a  hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in
  said section, or has failed to avail himself  of  the  remedies  therein
  provided. However, a person filing with the commissioner of taxation and
  finance a signed statement in writing, as provided in subdivision (b) of
  section  fourteen hundred eleven of this article, before a determination
  assessing tax, pursuant to subdivision (a) of section  fourteen  hundred
  eleven,  is  issued,  shall,  nevertheless,  be  entitled to apply for a
  refund pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section, as long  as
  such  application  is  made within the time limitation set forth in such
  subdivision (a). No refund shall be made of a tax, interest  or  penalty
  paid  after  a determination by the commissioner of taxation and finance
  made pursuant to section fourteen hundred eleven unless it is found that
  such  determination  was  erroneous,  illegal  or  unconstitutional   or
  otherwise  improper  after  review by the tax appeals tribunal or of the
  commissioner of taxation and finance's own motion, or  in  a  proceeding
  under  article  seventy-eight  of  the  civil  practice  law  and rules,
  pursuant to the provisions of  section  two  thousand  sixteen  of  this
  chapter,  in  which  event  refund shall be made of the tax, interest or
  penalty found to have been overpaid.
    (d) Interest shall be allowed and paid upon any refund  made  pursuant
  to  this section except that no interest shall be allowed or paid if the
  amount thereof would be less than one dollar. Such interest shall be  at
  the overpayment rate set pursuant to section fourteen hundred sixteen of
  this  article  and shall have like application, or if no rate is set, at
  the rate of six per centum per annum from the date when the tax, penalty
  or interest refunded was paid to a date preceding the date of the refund
  check by not more than thirty days. Provided, however, for  purposes  of
  this  subdivision  any  tax  paid before the last day prescribed for its
  payment shall be deemed to have been paid on such last day.




   § 1413. Remedies exclusive. The remedies provided by sections fourteen
  hundred  eleven and fourteen hundred twelve of this article shall be the
  exclusive remedies available  to  any  person  for  the  review  of  tax
  liability   imposed  by  this  article.  No  determination  or  proposed
  determination of tax or determination  on  any  application  for  refund
  shall be enjoined or reviewed by any action for declaratory judgment, an
  action  for money had and received, or by any action or proceeding other
  than a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice  law
  and rules.




   § 1414. Proceedings to recover tax. (a) Whenever any person shall fail
  to  pay  any  tax,  penalty  or  interest  imposed  by this article, the
  attorney general shall, upon the request of the commissioner of taxation
  and finance, bring or cause to be  brought  an  action  to  enforce  the
  payment  of  the same on behalf of the state of New York in any court of
  the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States.
    (b) As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of taxation
  and finance may issue a warrant, directed to the sheriff of  any  county
  commanding  him  to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of
  any grantor or grantee liable for the tax, which may be found within his
  county, for the payment of the amount  thereof,  with  any  penalty  and
  interest,  and  the  cost  of  executing the warrant, and to return such
  warrant to the commissioner of taxation  and  finance  and  to  pay  the
  commissioner  the  money  collected  by virtue thereof within sixty days
  after the receipt of such warrant. The sheriff shall  within  five  days
  after  the  receipt  of  the  warrant  file with the county clerk a copy
  thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the
  name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of  the  tax,
  penalty  and  interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when
  such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of  such  warrant  so  docketed
  shall  become  a  lien  upon  the  title to and the interest in real and
  personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. Such
  lien shall not apply to personal property unless such warrant  is  filed
  in  the  department  of  state.  The sheriff shall then proceed upon the
  warrant, in the same manner, and with like effect, as that  provided  by
  law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a
  court  of  record  and for services in executing the warrant he shall be
  entitled to the same fees, which he may collect in the same manner.   In
  the  discretion of the commissioner of taxation and finance a warrant of
  like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to  any  officer
  or  employee  of  the division of taxation, and in the execution thereof
  such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon
  sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in  excess  of
  the  actual  expenses  paid  in  the performance of such duty. Upon such
  filing of a copy of a warrant, the commissioner of taxation and  finance
  shall  have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if
  the state had recovered the judgment therefor.




   §  1415.  General  powers of the commissioner of taxation and finance.
  The commissioner of taxation and finance shall have the  power:  (a)  to
  administer  and  enforce  the  tax  imposed  by  this  article  and  the
  commissioner is authorized to make such rules and  regulations,  and  to
  require  such  facts and information to be reported, as the commissioner
  may deem necessary to enforce the provisions of this article.
    (b) For the purposes of ascertaining the correctness of any return, or
  for the purpose of making an estimate of tax of any return, or  for  the
  purpose  of  making  an  estimate of tax of any person, to examine or to
  cause to have examined, by any agent or representative designated by the
  commissioner for that purpose, any books, papers, records  or  memoranda
  related  to  the  matters required to be included in the return, and may
  require the attendance of the person rendering the return or any officer
  or employee of such person, or the attendance of any other person having
  knowledge of the matters included in the return, and may take  testimony
  and require proof material for its information, with power to administer
  oaths to such person or persons.
    (c)  To  extend,  for cause shown, the time of filing any return for a
  period not exceeding three months.
    (d) To prescribe the methods for determining the consideration and net
  consideration attributable to that  portion  of  real  property  located
  partly  within and partly without the state of New York which is located
  within the state of New York or any interest therein.
    (e) To require any grantor or grantee to keep such  records,  and  for
  such  length of time as may be required for the proper administration of
  this title and to furnish such records to the commissioner  of  taxation
  and finance upon request.
    (f)  The  commissioner  of taxation and finance, of the commissioner's
  own motion, may abate any small unpaid balance of an assessment  of  the
  tax to be levied hereunder, or any liability in respect thereof, if such
  commissioner   determines   under   uniform   rules  prescribed  by  the
  commissioner that the administration and collection costs involved would
  not warrant collection of the amount  due.  The  commissioner  may  also
  abate,  of  the  commissioner's  own  motion,  the unpaid portion of the
  assessment of any tax or any liability  in  respect  thereof,  which  is
  excessive  in  amount, or is assessed after the expiration of the period
  of  limitation  properly  applicable  thereto,  or  is  erroneously   or
  illegally  assessed. No claim for abatement under this subdivision shall
  be filed by a taxpayer.




   §  1416.  Interest  and  civil  penalties.  (a) If the commissioner of
  taxation and finance determines that there has been  an  overpayment  of
  tax,  interest  at the overpayment rate set by the commissioner shall be
  paid by the comptroller to the grantor or grantee, on  any  refund  paid
  pursuant  to  the  provisions of section fourteen hundred twelve of this
  article.  If  the  commissioner  determines  that  there  has  been   an
  underpayment  of  tax,  the grantor or grantee shall pay interest to the
  commissioner at the underpayment rate set by  the  commissioner  on  the
  amount  of  any  tax  not  paid. The commissioner shall set the rates of
  interest to be paid on underpayment and overpayment of the taxes imposed
  by this article at the underpayment and overpayment  rates  of  interest
  prescribed  in subsection (e) of section one thousand ninety-six of this
  chapter.
    (b) Any grantor or grantee failing to file a return or to pay any  tax
  within  the  time required by this article shall be subject to a penalty
  of ten per centum of the amount of tax due plus an interest  penalty  of
  two  per  centum  of  such  amount  for  each month of delay or fraction
  thereof after the expiration of the first month after  such  return  was
  required to be filed or such tax became due, such interest penalty shall
  not  exceed twenty-five per centum in the aggregate. If the commissioner
  of taxation and finance determines that such failure or delay was due to
  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the commissioner  shall
  remit, abate or waive all of such penalty and such interest penalty.
    (c)  If  any  amount  of  tax  is  not paid on or before the last date
  prescribed in section fourteen hundred ten of this chapter for  payment,
  interest at the underpayment rate set by the commissioner on such amount
  shall  be  paid for the period from such last date to the date paid. The
  commissioner  shall  set  the  rate  of  interest  to  be  paid  at  the
  underpayment  rate  of  interest prescribed in subsection (e) of section
  one thousand ninety-six of this chapter. Interest under this subdivision
  shall not be paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar.
    (d) The penalties and interest provided for in this section  shall  be
  paid   to  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  and  shall  be
  determined, assessed, collected and distributed in the  same  manner  as
  the tax imposed by this article and any reference to tax in this article
  shall  be  deemed to refer to the penalties and interest imposed in this
  section.




   §  1417.  Criminal  penalties.  For  criminal  penalties,  see article
  thirty-seven of this chapter.




   §  1418.  Returns  to  be secret. (a) Except in accordance with proper
  judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for
  the tax appeals tribunal, the commissioner of taxation and finance,  any
  officer  or  employee  of  the  department  of taxation and finance, any
  person engaged or retained by such department on an independent contract
  basis, or any person who, pursuant to  this  section,  is  permitted  to
  inspect  any  return  or to whom a copy, an abstract or a portion of any
  return is furnished, or to whom any information contained in any  return
  is furnished, to divulge or make known in any manner the particulars set
  forth  or disclosed in any return required under this article. Provided,
  however, that nothing in this section shall prohibit a recording officer
  from making a notation, or affixing stamps, on an instrument effecting a
  conveyance indicating the amount of tax  paid.  No  recorded  instrument
  effecting a conveyance shall be considered a return for purposes of this
  section.
    (b) The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not be
  required  to  produce  any  of them or evidence of anything contained in
  them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf  of  the
  commissioner  of  taxation and finance in any action or proceeding under
  the provisions of this chapter or in  any  other  action  or  proceeding
  involving  the  collection  of a tax due under this chapter to which the
  state or the commissioner of taxation  and  finance  is  a  party  or  a
  claimant,  or  on  behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under
  the provisions of this article when the returns or facts  shown  thereby
  are  directly  involved  in  such  action or proceeding, in any of which
  events the court may  require  the  production  of,  and  may  admit  in
  evidence,  so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are
  pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section,
  the commissioner of taxation and finance may permit the secretary of the
  treasury of the United States  or  his  delegates,  or  the  proper  tax
  officer   of  any  city  imposing  a  similar  tax,  or  the  authorized
  representative of either such officer, to inspect any return filed under
  this  article,  or  may  furnish  to  such  officer  or  his  authorized
  representative  an  abstract  of  any  such  return  or  supply him with
  information  concerning  an  item  contained  in  any  such  return,  or
  disclosed  by any investigation of tax liability under this article, but
  such permission shall be granted or such information furnished  only  if
  the laws of the United States or of such city, as the case may be, grant
  substantially  similar  privileges  to  the commissioner of taxation and
  finance or officer of this state charged with the administration of  the
  tax  imposed by this article, and only if such information is to be used
  for tax purposes only; and provided further the commissioner of taxation
  and finance may furnish to the commissioner of internal revenue  or  his
  authorized  representative  such  returns  filed  under this article and
  other tax information, as he may  consider  proper,  for  use  in  court
  actions or proceedings under the internal revenue code, whether civil or
  criminal,  where  a  written  request  therefor  has  been  made  to the
  commissioner of taxation and finance by the secretary of the treasury of
  the United States or his delegates, provided  the  laws  of  the  United
  States  grant  substantially  similar  powers  to  the  secretary of the
  treasury of the United States or his delegates. Where  the  commissioner
  of  taxation  and finance has so authorized the use of returns and other
  information in such actions or proceedings, officers  and  employees  of
  the  department  of  taxation and finance may testify in such actions or
  proceedings in respect to such returns or other information.


   (d) The tax appeals tribunal shall, nevertheless, publish a copy or  a
  summary  of any decision rendered after the hearing required pursuant to
  this chapter.
    (e)  Nothing  herein  shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a
  grantor or grantee of an instrument effecting a conveyance or  the  duly
  authorized representative of a grantor or grantee of a certified copy of
  any  return  filed in connection with such instrument or to prohibit the
  publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification
  of particular returns and the items thereof, or the  inspection  by  the
  attorney  general  or  other  legal  representatives of the state of the
  return of any taxpayer who shall bring action to set aside or review the
  tax based thereon, or against whom an action or  proceeding  under  this
  chapter has been recommended by the commissioner of taxation and finance
  or the attorney general or has been instituted, or the inspection of the
  returns   required  under  this  article  by  the  comptroller  or  duly
  designated officer or employee of the  state  department  of  audit  and
  control,  for  purposes  of  the  audit of a refund of any tax paid by a
  taxpayer under this article.
    (f) Any officer or employee of the state who  willfully  violates  the
  provisions  of  this  section  shall  be  dismissed  from  office and be
  incapable of holding any public office in this state  for  a  period  of
  five years thereafter.
    (g)  Cross-reference. For criminal penalties, see article thirty-seven
  of this chapter.
    (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section,
  the commissioner may  furnish  information  relating  to  real  property
  transfers  obtained  or  derived  from  returns  filed  pursuant to this
  article in relation to the real estate transfer tax, to the extent  that
  such  information is also required to be reported to the commissioner by
  section three hundred thirty-three of the real property law and  section
  five  hundred  seventy-four  of  the real property tax law and the rules
  adopted thereunder, provided such information was  collected  through  a
  combined  process established pursuant to an agreement entered into with
  the commissioner pursuant to paragraph  viii  of  subdivision  one-e  of
  section  three  hundred  thirty-three  of  the  real  property  law. The
  commissioner may redisclose such information to the extent authorized by
  section five hundred seventy-four of the  real  property  tax  law.  The
  commissioner  may  also  disclose  any  information reported pursuant to
  paragraph two of subdivision (a) of section  fourteen  hundred  nine  of
  this article.
    (i)  (1)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of subdivision (a) of this
  section, upon written request from the chairperson of the  committee  on
  ways  and  means  of  the  United  States  House of Representatives, the
  chairperson of the committee on finance of the United States Senate,  or
  the  chairperson of the joint committee on taxation of the United States
  Congress, the commissioner shall furnish such committee with any current
  or prior year returns filed specified in such request  that  were  under
  this  article  by  the president of the United States, vice-president of
  the United States, member of the United States Congress representing New
  York state, or any person who served in or was employed by the executive
  branch of the government of the United States on the executive staff  of
  the president, in the executive office of the president, or in an acting
  or  confirmed  capacity  in  a  position  subject to confirmation by the
  United States senate;  or,  in  New  York  state:  a  statewide  elected
  official,  as  defined  in  paragraph  (a) of subdivision one of section
  seventy-three-a of the public officers law; a state officer or employee,
  as defined in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (c) of  subdivision  one  of
  such  section seventy-three-a; a political party chairperson, as defined


 in paragraph (h) of subdivision one of such section  seventy-three-a;  a
  local  elected  official,  as  defined  in  subdivisions  one and two of
  section eight hundred  ten  of  the  general  municipal  law;  a  person
  appointed,  pursuant to law, to serve due to vacancy or otherwise in the
  position of a local elected official, as defined in subdivisions one and
  two of section eight hundred ten of the general municipal law; a  member
  of  the  state  legislature;  or a judge or justice of the unified court
  system; or filed  by  a  partnership,  firm,  association,  corporation,
  joint-stock  company,  trust  or  similar  entity directly or indirectly
  controlled by any  individual  listed  in  this  paragraph,  whether  by
  contract,  through  ownership  or control of a majority interest in such
  entity, or otherwise, or filed  by  a  partnership,  firm,  association,
  corporation,  joint-stock  company, trust or similar entity of which any
  individual listed in this paragraph holds ten percent  or  more  of  the
  voting  securities  of  such  entity;  provided  however  that, prior to
  furnishing any return, the commissioner  shall  redact  any  copy  of  a
  federal return (or portion thereof) attached to, or any information on a
  federal  return  that  is  reflected  on,  such  return,  and any social
  security numbers, account numbers and residential address information.
    (2) No returns shall be furnished pursuant to this subdivision  unless
  the  chairperson  of  the requesting committee certifies in writing that
  such returns have been requested related to, and in  furtherance  of,  a
  legitimate  task of the Congress, that the requesting committee has made
  a written request to the United States secretary  of  the  treasury  for
  related  federal  returns  or  return information, pursuant to 26 U.S.C.
  Section 6103(f), and that if such requested  returns  are  inspected  by
  and/or  submitted  to  another  committee, to the United States House of
  Representatives, or to the United States Senate,  then  such  inspection
  and/or submission shall occur in a manner consistent with federal law as
  informed  by  the  requirements  and procedures established in 26 U.S.C.
  Section 6103(f).




   §  1419.  Notices.  (a)  Any  notice  authorized or required under the
  provisions of this article may be given  by  mailing  the  same  to  the
  person  for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope addressed to such
  person at the address given in the last return filed by him pursuant  to
  the  provisions  of  this article, in any application made by him, or in
  any instrument evidencing the conveyance which is  the  subject  of  the
  notice,  or,  if no return has been filed or application made or address
  stated in the instrument, then to such address as may be  obtainable.  A
  notice  of  determination  shall  be  mailed  promptly  by registered or
  certified mail.   The  mailing  of  such  notice  shall  be  presumptive
  evidence  of  the  receipt  of the same by the person to whom addressed.
  Any period of time which is determined according to  the  provisions  of
  this  title  by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date
  of mailing of such notice.
    (b) (1) If any return, claim, statement, notice, application, or other
  document required to be filed, or  any  payment  required  to  be  made,
  within  a  prescribed  period  or  on  or before a prescribed date under
  authority of any provision of this article is, after such period or such
  date, delivered by United States mail to the  commissioner  of  taxation
  and  finance,  bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom
  such document is required to be filed, or  to  which  or  to  whom  such
  payment  is  required to be made, the date of the United States postmark
  stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to  be  the  date  of  delivery.
  This  subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the
  prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing  of
  such  document,  or  for  making  the  payment,  including any extension
  granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment
  was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly  addressed  to  the
  commissioner  of taxation and finance, bureau, office, officer or person
  with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which
  or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is  sent
  by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie
  evidence  that  such  document  was  delivered  to  the  commissioner of
  taxation and finance, bureau, office, officer or person to which  or  to
  whom  addressed.  To  the  extent  that the commissioner of taxation and
  finance shall prescribe by regulation, certified mail  may  be  used  in
  lieu of registered mail under this section. This subdivision shall apply
  in  the case of postmarks not made by the United States post office only
  if and to the extent provided  by  regulation  of  the  commissioner  of
  taxation and finance.
    (2)(A)    Any  reference  in  paragraph one of this subdivision to the
  United States mail shall be treated as  including  a  reference  to  any
  delivery  service  designated  by  the  secretary of the treasury of the
  United States pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred  two  of  the
  internal  revenue  code  and  any  reference  in  paragraph  one of this
  subdivision  to a postmark by the United States mail shall be treated as
  including a reference to any date  recorded  or  marked  in  the  manner
  described  in  section  seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue
  code by a designated delivery service.  If the commissioner  finds  that
  any  delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the
  needs of the state, the commissioner may withdraw such  designation  for
  purposes   of  this  article.    The  commissioner  may  also  designate
  additional  delivery  services   meeting   the   criteria   of   section
  seventy-five  hundred  two  of the internal revenue code for purposes of
  this article, or may withdraw any such designation if he  finds  that  a
  delivery service so designated is inadequate for the needs of the state.
  Any  reference in paragraph one of this subdivision to the United States
  mail shall be treated as including a reference to any  delivery  service


 designated  by  the  commissioner  and any reference in paragraph one of
  this subdivision to a postmark  by  the  United  States  mail  shall  be
  treated  as  including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the
  manner  described  in  section  seventy-five hundred two of the internal
  revenue code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner.
    (B) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated  by  the
  United  States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the
  commissioner pursuant to the same criteria used by  such  secretary  for
  such  designation  pursuant  to  section seventy-five hundred two of the
  internal  revenue  code,  shall  be  included  within  the  meaning   of
  registered   or  certified  mail  as  used  in  paragraph  one  of  this
  subdivision.    If  the  commissioner  finds  that  any  equivalent   of
  registered  or  certified  mail  designated  by  such  secretary  or the
  commissioner is inadequate for the needs of the state, the  commissioner
  may withdraw such designation for purposes of this article.
    (c)  When  the  last  day  prescribed  under authority of this article
  (including any extension of  time)  for  performing  any  act  falls  on
  Saturday,  Sunday  or  a  legal  holiday  in  the state of New York, the
  performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on
  the next succeeding day which is not  a  Saturday,  Sunday  or  a  legal
  holiday.




   §  1420. Limitations of time. (a) The provisions of the civil practice
  law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time  for  the
  enforcement  of  a  civil  remedy  shall  not apply to any proceeding or
  action taken by the state or the commissioner of taxation and finance to
  levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of  any  tax
  or  penalty  provided  by  this article. No assessment of additional tax
  shall be made after the expiration of more than  three  years  from  the
  date  of the filing of a return; provided, however, that where no return
  has been filed as provided by law or in the case of a willfully false or
  fraudulent return, the tax may be assessed at any time.
    (b) Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed  herein  for
  the  assessment  of  additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing
  that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due  may
  be  determined  at  any  time within such extended period. The period so
  extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing  made
  before  the  expiration  of  the  extended  period.  If  a  taxpayer has
  consented in writing to the extension of the period for assessment,  the
  period  for  filing  an  application  for  a  refund pursuant to section
  fourteen hundred twelve shall not expire prior to six months  after  the
  expiration of the period within which an assessment may be made pursuant
  to the consent to extend the time for assessment of additional tax.




   §  1421.  Deposit  and  dispositions  of revenues. (a) From the taxes,
  interest and penalties attributable  to  the  tax  imposed  pursuant  to
  section  fourteen hundred two of this article, the amount of one hundred
  ninety-nine million three hundred thousand dollars shall be deposited by
  the  comptroller  in  the  environmental  protection  fund   established
  pursuant to section ninety-two-s of the state finance law for the fiscal
  year beginning April first, two thousand nine; the amount of one hundred
  nineteen million one hundred thousand dollars shall be deposited in such
  fund  for  the  fiscal year beginning April first, two thousand ten; the
  amount of two hundred fifty-seven million three hundred  fifty  thousand
  dollars  shall be deposited into such fund for the fiscal year beginning
  April  first,  two  thousand  twenty-two;  and  for  each  fiscal   year
  thereafter.  On or before June twelfth, nineteen hundred ninety-five and
  on or before the twelfth day of each  month  thereafter  (excepting  the
  first  and  second  months  of  each fiscal year), the comptroller shall
  deposit into such fund from the taxes, interest and penalties  collected
  pursuant to such section fourteen hundred two of this article which have
  been  deposited  and  remain  to  the comptroller's credit in the banks,
  banking houses or trust companies referred to  in  section  one  hundred
  seventy-one-a  of  this chapter at the close of business on the last day
  of the preceding month, an amount  equal  to  one-tenth  of  the  annual
  amount  required  to  be deposited in such fund pursuant to this section
  for the fiscal year in which such deposit is required to be made. In the
  event such amount of taxes, interest and penalties so remaining  to  the
  comptroller's credit is less than the amount required to be deposited in
  such  fund by the comptroller, an amount equal to the shortfall shall be
  deposited in such fund by the comptroller with subsequent  deposits,  as
  soon  as  the  revenue  is  available.  Beginning  April first, nineteen
  hundred ninety-seven, the comptroller  shall  transfer  monthly  to  the
  clean   water/clean   air   fund   established   pursuant   to   section
  ninety-seven-bbb of the state finance law,  all  moneys  remaining  from
  such  taxes,  interest and penalties collected that are not required for
  deposit in the environmental protection fund.
    (b) Notwithstanding  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section,  the  taxes,
  interest and penalties attributable to (i) the tax imposed under section
  fourteen  hundred two of this article at the rate specified in paragraph
  two of subdivision (a) of such section, and (ii) the tax  imposed  under
  section  fourteen  hundred  two-b  of  this  article,  and  collected or
  received  by  the  commissioner  shall  be  deposited  daily  with  such
  responsible  banks,  banking  houses  or  trust  companies,  as  may  be
  designated by the comptroller, to the credit of the comptroller in trust
  for  the  metropolitan  transportation  authority.  An  account  may  be
  established  in  one or more of such depositories. Such deposits will be
  kept separate and apart from all other money in the  possession  of  the
  comptroller.  The  comptroller  shall require adequate security from all
  such depositories.  Of the total revenue  collected  or  received  under
  this   article,   the  comptroller  shall  retain  such  amount  as  the
  commissioner may determine  to  be  necessary  for  refunds  under  this
  article.  On  or  before  the  twelfth  and  twenty-sixth  day  of  each
  succeeding month, after reserving such  amount  for  such  refunds,  the
  commissioner shall certify to the comptroller the amount of all revenues
  so  received  during  the prior month as a result of the taxes, interest
  and penalties so imposed. The amount of revenues so certified  shall  be
  paid over by the fifteenth and the final business day of each succeeding
  month  from such account without appropriation into the central business
  district tolling capital lockbox fund established  pursuant  to  section
  five  hundred  fifty-three-j  of  the  public authorities law, provided,
  however, that the comptroller shall ensure  that  any  payments  to  the


 central  business district tolling capital lockbox fund established that
  are due to be paid by the final business day in the  month  of  December
  pursuant  to  this subdivision shall be received by the central business
  district  tolling capital lockbox fund on the same business day in which
  it is paid.




   §  1422.  Foreclosure  proceedings. Where the conveyance consists of a
  transfer of property made as a result of an order  of  the  court  in  a
  foreclosure  proceeding  ordering the sale of such property, the referee
  or sheriff effectuating such  transfer  shall  not  be  liable  for  any
  interest  or  penalties  that are authorized pursuant to this article or
  article thirty-seven of this chapter.




   §  1423.  Modernization  of  real  property  transfer  reporting.  (a)
  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary,  the  commissioner
  is hereby authorized to implement a system for the electronic collection
  of data relating to transfers of real property. In connection therewith,
  the  commissioner may combine the two forms referred to in paragraph one
  of this subdivision into a consolidated real property transfer  form  to
  be filed with him or her electronically; provided:
    (1) The two forms that may be so combined are the real estate transfer
  tax  return  required  by section fourteen hundred nine of this article,
  and the real property transfer report required by subdivision  one-e  of
  section  three  hundred  thirty-three of the real property law. However,
  the commissioner shall continue to maintain both such  return  and  such
  report  as  separate  forms,  so  that a party who prefers not to file a
  consolidated  real  property  transfer  form   with   the   commissioner
  electronically shall have the option of filing both such return and such
  report  with  the recording officer, as otherwise provided by law. Under
  no circumstances shall a consolidated real  property  transfer  form  be
  filed with, or accepted by, the recording officer.
    (2)   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  section  fourteen  hundred
  eighteen of this article, any information appearing  on  a  consolidated
  real  property transfer form that is required to be included on the real
  property transfer report required by subdivision one-e of section  three
  hundred thirty-three of the real property law shall be subject to public
  disclosure.
    (3)  When a consolidated real property transfer form is electronically
  submitted to the department by either the grantor or grantee or  a  duly
  authorized  agent  thereof,  the  act  of  submitting such form shall be
  deemed to be the signing of the return as required by paragraph  (v)  of
  subdivision one-e of the real property law or subdivision (b) of section
  fourteen  hundred nine of this article, and the requirement that all the
  grantors and grantees shall sign the return shall  not  apply.  However,
  the  fact that a grantor or grantee has not electronically submitted the
  form shall not relieve that grantor or grantee of any liability for  the
  tax imposed by this article.
    (b)  When a consolidated real property transfer form is filed with the
  commissioner electronically pursuant to this section,  the  real  estate
  transfer  tax  imposed  under  this  article,  and  the  fee  that would
  otherwise be retained by the recording officer pursuant  to  subdivision
  three  of  section  three hundred thirty-three of the real property law,
  shall be paid to the  commissioner  therewith.  The  commissioner  shall
  retain  on  behalf of the recording officer the portion of such tax that
  would otherwise have been retained by the recording officer pursuant  to
  subdivision  (c)  of section fourteen hundred seven of this article, and
  the portion of such fee that would otherwise have been retained  by  the
  recording officer pursuant to subdivision three of section three hundred
  thirty-three  of  the  real  property law. The moneys so retained by the
  commissioner on behalf of the recording officer, hereinafter referred to
  as the recording officer's fees, shall  be  deposited  daily  with  such
  responsible  banks,  banking  houses,  or  trust  companies  as  may  be
  designated by the state comptroller. Of the recording officer's fees  so
  deposited,  the comptroller shall retain in the comptroller's hands such
  amount as the commissioner may determine to be necessary for refunds  or
  reimbursements  of  such  fees  collected  or  received pursuant to this
  section,  out  of  which  the  comptroller  shall  pay  any  refunds  or
  reimbursements of such fees to which persons shall be entitled under the
  provisions of this section. The comptroller, after reserving such refund
  and  reimbursement  fund  shall,  on  or  before the twelfth day of each
  month, pay to the appropriate recording officers an amount equal to  the


 recording  officer's  fees  reserved on their behalf. Provided, however,
  that the commissioner is authorized  to  request  that  the  comptroller
  refrain  from  making such a payment of such fees to a recording officer
  until  the  commissioner  has  certified  to  the  comptroller  that the
  recording officer has supplied the commissioner with the liber and  page
  numbers of the recorded instruments that gave rise to such fees.
    (c)  The  system  for  the  electronic submission of consolidated real
  property transfer forms shall be designed so that  upon  the  successful
  electronic filing of such a form and the payment of the associated taxes
  and  fees,  the  party  submitting  the  same  shall be provided with an
  electronic receipt  in  a  form  prescribed  by  the  commissioner  that
  confirms  such filing and payment. Such party may file a printed copy of
  such receipt with the recording officer  when  offering  the  associated
  instrument for recording, in lieu of submitting to the recording officer
  the  return, report, tax and fee that would otherwise have been required
  under this article and subdivisions one-e and  three  of  section  three
  hundred  thirty-three  of  the  real property law. The recording officer
  shall retain such receipt for a minimum of three years, unless otherwise
  directed by the commissioner, and shall provide a copy  thereof  to  the
  commissioner for inspection upon his or her request.
    (d)  Upon  recording  the  instrument  to  which the consolidated real
  property transfer form pertains, the recording officer shall provide the
  commissioner with the liber and page thereof at such time  and  in  such
  manner as the commissioner shall prescribe.
    (e)  The  provisions  of this section shall not be applicable within a
  city or county that has implemented its own electronic  system  for  the
  recording  of  deeds, the filing of the real estate transfer tax returns
  and the real property transfer reports prescribed by  the  commissioner,
  and  the  payment  of the associated taxes and fees, unless such city or
  county shall notify the commissioner that such jurisdiction will  follow
  the  system  authorized  pursuant to this section to be used therein, in
  writing.

	   § 1425. Imposition of tax. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law
  to   the  contrary,  the  county  of  Erie,  acting  through  its  local
  legislative body, is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt and  amend
  local  laws  imposing  in  such  county a tax on each conveyance of real
  property or interest therein when the consideration exceeds five hundred
  dollars, at the rate of two  dollars  and  fifty  cents  for  each  five
  hundred dollars or fractional part thereof; provided, however, that with
  respect  to  (A) a conveyance of a one, two or three-family house and an
  individual residential condominium unit, or interests therein;  and  (B)
  conveyances  where  the consideration is less than five hundred thousand
  dollars, the consideration for the interest conveyed shall  exclude  the
  value  of  any  lien  or  encumbrance  remaining  thereon at the time of
  conveyance. Such local law shall apply to any conveyance occurring on or
  after June first, nineteen  hundred  ninety,  but  shall  not  apply  to
  conveyances  made  on  or  after  such  date pursuant to binding written
  contracts entered into prior to such date, provided  that  the  date  of
  execution  of such contract is confirmed by independent evidence such as
  the recording of the contract, payment of a deposit or other  facts  and
  circumstances as determined by the treasurer.




   §  1426.  Payment  of  tax.  1.  The  real estate transfer tax imposed
  pursuant to this article shall be paid to the treasurer or the recording
  officer acting as the agent of the treasurer upon  designation  as  such
  agent  by  the treasurer. Such tax shall be paid at the same time as the
  real estate transfer tax imposed by article thirty-one of  this  chapter
  is  required  to  be  paid.  Such  treasurer  or recording officer shall
  endorse upon each deed or instrument effecting a  conveyance  a  receipt
  for the amount of the tax so paid.
    2.  A  return  shall  be  required  to be filed with such treasurer or
  recording officer for purposes of the real estate transfer  tax  imposed
  pursuant  to this article at the same time as a return is required to be
  filed for purposes of the real estate transfer tax  imposed  by  article
  thirty-one  of this chapter. The return, for purposes of the real estate
  transfer tax imposed pursuant to this article, shall be a  photocopy  or
  carbon  copy of the real estate transfer tax return required to be filed
  pursuant to section fourteen hundred nine of  this  chapter.    However,
  when  an  apportionment  is  required  to  be  made  pursuant to section
  fourteen hundred thirty-four of this article, a supplemental form  shall
  also  be  required to be filed. The real estate transfer tax returns and
  supplemental forms required to be filed pursuant to this  section  shall
  be  preserved  for  three  years  and thereafter until such treasurer or
  recording officer orders them to be destroyed.
    3. The recording officer shall not record an  instrument  effecting  a
  conveyance unless the return required by this section has been filed and
  the  tax  imposed  pursuant  to  this  article  shall  have been paid as
  provided in this section.




   §  1427.  Liability for tax.  1. The real estate transfer tax shall be
  paid by the grantor. If the grantor has failed to pay  the  tax  imposed
  pursuant  to this article or if the grantor is exempt from such tax, the
  grantee shall have the duty to pay the tax. Where the  grantee  has  the
  duty  to  pay  the  tax  because the grantor has failed to pay, such tax
  shall be the joint and several liability of the grantor and the grantee.
    2. For the purpose of the proper administration of this article and to
  prevent evasion of the tax hereby authorized, it shall be presumed  that
  all  conveyances are taxable.  Where the consideration includes property
  other than money, it shall be presumed that  the  consideration  is  the
  fair  market  value  of  the  real  property  or interest therein. These
  presumptions shall prevail until the contrary is proven, and the  burden
  of proving the contrary shall be on the person liable for payment of the
  tax.




   §  1428.  Exemptions. 1. The following shall be exempt from payment of
  the real estate transfer tax:
    (a) The state of New York, or any of its agencies,  instrumentalities,
  political  subdivisions,  or  public  corporations  (including  a public
  corporation created pursuant to agreement or compact with another  state
  or the Dominion of Canada).
    (b)  The  United  Nations, the United States of America and any of its
  agencies and instrumentalities.
    The exemption of  such  governmental  bodies  or  persons  shall  not,
  however, relieve a grantee from them of liability for the tax.
    2. The tax shall not apply to any of the following conveyances:
    (a)  Conveyances  to the United Nations, the United States of America,
  the state of New York, or any of their  instrumentalities,  agencies  or
  political  subdivisions  (or  any public corporation, including a public
  corporation created pursuant to agreement or compact with another  state
  or the Dominion of Canada);
    (b)  Conveyances  which  are  or  were  used to secure a debt or other
  obligation;
    (c) Conveyances  which,  without  additional  consideration,  confirm,
  correct, modify or supplement a prior conveyance;
    (d)  Conveyances  of real property without consideration and otherwise
  than in connection with a sale, including conveyances  conveying  realty
  as bona fide gifts;
    (e) Conveyances given in connection with a tax sale;
    (f)  Conveyances  to  effectuate  a mere change of identity or form of
  ownership or  organization  where  there  is  no  change  in  beneficial
  ownership,  other  than conveyances to a cooperative housing corporation
  of the real property comprising the cooperative dwelling or dwellings;
    (g) Conveyances which consist of a deed of partition;
    (h) Conveyances given pursuant to the federal bankruptcy act;
    (i) Conveyances of real property owned and  occupied  as  a  principal
  residence  by  one  or  more  persons, at least one of whom is sixty-two
  years of age or over, provided that such property  was  both  owned  and
  occupied  by  at  least one of such persons for a period of at least one
  year prior to the date of  transfer,  and  further  provided  that  such
  exemption  shall  be  limited  to  transfers  of  residential properties
  consisting of one or two dwelling units;
    (j) Conveyances of real property which consist of the execution  of  a
  contract  to  sell  real  property  without the use or occupancy of such
  property or the granting of an option to purchase real property  without
  the use or occupancy of such property; and
    (k)  Conveyances  of  an  option or contract to purchase real property
  with the use or occupancy of such property where  the  consideration  is
  less than two hundred thousand dollars and such property was used solely
  by  the  grantor as his personal residence and consists of a one, two or
  three-family house, an individual residential condominium  unit  or  the
  sale  of  stock  in a cooperative housing corporation in connection with
  the grant or transfer of a proprietary leasehold covering an  individual
  residential cooperative unit.




   §  1428-a.  Credit. 1. A grantor shall be allowed a credit against the
  tax due on a conveyance of real property to the extent tax was  paid  by
  such  grantor  on a prior creation of a leasehold of all or a portion of
  the same real property or on the granting of an option  or  contract  to
  purchase  all  or  a portion of the same real property, by such grantor.
  Such credit shall be  computed  by  multiplying  the  tax  paid  on  the
  creation  of  the leasehold or on the granting of the option or contract
  by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the  consideration
  used  to  compute  such tax paid which is not yet due to such grantor on
  the date of the subsequent conveyance (and which such grantor  will  not
  be entitled to receive after such date), and the denominator of which is
  the total value of the consideration used to compute such tax paid.
    2.  A  grantor  shall  be  allowed  a  credit against the tax due on a
  conveyance of real property under the following circumstances:  (a)  the
  grantor purchased the property without its being improved by residential
  premises, (b) the grantor improved it by the construction of residential
  premises  thereon,  and  (c) the grantor subsequently sold such improved
  property. At the time of the first sale of the property after the making
  of the improvement, the grantor shall be allowed a credit equal  to  the
  amount  of  the tax actually paid on the conveyance immediately prior to
  the making of the improvement.




   §    1428-b.    Cooperative    housing   corporation   transfers.   1.
  Notwithstanding the definition of "controlling  interest"  contained  in
  subdivision  two of section fourteen hundred twenty-four of this article
  or anything to the contrary contained in  subdivision  five  of  section
  fourteen  hundred  twenty-four of this article, the tax imposed pursuant
  to this article shall apply to (a) the original conveyance of shares  of
  stock  in a cooperative housing corporation in connection with the grant
  or transfer of a proprietary leasehold by the cooperative corporation or
  cooperative plan sponsor, and (b)  the  subsequent  conveyance  of  such
  stock  in a cooperative housing corporation in connection with the grant
  or transfer of a  proprietary  leasehold  by  the  owner  thereof.  With
  respect  to  any  such  subsequent  conveyance  where the property is an
  individual residential unit, the consideration for the interest conveyed
  shall exclude the value of any liens on certificates of stock  or  other
  evidences  of  an  ownership  interest in and a proprietary lease from a
  corporation  or  partnership  formed  for  the  purpose  of  cooperative
  ownership  of  residential  interest in real estate remaining thereon at
  the time of conveyance. In determining the tax on a conveyance described
  in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, a credit shall be  allowed  for  a
  proportionate  part of the amount of any tax paid upon the conveyance to
  the cooperative housing corporation of the real property comprising  the
  cooperative  dwelling  or  dwellings  to the extent that such conveyance
  effectuated a mere change of identity  or  form  of  ownership  of  such
  property  and not a change in the beneficial ownership of such property.
  The amount of the credit shall be determined by multiplying  the  amount
  of  tax  paid upon the conveyance to the cooperative housing corporation
  by a  percentage  representing  the  extent  to  which  such  conveyance
  effectuated  a  mere  change  of identity or form of ownership and not a
  change  in  the  beneficial  ownership  of  such  property,   and   then
  multiplying  the resulting product by a fraction, the numerator of which
  shall be the number  of  shares  of  stock  conveyed  in  a  transaction
  described  in  paragraph  (a) of this subdivision and the denominator of
  which shall be the total number of shares of stock  of  the  cooperative
  housing  corporation  (including any stock held by the corporation).  In
  no event, however, shall such credit reduce the  tax,  on  a  conveyance
  described  in  paragraph  (a) of this subdivision, below zero, nor shall
  any such credit be allowed for a tax paid more than  twenty-four  months
  prior  to  the date on which occurs the first in a series of conveyances
  of shares of stock in an offering  of  cooperative  housing  corporation
  shares described in paragraph (a) of this subdivision.
    2.  Every cooperative housing corporation shall be required to file an
  information return with the treasurer by July  fifteenth  of  each  year
  covering the preceding period of January first through June thirty-first
  and  by  January fifteenth of each year covering the preceding period of
  July first through December thirty-first. The return shall contain  such
  information   regarding  the  conveyance  of  shares  of  stock  in  the
  cooperative housing corporation as the  treasurer  may  deem  necessary,
  including  but  not  limited  to,  the  names,  addresses  and  employee
  identification numbers or social security numbers of the grantor and the
  grantee, the number of shares conveyed, the date of the  conveyance  and
  the consideration paid for such conveyance.




   §  1429.  Designation  of  agents.  The  treasurer  is  authorized  to
  designate the recording officer to act as  its  agent  for  purposes  of
  collecting  the  tax  authorized  by  this  article. The treasurer shall
  provide for the manner in which such person may  be  designated  as  its
  agent  subject  to  such terms and conditions as it shall prescribe. The
  real estate transfer tax shall be paid to  such  agent  as  provided  in
  section fourteen hundred twenty-six of this article.




   §  1430. Liability of recording officer. A recording officer shall not
  be liable for any inaccuracy in the amount of tax  imposed  pursuant  to
  this  article  that  he  shall  collect  so long as he shall compute and
  collect such tax on the amount of consideration  or  the  value  of  the
  interest  conveyed  as  such  amounts  are provided to him by the person
  paying the tax.




   §  1431.  Refunds.  Whenever  the  treasurer  shall determine that any
  moneys received under the provisions of the local law  enacted  pursuant
  to  this  article  were  paid  in  error, it may cause such moneys to be
  refunded pursuant to  such  rules  and  regulations  it  may  prescribe,
  provided  any  application  for  such refund is filed with the treasurer
  within two years from the date the erroneous payment was made.




   § 1432. Deposit and disposition of revenue. 1. (a) All taxes collected
  or  received  by  the  treasurer  or his duly authorized agent under the
  provisions of the local law enacted pursuant to this  article  shall  be
  deposited  in  accordance  with provisions of a local law adopted by the
  legislative body of Erie county which local law shall  designate  proper
  officers  to be responsible for deposit of revenue collected or received
  under this article. Such local law shall also provide that  any  officer
  designated to collect, receive, or deposit such revenue shall maintain a
  system  of  accounts  showing the revenue collected or received from the
  tax imposed pursuant to this article. Such local law shall also  provide
  that  an  officer  of  the  county  shall  pay  to  the Niagara Frontier
  transportation authority all revenue deposited under this section.  Such
  payment shall be made on the tenth day of each month for  the  preceding
  month.
    (b)   Distributions   made  to  the  Niagara  Frontier  transportation
  authority shall be used  only  for  operations  of  mass  transportation
  services  provided  by  the  Niagara  Frontier  transportation authority
  within the county of Erie. All  such  distributions  shall  be  made  in
  accordance  with the provisions of a contract between the county of Erie
  and the Niagara Frontier Transit Metro System, Inc.  Such  contract  may
  only  be  amended with the consent of the Niagara Frontier Transit Metro
  System, Inc. and when authorized by at least a two-thirds  vote  of  the
  county legislature.
    2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one of this section,
  on and after the first day  of  April,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-three,
  distributions  shall  be  paid into a repair reserve fund established by
  the county pursuant to section six-d of the general  municipal  law  for
  the purpose of repair of county roads and bridges within such county.




   §  1433.  Judicial review. 1. Any final determination of the amount of
  any tax payable  under  section  fourteen  hundred  twenty-six  of  this
  article shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality
  or   any   other   reason  whatsoever  by  a  proceeding  under  article
  seventy-eight of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules  if  application
  therefor  is  made  to  the  supreme  court within four months after the
  giving of the notice of such  final  determination,  provided,  however,
  that  any  such  proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil
  practice law and rules shall not be instituted unless (a) the amount  of
  any  tax sought to be reviewed, with such interest and penalties thereon
  as may be provided for by local law shall be first deposited  and  there
  is  filed  an  undertaking,  issued  by  a  surety company authorized to
  transact business in this state and approved by  the  superintendent  of
  financial  services  of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in
  such amount as a justice of the  supreme  court  shall  approve  to  the
  effect  that  if  such  proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed the
  petitioner will pay all costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  in  the
  prosecution  of  such proceeding or (b) at the option of the petitioner,
  such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, interest
  and penalties stated in such determination, plus the costs  and  charges
  which  may  accrue  against  it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in
  which event the petitioner shall not be  required  to  pay  such  taxes,
  interest or penalties as a condition precedent to the application.
    2.  Where  any  tax  imposed  hereunder  shall  have been erroneously,
  illegally or unconstitutionally assessed or  collected  and  application
  for  the  refund  or  revision  thereof  duly  made to the proper fiscal
  officer or officers, and such officer or  officers  shall  have  made  a
  determination  denying such refund or revision, such determination shall
  be reviewable by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of  the  civil
  practice  law  and rules, provided, however, (i) that such proceeding is
  instituted within four months after the giving of  the  notice  of  such
  denial,  (ii)  that  a final determination of tax due was not previously
  made, and (iii) that an undertaking is  filed  with  the  proper  fiscal
  officer  or  officers in such amount and with such sureties as a justice
  of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding
  be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and
  charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.




   §  1434.  Apportionment. The local law adopted by the legislative body
  of  Erie  county  shall  provide  for  a  method  of  apportionment  for
  determining the amount of tax due whenever the real property or interest
  therein is situated within and without Erie county.




   §  1435.  Miscellaneous. The local law adopted by the legislative body
  of Erie county may contain such other  provisions  as  such  legislative
  body  deems  necessary  for the proper administration of the tax imposed
  pursuant  to  this  article,   including   provisions   concerning   the
  determination  of  tax,  the imposition of interest on underpayments and
  overpayments and the imposition of civil  penalties.    Such  provisions
  shall  be  identical  to the corresponding provisions of the real estate
  transfer tax imposed by article thirty-one of this chapter,  so  far  as
  such  provisions  can  be made applicable to the tax imposed pursuant to
  this article.

  judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for
  the treasurer or any officer or employee of Erie County  or  any  person
  engaged  or  retained by such county on an independent contract basis to
  divulge or make known  in  any  manner  the  particulars  set  forth  or
  disclosed  in  any return required under a local law enacted pursuant to
  this article. Provided, however, that  nothing  in  this  section  shall
  prohibit  the  recording officer from making a notation on an instrument
  effecting a conveyance indicating the amount of tax  paid.  No  recorded
  instrument  effecting  a  conveyance  shall  be  considered a return for
  purposes of this section.
    (b) The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not be
  required to produce any of them or evidence  of  anything  contained  in
  them  in  any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the
  county in any action or proceeding involving the collection of a tax due
  under a local law enacted pursuant to this article to which such  county
  or an officer or employee of such county is a party or a claimant, or on
  behalf  of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of
  a local law enacted pursuant to this article when the returns  or  facts
  shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in any
  of  which  events the court may require the production of, and may admit
  in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown  thereby,  as
  are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more.
    (c)  Nothing  herein  shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a
  grantor or grantee of an instrument effecting a conveyance or  the  duly
  authorized representative of a grantor or grantee of a certified copy of
  any  return  filed in connection with such instrument or to prohibit the
  publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification
  of particular returns and the items thereof, or the  inspection  by  the
  legal  representatives  of such county of the return of any taxpayer who
  shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon.
    (d) Any officer or employee of such county who willfully violates  the
  provisions  of  this  section  shall  be  dismissed  from  office and be
  incapable of holding any public office in this state  for  a  period  of
  five years thereafter.

   * § 1438-b. Imposition of tax. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
  law  to  the  contrary,  the  town  of Red Hook, acting through its town
  board, is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt a local law  imposing
  in  such  town  a  tax  on  each conveyance of real property or interest
  therein not to exceed a maximum of two percent of the consideration  for
  such conveyance, subject to the exemptions set forth in section fourteen
  hundred thirty-eight-e of this article; any such local law shall fix the
  rate  of  such  tax.  Provided,  however,  any  such local law imposing,
  repealing or reimposing  such  tax  shall  be  subject  to  a  mandatory
  referendum  pursuant  to section twenty-three of the municipal home rule
  law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to adoption of such local law,
  the town must  establish  a  community  preservation  fund  pursuant  to
  section  sixty-four-h  of  the town law. Revenues from such tax shall be
  deposited in such fund and may be used solely for the purposes  of  such
  fund. Such local law shall apply to any conveyance occurring on or after
  the  first  day of a month to be designated by such town board, which is
  not less than sixty days after the enactment  of  such  local  law,  but
  shall  not  apply  to conveyances made on or after such date pursuant to
  binding written contracts entered into prior to such date, provided that

	   * §  1438-c.  Payment  of tax. 1. The real estate transfer tax imposed
  pursuant to this article shall be paid to the treasurer or the recording
  officer acting as the agent of the treasurer upon  designation  as  such
  agent  by  the treasurer. Such tax shall be paid at the same time as the
  real estate transfer tax imposed by article thirty-one of  this  chapter
  is  required  to  be  paid.  Such  treasurer  or recording officer shall
  endorse upon each deed or instrument effecting a  conveyance  a  receipt
  for the amount of the tax so paid.
    2.  A  return  shall  be  required  to be filed with such treasurer or
  recording officer for purposes of the real estate transfer  tax  imposed
  pursuant  to this article at the same time as a return is required to be
  filed for purposes of the real estate transfer tax  imposed  by  article
  thirty-one  of  this  chapter. The treasurer shall prescribe the form of
  return, the information which it shall contain,  and  the  documentation
  that  shall  accompany  the  return. Said form shall be identical to the
  real estate transfer tax return required to be filed pursuant to section
  fourteen hundred nine of this chapter, except that the  treasurer  shall
  adapt  said  form  to  reflect  the  provisions in this chapter that are
  inconsistent, different, or in addition to  the  provisions  of  article
  thirty-one  of  this  chapter.  The  real  estate  transfer  tax returns
  required to be filed pursuant to this section  shall  be  preserved  for
  three  years  and  thereafter  until such treasurer or recording officer
  orders them to be destroyed.
    3. The recording officer shall not record an  instrument  effecting  a
  conveyance unless the return required by this section has been filed and
  the  tax  imposed  pursuant  to  this  article  shall  have been paid as
  required in this section.

   * §  1438-d.  Liability for tax. 1. The real estate transfer tax shall
  be paid by the grantee. If the grantee has failed to pay the tax imposed
  pursuant to this article or if the grantee is exempt from such tax,  the
  grantor  shall  have  the duty to pay the tax. Where the grantor has the
  duty to pay the tax because the grantee has failed to pay the tax,  such
  tax  shall  be  the  joint  and several liability of the grantee and the
  grantor.
    2. For the purpose of the proper administration of this article and to
  prevent evasion of the tax hereby imposed, it shall be presumed that all
  conveyances are subject to the tax.  Where  the  consideration  includes
  property  other  than money, it shall be presumed that the consideration
  is the fair market value of the real property or interest therein. These
  presumptions shall prevail until the contrary is proven, and the  burden
  of proving the contrary shall be on the person liable for payment of the
  tax.

  Notwithstanding the definition of "controlling  interest"  contained  in
  subdivision  two  of  section  fourteen  hundred  thirty-eight-a of this
  article or anything to the contrary contained  in  subdivision  five  of
  section fourteen hundred thirty-eight-a of this article, the tax imposed
  pursuant  to  this article shall apply to (a) the original conveyance of
  shares of stock in a cooperative housing corporation in connection  with
  the  grant  or  transfer  of  a proprietary leasehold by the cooperative
  corporation  or  cooperative  plan  sponsor,  and  (b)  the   subsequent
  conveyance  of  such  stock  in  a  cooperative  housing  corporation in
  connection with the grant or transfer of a proprietary leasehold by  the
  owner  thereof. With respect to any such subsequent conveyance where the
  property is an individual residential unit, the  consideration  for  the
  interest  conveyed  shall exclude the value of any liens on certificates
  of  stock  or  other  evidences  of  an  ownership  interest  in  and  a
  proprietary  lease  from  a  corporation  or  partnership formed for the
  purpose of cooperative ownership of residential interest in real  estate
  remaining thereon at the time of conveyance. In determining the tax on a

  shall be allowed for a proportionate part of the amount of any tax  paid
  upon  the  conveyance to the cooperative housing corporation of the real
  property comprising the cooperative dwelling or dwellings to the  extent
  that  such  conveyance  effectuated a mere change of identity or form of
  ownership of such property and not a change in the beneficial  ownership
  of  such  property.  The  amount  of  the  credit shall be determined by
  multiplying  the  amount  of  tax  paid  upon  the  conveyance  to   the
  cooperative  housing corporation by a percentage representing the extent
  to which such conveyance effectuated a mere change of identity  or  form
  of  ownership  and  not  a  change  in  the beneficial ownership of such
  property, and then multiplying the resulting product by a fraction,  the
  numerator  of which shall be the number of shares of stock conveyed in a
  transaction described in paragraph (a)  of  this  subdivision,  and  the
  denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of stock of the
  cooperative  housing  corporation  (including  any  stock  held  by  the
  corporation). In no event, however, shall such credit reduce the tax, on
  a conveyance described in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, below zero,
  nor shall  any  such  credit  be  allowed  for  a  tax  paid  more  than
  twenty-four  months  prior  to  the  date on which occurs the first in a
  series of conveyances of shares of stock in an offering  of  cooperative
  housing   corporation   shares   described  in  paragraph  (a)  of  this

  covering the preceding period of January first  through  June  thirtieth
  and  by  January fifteenth of each year covering the preceding period of
  July first through December thirty-first. The return shall contain  such
  information   regarding  the  conveyance  of  shares  of  stock  in  the
  cooperative housing corporation as the  treasurer  may  deem  necessary,
  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  names,  addresses  and employee

  or by adding the amount of any  such  underpayment  to  such  number  of
  subsequent   payments  and  distributions  as  the  treasurer  and  town
  supervisor shall consider reasonable  in  view  of  the  overpayment  or

  article or anything to the contrary contained  in  subdivision  five  of
  section  fourteen hundred thirty-nine-a of this article, the tax imposed

  shares  of stock in a cooperative housing corporation in connection with
  the grant or transfer of a  proprietary  leasehold  by  the  cooperative
  corporation   or  cooperative  plan  sponsor,  and  (b)  the  subsequent
  conveyance of  such  stock  in  a  cooperative  housing  corporation  in

  property  is  an  individual residential unit, the consideration for the
  interest conveyed shall exclude the value of any liens  on  certificates
  of  stock  or  other  evidences  of  an  ownership  interest  in  and  a
  proprietary lease from a  corporation  or  partnership  formed  for  the
  purpose  of cooperative ownership of residential interest in real estate
  remaining thereon at the time of conveyance. In determining the tax on a
  conveyance described in paragraph (a)  of  this  subdivision,  a  credit
  shall  be allowed for a proportionate part of the amount of any tax paid
  upon the conveyance to the cooperative housing corporation of  the  real
  property  comprising the cooperative dwelling or dwellings to the extent
  that such conveyance effectuated a mere change of identity  or  form  of
  ownership  of such property and not a change in the beneficial ownership
  of such property. The amount  of  the  credit  shall  be  determined  by
  multiplying   the  amount  of  tax  paid  upon  the  conveyance  to  the
  cooperative housing corporation by a percentage representing the  extent
  to  which  such conveyance effectuated a mere change of identity or form
  of ownership and not a  change  in  the  beneficial  ownership  of  such
  property,  and then multiplying the resulting product by a fraction, the
  numerator of which shall be the number of shares of stock conveyed in  a
  transaction  described  in  paragraph  (a)  of  this subdivision and the
  denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of stock of the
  cooperative  housing  corporation  (including  any  stock  held  by  the
  corporation). In no event, however, shall such credit reduce the tax, on
  a conveyance described in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, below zero,
  nor  shall  any  such  credit  be  allowed  for  a  tax  paid  more than
  twenty-four months prior to the date on which  occurs  the  first  in  a
  series  of  conveyances of shares of stock in an offering of cooperative
  housing  corporation  shares  described  in  paragraph   (a)   of   this
  subdivision.

  covering  the  preceding  period of January first through June thirtieth
  and by January fifteenth of each year covering the preceding  period  of
  July  first through December thirty-first. The return shall contain such

  property  comprising the cooperative dwelling or dwellings to the extent
  that such conveyance effectuated a mere change of identity  or  form  of
  ownership  of such property and not a change in the beneficial ownership
  of such property. The amount  of  the  credit  shall  be  determined  by
  multiplying   the  amount  of  tax  paid  upon  the  conveyance  to  the
  cooperative housing corporation by a percentage representing the  extent
