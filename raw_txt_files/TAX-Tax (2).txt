§  210-B.  Credits.  1.  Investment tax credit (ITC).   (a) A taxpayer
  shall be allowed a credit,  to  be  computed  as  hereinafter  provided,
  against  the tax imposed by this article. The amount of the credit shall
  be the percent provided for hereinbelow of the investment  credit  base.
  The investment credit base is the cost or other basis for federal income
  tax  purposes of tangible personal property and other tangible property,
  including buildings and structural components of buildings, described in
  paragraph (b) of this subdivision, less the amount of  the  nonqualified
  nonrecourse  financing  with respect to such property to the extent such
  financing would be excludible from the credit base pursuant  to  section
  46(c)(8) of the internal revenue code (treating such property as section
  thirty-eight  property  irrespective  of  whether  or  not  it  in  fact
  constitutes section thirty-eight  property).  If,  at  the  close  of  a
  taxable  year  following  the  taxable  year  in which such property was
  placed in service, there is a net decrease in the amount of nonqualified
  nonrecourse financing with respect to such property, such  net  decrease
  shall  be  treated  as  if  it  were the cost or other basis of property
  described in paragraph (b) of this  subdivision  acquired,  constructed,
  reconstructed  or  erected during the year of the decrease in the amount
  of nonqualified nonrecourse financing. In the case of a combined  report
  the  term  investment  credit  base shall mean the sum of the investment
  credit base of each corporation included on such report. The  percentage
  to  be  used  to compute the credit allowed pursuant to this subdivision
  shall be five percent with respect to  the  first  three  hundred  fifty
  million  dollars  of  the  investment credit base, and four percent with
  respect to the investment credit base in excess of three  hundred  fifty
  million  dollars,  except  that  in the case of research and development
  property at the option of the taxpayer the applicable  percentage  shall
  be nine.
    (a-1)  For  a  taxpayer  that  is  an  eligible  farmer, as defined in
  subdivision eleven of this section, the percentage to be used to compute
  the credit allowed under this subdivision shall be  twenty  percent  for
  property  described  in  subparagraph  (i)  of  paragraph  (b)  of  this
  subdivision that is principally used by the taxpayer in  the  production
  of   goods   by  farming,  agriculture,  horticulture,  floriculture  or
  viticulture.
    (b) (i) A credit shall be allowed under this subdivision with  respect
  to  tangible  personal  property  and other tangible property, including
  buildings and structural components of buildings, which are: depreciable
  pursuant to section one hundred  sixty-seven  of  the  internal  revenue
  code, have a useful life of four years or more, are acquired by purchase
  as  defined  in  section  one  hundred  seventy-nine (d) of the internal
  revenue code, have a situs in this state and are (A) principally used by
  the taxpayer in the production of goods  by  manufacturing,  processing,
  assembling,   refining,   mining,   extracting,   farming,  agriculture,
  horticulture,  floriculture,  viticulture  or  commercial  fishing,  (B)
  industrial   waste   treatment   facilities  or  air  pollution  control
  facilities, used in the taxpayer's trade or business, (C)  research  and
  development  property, or (D) principally used in the ordinary course of
  the taxpayer's trade or business as a broker  or  dealer  in  connection
  with the purchase or sale (which shall include but not be limited to the
  issuance, entering into, assumption, offset, assignment, termination, or
  transfer)  of  stocks,  bonds  or other securities as defined in section
  four hundred seventy-five (c)(2) of the Internal  Revenue  Code,  or  of
  commodities  as  defined in section four hundred seventy-five (e) of the
  Internal Revenue Code, (E) principally used in the  ordinary  course  of
  the  taxpayer's  trade  or  business  of  providing  investment advisory
  services for a regulated investment company as defined in section  eight


 hundred  fifty-one  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code,  or  lending, loan
  arrangement or loan origination services to customers in connection with
  the purchase or sale (which shall include but  not  be  limited  to  the
  issuance, entering into, assumption, offset, assignment, termination, or
  transfer)  of securities as defined in section four hundred seventy-five
  (c)(2) of the  Internal  Revenue  Code,  (F)  principally  used  in  the
  ordinary  course of the taxpayer's business as an exchange registered as
  a national securities exchange within the meaning  of  sections  3(a)(1)
  and  6(a)  of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or a board of trade as
  defined in subparagraph one of paragraph (a) of section fourteen hundred
  ten of the not-for-profit corporation law or as an entity that is wholly
  owned by one or more such national securities  exchanges  or  boards  of
  trade and that provides automation or technical services thereto, or (G)
  principally  used  as  a  qualified  film  production facility including
  qualified film production facilities having a situs in  an  empire  zone
  designated  as  such  pursuant  to  article  eighteen-B  of  the general
  municipal law, where the taxpayer is providing three or more services to
  any qualified film production company using the facility, including such
  services as  a  studio  lighting  grid,  lighting  and  grip  equipment,
  multi-line  phone  service,  broadband  information  technology  access,
  industrial scale electrical capacity, food services, security  services,
  and  heating,  ventilation and air conditioning. For purposes of clauses
  (D), (E) and (F) of this subparagraph, property purchased by a  taxpayer
  affiliated  with  a  regulated  broker,  dealer,  registered  investment
  advisor, national securities exchange or board of trade,  is  allowed  a
  credit  under this subdivision if the property is used by its affiliated
  regulated  broker,  dealer,  registered  investment  advisor,   national
  securities   exchange   or  board  of  trade  in  accordance  with  this
  subdivision. For purposes of determining if the property is  principally
  used  in  qualifying uses, the uses by the taxpayer described in clauses
  (D) and (E) of this subparagraph may be  aggregated.  In  addition,  the
  uses  by  the  taxpayer,  its  affiliated  regulated  broker, dealer and
  registered investment advisor under either or both of those clauses  may
  be  aggregated.  Provided,  however, a taxpayer shall not be allowed the
  credit provided by clauses (D), (E) and (F) of this subparagraph  unless
  the  property  is  first  placed  in  service  before October first, two
  thousand fifteen and  (i)  eighty  percent  or  more  of  the  employees
  performing  the  administrative  and support functions resulting from or
  related to the qualifying uses of such equipment  are  located  in  this
  state  or  (ii)  the  average  number  of  employees  that  perform  the
  administrative and support functions resulting from or  related  to  the
  qualifying  uses  of such equipment and are located in this state during
  the taxable year for which the credit is claimed is equal to or  greater
  than ninety-five percent of the average number of employees that perform
  these  functions  and  are  located  in this state during the thirty-six
  months immediately preceding the year for which the credit  is  claimed,
  or  (iii)  the  number  of  employees  located  in this state during the
  taxable year for which the credit is claimed is equal to or greater than
  ninety percent of the number of  employees  located  in  this  state  on
  December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight or, if the taxpayer
  was  not  a calendar year taxpayer in nineteen hundred ninety-eight, the
  last day of its first taxable year ending after  December  thirty-first,
  nineteen hundred ninety-eight. If the taxpayer becomes subject to tax in
  this  state  after  the  taxable  year  beginning  in  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-eight,  then  the  taxpayer  is  not  required  to  satisfy   the
  employment  test provided in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph
  for its first taxable  year.  For  purposes  of  clause  (iii)  of  this
  subparagraph  the  employment  test  will  be  based  on  the  number of


 employees located in this state on the last day  of  the  first  taxable
  year  the  taxpayer  is subject to tax in this state. If the uses of the
  property must  be  aggregated  to  determine  whether  the  property  is
  principally  used  in  qualifying uses, then either each affiliate using
  the property must satisfy this employment test or this  employment  test
  must  be  satisfied  through  the  aggregation  of  the employees of the
  taxpayer,  its  affiliated  regulated  broker,  dealer,  and  registered
  investment  adviser  using  the  property. For purposes of clause (A) of
  this  subparagraph,  tangible  personal  property  and  other   tangible
  property  shall not include property principally used by the taxpayer in
  the  production  or  distribution  of  electricity,  natural  gas  after
  extraction  from  wells,  steam,  or  water  delivered through pipes and
  mains.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, the following  definitions  shall
  apply--
    (A) Manufacturing shall mean the process of working raw materials into
  wares  suitable  for  use  or which gives new shapes, new quality or new
  combinations to matter which already has gone  through  some  artificial
  process  by  the  use  of machinery, tools, appliances and other similar
  equipment. Property used  in  the  production  of  goods  shall  include
  machinery,  equipment  or  other  tangible property which is principally
  used in the repair and service of other machinery,  equipment  or  other
  tangible  property used principally in the production of goods and shall
  include all facilities  used  in  the  production  operation,  including
  storage  of  material  to be used in production and of the products that
  are produced.
    (B) Research and development property shall  mean  property  which  is
  used  for  purposes  of  research and development in the experimental or
  laboratory sense. Such purposes shall  not  be  deemed  to  include  the
  ordinary  testing  or  inspection  of  materials or products for quality
  control,  efficiency  surveys,  management  studies,  consumer  surveys,
  advertising,  promotions,  or  research  in  connection  with  literary,
  historical or similar projects.
    (C)  Industrial  waste  treatment  facilities  shall   mean   property
  constituting   facilities   for   the   treatment,   neutralization   or
  stabilization of  industrial  waste  and  other  wastes  (as  the  terms
  "industrial  waste" and "other wastes" are defined in section 17-0105 of
  the environmental conservation law) from a point  immediately  preceding
  the  point  of  such  treatment,  neutralization or stabilization to the
  point of disposal, including  the  necessary  pumping  and  transmitting
  facilities,  but  excluding  such  facilities  installed for the primary
  purpose of salvaging materials which are  usable  in  the  manufacturing
  process or are marketable.
    (D)  Air pollution control facilities shall mean property constituting
  facilities which remove, reduce, or render less noxious air contaminants
  emitted from an air contamination source (as the terms "air contaminant"
  and "air contamination source" are defined in  section  19-0107  of  the
  environmental  conservation  law) from a point immediately preceding the
  point of such removal, reduction or rendering to the point of  discharge
  of  air,  meeting emission standards as established by the department of
  environmental conservation, but excluding such facilities installed  for
  the  primary  purpose  of  salvaging  materials  which are usable in the
  manufacturing process or are marketable and excluding  those  facilities
  which rely for their efficacy on dilution, dispersion or assimilation of
  air  contaminants  in  the  ambient  air after emission. Such term shall
  further include flue gas desulfurization equipment and attendant  sludge
  disposal  facilities, fluidized bed boilers, precombustion coal cleaning
  facilities or other facilities that conform with  this  subdivision  and


 which  comply  with  the provisions of the state acid deposition control
  act set forth in title nine of article  nineteen  of  the  environmental
  conservation law.
    (E) The terms "qualified film production facility" and "qualified film
  production   company"   shall  have  the  same  meaning  as  in  section
  twenty-four of this chapter.
    (iii) However, such credit shall be allowed with respect to industrial
  waste treatment facilities and air pollution control facilities only  on
  condition  that  such  facilities  have  been  certified  by  the  state
  commissioner   of   environmental   conservation   or   his   designated
  representative,  pursuant  to  subdivision  one  of  section  17-0707 or
  subdivision one of section 19-0309  of  the  environmental  conservation
  law,  as  complying  with  applicable  provisions  of  the environmental
  conservation law, the public health law, the  state  sanitary  code  and
  codes, rules, regulations, permits or orders issued pursuant thereto.
    (c)  A  taxpayer  shall not be allowed a credit under this subdivision
  with respect to tangible personal property and other tangible  property,
  including  buildings  and  structural  components of buildings, which it
  leases to any other person or corporation except where a taxpayer leases
  property  to  an  affiliated  regulated   broker,   dealer,   registered
  investment  adviser,  national securities exchange or board of trade (or
  other entity described in clause (F) of subparagraph  (i)  of  paragraph
  (b)  of  this  subdivision)  that  uses such property in accordance with
  clause (D), (E) or (F) of subparagraph (i)  of  paragraph  (b)  of  this
  subdivision.    For  purposes of the preceding sentence, any contract or
  agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use such  property  shall
  be  considered  a  lease.  Provided,  however,  in determining whether a
  taxpayer shall be allowed a credit under this subdivision  with  respect
  to  such  property,  any  election  made  with  respect to such property
  pursuant to the provisions of  paragraph  eight  of  subsection  (f)  of
  section  one  hundred  sixty-eight of the internal revenue code, as such
  paragraph was in effect for agreements entered  into  prior  to  January
  first,  nineteen hundred eighty-four, shall be disregarded. For purposes
  of this paragraph, the use of a qualified film production facility by  a
  qualified  film  production  company  shall not be considered a lease of
  such facility to such company.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the credit allowed
  under this subdivision for any taxable year shall not reduce the tax due
  for such year to less than the fixed dollar minimum amount prescribed in
  paragraph (d) of subdivision one of section  two  hundred  ten  of  this
  article.   However,  if  the  amount  of  credit  allowable  under  this
  subdivision for any taxable year reduces the tax to such  amount  or  if
  the  taxpayer  otherwise  pays  tax  based  on  the fixed dollar minimum
  amount, any amount of credit allowed for a taxable year commencing prior
  to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven and  not  deductible  in
  such taxable year may be carried over to the following year or years and
  may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years but in no
  event  shall  such credit be carried over to taxable years commencing on
  or after January first, two thousand  two,  and  any  amount  of  credit
  allowed  for  a  taxable  year  commencing  on  or  after January first,
  nineteen hundred eighty-seven and not deductible in  such  year  may  be
  carried  over  to  the fifteen taxable years next following such taxable
  year and may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years.
  In lieu of such carryover, (i) any such taxpayer which  qualifies  as  a
  new  business under paragraph (f) of this subdivision may elect to treat
  the amount of such carryover as an overpayment of tax to be credited  or
  refunded  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  section ten hundred
  eighty-six of this chapter, and  (ii)  any  such  taxpayer  that  is  an


 eligible  farmer,  as defined in subdivision eleven of this section, may
  for  taxable  years  beginning  before  January  first,   two   thousand
  twenty-eight,  elect  to  treat  the  amount  of  such  carryover  as an
  overpayment  of  tax  to  be credited or refunded in accordance with the
  provisions of section one thousand eighty-six of this chapter, provided,
  however, the  provisions  of  subsection  (c)  of  section  ten  hundred
  eighty-eight  of this chapter notwithstanding, no interest shall be paid
  thereon.
    (e) (1) With respect to property  which  is  depreciable  pursuant  to
  section  one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code but is not
  subject to the provisions of section one  hundred  sixty-eight  of  such
  code  and which is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to
  the end of the taxable year in which the credit  is  to  be  taken,  the
  amount of the credit shall be that portion of the credit provided for in
  this  subdivision  which  represents  the  ratio  which  the  months  of
  qualified use bear to the months of useful life. If  property  on  which
  credit  has  been  taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use
  prior to the end of its useful life, the difference between  the  credit
  taken  and  the  credit allowed for actual use must be added back in the
  year of disposition. Provided, however, if such property is disposed  of
  or  ceases to be in qualified use after it has been in qualified use for
  more than twelve consecutive years, it shall not  be  necessary  to  add
  back  the  credit as provided in this subparagraph. The amount of credit
  allowed for actual use shall be determined by multiplying  the  original
  credit by the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to the months
  of  useful  life.  For  purposes  of  this  subparagraph, useful life of
  property shall be  the  same  as  the  taxpayer  uses  for  depreciation
  purposes when computing his federal income tax liability.
    (2) Except with respect to that property to which subparagraph four of
  this  paragraph applies, with respect to three-year property, as defined
  in subsection (e) of section one hundred  sixty-eight  of  the  internal
  revenue  code,  which  is  disposed  of or ceases to be in qualified use
  prior to the end of the taxable year in which the credit is to be taken,
  the amount of the credit shall be that portion of  the  credit  provided
  for  in  this subdivision which represents the ratio which the months of
  qualified use bear to thirty-six. If property on which credit  has  been
  taken  is  disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to the end
  of thirty-six months, the difference between the credit  taken  and  the
  credit  allowed  for  actual  use  must  be  added  back  in the year of
  disposition. The amount of  credit  allowed  for  actual  use  shall  be
  determined  by  multiplying  the  original credit by the ratio which the
  months of qualified use bear to thirty-six.
    (3) Except with respect to that property to which subparagraph four of
  this  paragraph  applies,  with  respect  to  property  subject  to  the
  provisions  of  section  one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue
  code, other than three-year property as defined  in  subsection  (e)  of
  such  section  one hundred sixty-eight which is disposed of or ceases to
  be in qualified use prior to the end of the taxable year  in  which  the
  credit is to be taken, the amount of the credit shall be that portion of
  the  credit  provided for in this subdivision which represents the ratio
  which the months of qualified use bear to sixty. If  property  on  which
  credit  has  been  taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use
  prior to the end of sixty months,  the  difference  between  the  credit
  taken  and  the  credit allowed for actual use must be added back in the
  year of disposition. The amount of credit allowed for actual  use  shall
  be  determined by multiplying the original credit by the ratio which the
  months of qualified use bear to sixty.


   (4) With  respect  to  any  property  to  which  section  one  hundred
  sixty-eight of the internal revenue code applies, which is a building or
  a  structural component of a building and which is disposed of or ceases
  to be in qualified use prior to the end of the taxable year in which the
  credit is to be taken, the amount of the credit shall be that portion of
  the  credit  provided for in this subdivision which represents the ratio
  which the months of qualified use bear to the  total  number  of  months
  over  which  the  taxpayer  chooses  to  deduct  the  property under the
  internal revenue code. If property on which credit  has  been  taken  is
  disposed  of  or  ceases  to be in qualified use prior to the end of the
  period over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the property under  the
  internal  revenue  code, the difference between the credit taken and the
  credit allowed for actual  use  must  be  added  back  in  the  year  of
  disposition.  Provided,  however,  if  such  property  is disposed of or
  ceases to be in qualified use after it has been  in  qualified  use  for
  more  than  twelve  consecutive  years, it shall not be necessary to add
  back the credit as provided in this subparagraph. The amount  of  credit
  allowed  for  actual use shall be determined by multiplying the original
  credit by the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to the  total
  number  of months over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the property
  under the internal revenue code.
    (5) For purposes of this paragraph, property (i) which is described in
  subparagraph two, three or four of this paragraph,  and  (ii)  which  is
  subject  to subparagraph eleven of paragraph (a) of subdivision nine and
  subparagraph ten of paragraph (b) of subdivision  nine  of  section  two
  hundred  eight  of  this  chapter, shall be treated as property which is
  depreciable pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the  internal
  revenue  code  but  is not subject to section one hundred sixty-eight of
  such code.
    (6) For purposes of this paragraph, where a  credit  is  allowed  with
  respect  to  an  air  pollution  control  facility  on  the  basis  of a
  certificate  of  compliance  issued  pursuant   to   the   environmental
  conservation  law and the certificate is revoked pursuant to subdivision
  three of section 19-0309 of the  environmental  conservation  law,  such
  revocation  shall  constitute  a disposal or cessation of qualified use,
  unless such facility is described in clause (A) or (C)  of  subparagraph
  (ii)  of  paragraph  (b)  of this subdivision. Also for purposes of this
  subparagraph, the use  of  an  air  pollution  control  facility  or  an
  industrial waste treatment facility for the primary purpose of salvaging
  materials   which  are  usable  in  the  manufacturing  process  or  are
  marketable shall constitute a cessation of qualified  use,  unless  such
  facility  is  described  in  clause  (A)  or (C) of subparagraph (ii) of
  paragraph (b) of this subdivision.
    (7) For taxable years commencing on or after January  first,  nineteen
  hundred  eighty-seven,  the amount required to be added back pursuant to
  this paragraph shall be augmented by an amount equal to the  product  of
  such  amount  and  the  underpayment rate of interest (without regard to
  compounding), set by the commissioner of taxation and  finance  pursuant
  to  subsection  (e) of section one thousand ninety-six, in effect on the
  last day of the taxable year.
    (8) If, as of the close of the taxable year, there is a  net  increase
  with  respect  to the taxpayer in the amount of nonqualified nonrecourse
  financing (within the meaning of  section  46(c)  (8)  of  the  internal
  revenue  code)  with  respect  to any property with respect to which the
  credit  under  this  subdivision  was  limited  based  on   attributable
  nonqualified nonrecourse financing, then an amount equal to the decrease
  in such credit which would have resulted from reducing, by the amount of
  such  net  increase,  the  cost  or  other basis taken into account with


 respect to such property must be added back in such  taxable  year.  The
  amount  of  nonqualified  nonrecourse  financing shall not be treated as
  increased by reason of a transfer of  (or  agreement  to  transfer)  any
  evidence  of  an indebtedness if such transfer occurs (or such agreement
  is entered into) more than one year after the date such indebtedness was
  incurred.
    (f) For purposes of paragraph (d) of this subdivision, a new  business
  shall include any corporation, except a corporation which:
    (1)  over fifty percent of the number of shares of stock entitling the
  holders thereof to vote for the election of  directors  or  trustees  is
  owned  or  controlled,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  by a taxpayer
  subject to tax under this article; section one hundred eighty-three, one
  hundred eighty-four or one  hundred  eighty-five  of  article  nine;  or
  article thirty-three of this chapter; or
    (2)  is  substantially  similar  in  operation  and  in ownership to a
  business entity (or entities) taxable, or previously taxable, under this
  article; section one  hundred  eighty-three,  one  hundred  eighty-four,
  former  section  one  hundred  eighty-five or former section one hundred
  eighty-six of article nine; article thirty-two of this chapter  as  such
  article  was  in effect on December thirty-first, two thousand fourteen;
  article thirty-three of  this  chapter;  article  twenty-three  of  this
  chapter  or  which  would  have  been  subject to tax under such article
  twenty-three (as such article was in effect on January  first,  nineteen
  hundred  eighty)  or  the  income  (or  losses)  of  which  is  (or was)
  includable under article twenty-two of this chapter whereby  the  intent
  and purpose of this paragraph and paragraph (d) of this subdivision with
  respect to refunding of credit to new business would be evaded; or
    (3)  has  been  subject  to  tax  under this article or former article
  thirty-two of this chapter for more than five taxable  years  (excluding
  short taxable years).
    2.  Employment  Incentive  Credit (EIC). (a)(i) Application of credit.
  Where a taxpayer is allowed a  credit  under  subdivision  one  of  this
  section,  other  than  at  the  optional rate applicable to research and
  development property, the taxpayer shall be allowed a credit for each of
  the two years next succeeding the taxable  year  for  which  the  credit
  under  such  subdivision  one  is allowed with respect to such property,
  whether or not deductible in such taxable year or in subsequent  taxable
  years  pursuant  to  paragraph  (d)  of  such subdivision one. Provided,
  however, that the  credit  allowable  under  this  subdivision  for  any
  taxable  year  shall  be allowed only if the average number of employees
  during such taxable year is at least one  hundred  one  percent  of  the
  average  number  of  employees  during  the  employment  base  year. The
  employment base year shall be the taxable year immediately preceding the
  taxable year for which the credit under such subdivision one is  allowed
  except  that  if  the taxpayer was not subject to tax and did not have a
  taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year for which the credit
  under such subdivision one of this section is  allowed,  the  employment
  base  year  shall  be  the  taxable  year in which the credit under such
  subdivision one is allowed.
    (ii) Amount of credit. The amount of the  credit  allowed  under  this
  subdivision shall be as set forth in the following table:
  Average number of employees during the      Credit allowed under this
  taxable year expressed as a percentage      subdivision expressed as a
  of average employees in employment          percentage of the applicable
  base years                                  investment credit basis
  Less than 102%                              1.5%
  At least 102% and less than 103%            2%
  At least 103%                               2.5%


   (b)  Average number of employees. The average number of employees in a
  taxable year shall be computed by ascertaining the number  of  employees
  within  the  state,  except  general executive officers, employed by the
  taxpayer on the thirty-first day of March, the thirtieth  day  of  June,
  the  thirtieth  day of September and the thirty-first day of December in
  the taxable year, by adding together the number of employees ascertained
  on each of such dates and dividing the sum so obtained by the number  of
  such  above  mentioned dates occurring within the taxable year. However,
  with respect to the  employment  base  year,  there  shall  be  excluded
  therefrom  any employee with respect to whom a credit provided for under
  subdivision six of this section is claimed, for the taxable year,  based
  on  employment within a zone equivalent area designated as such pursuant
  to article eighteen-B of the general municipal law.
    (c) Carryover. In no event shall the credit  herein  provided  for  be
  allowed  in an amount which will reduce the tax payable to less than the
  fixed dollar minimum amount prescribed in paragraph (d)  of  subdivision
  one  of  section two hundred ten of this article. However, if the amount
  of credit allowable under this subdivision for any taxable year  reduces
  the  tax  to  such amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax based on
  the fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit not deductible  in
  such  taxable  year  may  be  carried  over to the fifteen taxable years
  immediately following such taxable year and may  be  deducted  from  the
  taxpayer's tax for such year or years.
    3. Empire zone investment tax credit (EZ-ITC). (a) A taxpayer shall be
  allowed  a  credit,  to  be computed as herein provided, against the tax
  imposed by this article if the taxpayer has been certified  pursuant  to
  article  eighteen-B  of  the  general  municipal  law. The amount of the
  credit shall be ten percent of the  cost  or  other  basis  for  federal
  income  tax  purposes  of  tangible personal property and other tangible
  property, including buildings and structural  components  of  buildings,
  described  in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, which is located within
  an empire zone designated as such pursuant to article eighteen-B of such
  law, but  only  if  the  acquisition,  construction,  reconstruction  or
  erection of such property occurred or was commenced on or after the date
  of  such  designation  and  prior  to  the expiration thereof. Provided,
  however,  that  in   the   case   of   an   acquisition,   construction,
  reconstruction  or  erection  which was commenced during such period and
  continued or completed subsequently, such credit shall be ten percent of
  the portion of the cost or other basis for federal income  tax  purposes
  attributable  to  such  period,  which  portion  shall be ascertained by
  multiplying such cost or basis by a  fraction  the  numerator  of  which
  shall  be  the expenditures paid or incurred during such period for such
  purposes and the  denominator  of  which  shall  be  the  total  of  all
  expenditures  paid  or  incurred  for  such  acquisition,  construction,
  reconstruction or erection.
    (b)  Qualified  property.  A  credit  shall  be  allowed  under   this
  subdivision  with  respect  to  tangible  personal  property  and  other
  tangible property, including  buildings  and  structural  components  of
  buildings, which
    (i) are depreciable pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the
  internal revenue code,
    (ii) have a useful life of four years or more,
    (iii)  are  acquired  by  purchase  as  defined in section one hundred
  seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code,
    (iv) have a situs in an empire zone designated  as  such  pursuant  to
  article eighteen-B of the general municipal law, and
    (v)  are  (A)  principally  used  by the taxpayer in the production of
  goods  by  manufacturing,  processing,  assembling,  refining,   mining,


 extracting,    farming,    agriculture,    horticulture,   floriculture,
  viticulture or commercial fishing,
    (B)  industrial  waste  treatment  facilities or air pollution control
  facilities used in the taxpayer's trade or business,
    (C) research and development property,
    (D) principally used in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or
  business as a broker or dealer in connection with the purchase  or  sale
  (which  shall include but not be limited to the issuance, entering into,
  assumption, offset, assignment, termination,  or  transfer)  of  stocks,
  bonds   or   other   securities  as  defined  in  section  four  hundred
  seventy-five (c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, or of  commodities  as
  defined in section four hundred seventy-five (e) of the Internal Revenue
  Code,
    (E) principally used in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or
  business  of  providing  investment  advisory  services  for a regulated
  investment company as defined in section eight hundred fifty-one of  the
  Internal Revenue Code, or lending, loan arrangement, or loan origination
  services  to  customers  in  connection with the purchase or sale (which
  shall include but  not  be  limited  to  the  issuance,  entering  into,
  assumption,  offset,  assignment, termination or transfer) of securities
  as defined in section four hundred seventy-five (c)(2) of  the  Internal
  Revenue Code,
    (E-1)  principally used in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade
  or business of providing investment advisory services or the service  of
  managing investment portfolios to achieve specific investment objectives
  for  accounts  over one million dollars of accredited investors (as that
  term is defined in rule 501 of regulation D of  the  Securities  Act  of
  1933), if the taxpayer satisfies the following criteria:
    (I)  the taxpayer is a regulated broker or dealer or an affiliate of a
  regulated broker or dealer,
    (II) the taxpayer is registered as an investment adviser under section
  two hundred three of the Investment Advisers Act of  1940,  as  amended,
  and
    (III)  at  least  one client of the taxpayer is a regulated investment
  company as defined in section eight hundred fifty-one  of  the  internal
  revenue code that has assets of one hundred million dollars, or
    (F) principally used in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's business
  as  an  exchange registered as a national securities exchange within the
  meaning of sections 3(a)(1) and 6(a) of the Securities Exchange  Act  of
  1934  or a board of trade as defined in subdivision one of paragraph (a)
  of section fourteen hundred ten of the not-for-profit corporation law or
  as an entity  that  is  wholly  owned  by  one  or  more  such  national
  securities  exchanges or boards or trade and that provides automation or
  technical services thereto.
    (vi) For purposes of clauses (D), (E), (E-1) and (F)  of  subparagraph
  (v)  of this paragraph, property purchased by a taxpayer affiliated with
  a regulated broker,  dealer,  registered  investment  adviser,  national
  securities  exchange  or  board  of trade is allowed a credit under this
  subdivision if the property is used by its affiliated regulated  broker,
  dealer, registered investment adviser or national securities exchange or
  board  of  trade  in  accordance  with this subdivision. For purposes of
  determining if the property is principally used in qualifying uses,  the
  uses  by  the  taxpayer  described  in  clauses  (D),  (E)  and (E-1) of
  subparagraph (v) of this paragraph may be aggregated. In  addition,  the
  uses  by  the  taxpayer,  its  affiliated  regulated  broker, dealer and
  registered  investment  adviser  under  any  of  those  clauses  may  be
  aggregated.  Provided,  however,  a  taxpayer  shall  not be allowed the


 credit provided by clauses (D), (E), (E-1) and (F) of  subparagraph  (v)
  of this paragraph unless
    (I)   eighty   percent   or  more  of  the  employees  performing  the
  administrative and support functions resulting from or  related  to  the
  qualifying uses of such equipment are located in this state, or
    (II)  the  average number of employees that perform the administrative
  and support functions resulting from or related to the  qualifying  uses
  of  such equipment and are located in this state during the taxable year
  for which the credit is claimed is equal to or greater than  ninety-five
  percent  of the average number of employees that perform these functions
  and are located in this state during the thirty-six  months  immediately
  preceding the year for which the credit is claimed, or
    (III) the number of employees located in this state during the taxable
  year  for which the credit is claimed is equal to or greater than ninety
  percent of the number of employees located in  this  state  on  December
  thirty-first,  nineteen hundred ninety-eight or, if the taxpayer was not
  a calendar year taxpayer in nineteen hundred ninety-eight, the last  day
  of  its  first taxable year ending after December thirty-first, nineteen
  hundred ninety-eight. If the taxpayer becomes subject  to  tax  in  this
  state after the taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred ninety-eight,
  then  the  taxpayer  is  not  required  to  satisfy  the employment test
  provided in the preceding sentence of this subparagraph  for  its  first
  taxable year.
    (vii)  For  the  purposes of clause (III) of subparagraph (vi) of this
  paragraph the employment test will be based on the number  of  employees
  located  in  this  state  on  the last day of the first taxable year the
  taxpayer is subject to tax in this state. If the uses  of  the  property
  must be aggregated to determine whether the property is principally used
  in  qualifying  uses, then either each affiliate using the property must
  satisfy this employment test or this employment test must  be  satisfied
  through the aggregation of the employees of the taxpayer, its affiliated
  regulated  broker,  dealer,  and registered investment adviser using the
  property.
    (viii) For the purpose of this subdivision, the term "goods" shall not
  include electricity.
    (ix) For purposes of this subdivision, "manufacturing" shall mean  the
  process  of  working  raw materials into wares suitable for use or which
  gives new shapes, new  quality  or  new  combinations  to  matter  which
  already  has  gone  through  some  artificial  process  by  the  use  of
  machinery, tools, appliances and other similar equipment. Property  used
  in  the  production of goods shall include machinery, equipment or other
  tangible property which is principally used in the repair and service of
  other machinery, equipment or other tangible property  used  principally
  in  the production of goods and shall include all facilities used in the
  production operation, including  storage  of  material  to  be  used  in
  production  and  of the products that are produced. For purposes of this
  subdivision, the terms "research and development property",  "industrial
  waste  treatment  facilities",  and  "air  pollution control facilities"
  shall have the meanings ascribed thereto by clauses (B),  (C)  and  (D),
  respectively,  of  subparagraph (iv) of paragraph (b) of subdivision one
  of this  section,  and  the  provisions  of  subparagraph  (v)  of  such
  paragraph (b) shall apply.
    (c)  Nonqualified  property.  A taxpayer shall not be allowed a credit
  under this subdivision with respect to any  tangible  personal  property
  and   other   tangible  property,  including  buildings  and  structural
  components of  buildings,  which  it  leases  to  any  other  person  or
  corporation  except  where  a  taxpayer leases property to an affiliated
  regulated  broker,  dealer,  registered  investment  adviser,   national


 securities  exchange  or  board  of  trade  or other entity described in
  clause (F) of subparagraph (v) of paragraph (b) of this subdivision that
  uses such property in accordance with clause (D), (E), (E-1) or  (F)  of
  subparagraph  (v)  of paragraph (b) of this subdivision. For purposes of
  the preceding sentence, any contract or agreement to lease  or  rent  or
  for  a  license  to  use  such  property  shall  be  considered a lease.
  Provided, however, in determining whether a taxpayer shall be allowed  a
  credit  under  this  subdivision  with  respect  to  such  property, any
  election made with respect to such property pursuant to  the  provisions
  of  paragraph eight of subsection (f) of section one hundred sixty-eight
  of the internal revenue code,  as  such  paragraph  was  in  effect  for
  agreements  entered  into  prior  to  January  first,  nineteen  hundred
  eighty-four, shall be disregarded.
    (d) Carryover. The credit  allowed  under  this  subdivision  for  any
  taxable year shall not reduce the tax due for such year to less than the
  fixed  dollar  minimum amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision
  one of section two hundred ten of this article. Provided, however,  that
  if  the  amount of credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable
  year reduces the tax to such amount or if the  taxpayer  otherwise  pays
  tax  based  on the fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit not
  deductible in such taxable year may be carried  over  to  the  following
  year  or years and may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year
  or years. In lieu of such carryover, any such taxpayer  which  qualifies
  as a new business under paragraph (f) of subdivision one of this section
  may elect, on its report for its taxable year with respect to which such
  credit  is  allowed,  to  treat  fifty  percent  of  the  amount of such
  carryover as an overpayment  of  tax  to  be  credited  or  refunded  in
  accordance  with  the  provisions  of section one thousand eighty-six of
  this chapter. In addition, any taxpayer which is approved as  the  owner
  of  a  qualified  investment project or a significant capital investment
  project pursuant to subdivision (w) of section nine  hundred  fifty-nine
  of  the  general  municipal law, on its report for its taxable year with
  respect to which such credit is allowed, in lieu of such carryover,  may
  elect  to  treat  fifty percent of the amount of such carryover which is
  attributable to the credit allowed under this subdivision  for  property
  which is part of such project as an overpayment of tax to be credited or
  refunded  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of section one thousand
  eighty-six of this chapter.  Provided,  however,  such  owner  shall  be
  allowed  such  refund for a maximum of ten taxable years with respect to
  such  qualified  investment  project  and   each   significant   capital
  investment  project,  starting  with  the  first  taxable  year in which
  property  comprising  such  project  is  placed  in  service.  Provided,
  further,  however,  the  provisions  of  subsection  (c)  of section one
  thousand eighty-eight of this chapter notwithstanding, no interest shall
  be paid thereon.
    (d-1) Any carryover of a credit from prior taxable years will  not  be
  allowed  if  an empire zone retention certificate is not issued pursuant
  to subdivision (w) of section nine hundred  fifty-nine  of  the  general
  municipal  law  to  the empire zone enterprise which is the basis of the
  credit.
    (e) At the option of the taxpayer, the taxpayer may  choose  to  claim
  the  credit  described in paragraph (a) of this subdivision for property
  which also qualifies for the credit provided under  subdivision  one  of
  this  section.  A  taxpayer  shall  not  be  allowed a credit under this
  subdivision with respect to any property described in paragraph  (a)  of
  this  subdivision  if  a  credit is taken pursuant to subdivision one of
  this section.


   (f) Recapture. (i) With  respect  to  property  which  is  depreciable
  pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code
  but  is not subject to the provisions of section one hundred sixty-eight
  of such code and which is disposed of or ceases to be in  qualified  use
  prior to the end of the taxable year in which the credit is to be taken,
  the  amount  of  the credit shall be that portion of the credit provided
  for in this subdivision which represents the ratio which the  months  of
  qualified  use  bear  to the months of useful life. If property on which
  credit has been taken is disposed of or ceases to be  in  qualified  use
  prior  to  the end of its useful life, the difference between the credit
  taken and the credit allowed for actual use must be added  back  in  the
  year  of disposition. Provided, however, if such property is disposed of
  or ceases to be in qualified use after it has been in qualified use  for
  more  than  twelve  consecutive  years, it shall not be necessary to add
  back the credit as provided in this subparagraph. The amount  of  credit
  allowed  for  actual use shall be determined by multiplying the original
  credit by the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to the months
  of useful life. For  purposes  of  this  subparagraph,  useful  life  of
  property  shall  be  the  same  as  the  taxpayer  uses for depreciation
  purposes when computing his federal income tax liability.
    (ii) Except with respect to that property to which  subparagraph  (iv)
  of  this  paragraph  applies,  with  respect  to three-year property, as
  defined in subsection (e) of section  one  hundred  sixty-eight  of  the
  internal revenue code, which is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified
  use  prior  to  the end of the taxable year in which the credit is to be
  taken, the amount of the credit shall be  that  portion  of  the  credit
  provided  for  in  this subdivision which represents the ratio which the
  months of qualified use bear to thirty-six. If property on which  credit
  has  been taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to
  the end of thirty-six months, the difference between  the  credit  taken
  and  the credit allowed for actual use must be added back in the year of
  disposition. The amount of  credit  allowed  for  actual  use  shall  be
  determined  by  multiplying  the  original credit by the ratio which the
  months of qualified use bear to thirty-six.
    (iii) Except with respect to that property to which subparagraph  (iv)
  of  this  paragraph  applies,  with  respect  to property subject to the
  provisions of section one hundred sixty-eight of  the  internal  revenue
  code other than three-year property as defined in subsection (e) of such
  section  one hundred sixty-eight which is disposed of or ceases to be in
  qualified use prior to the end of the taxable year in which  the  credit
  is  to  be  taken, the amount of the credit shall be that portion of the
  credit provided for in this subdivision which represents the ratio which
  the months of qualified use bear to sixty. If property on  which  credit
  has  been taken is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior to
  the end of sixty months, the difference between the credit taken and the
  credit allowed for actual  use  must  be  added  back  in  the  year  of
  disposition.  The  amount  of  credit  allowed  for  actual use shall be
  determined by multiplying the original credit by  the  ratio  which  the
  months of qualified use bear to sixty.
    (iv)  With  respect  to  any  property  to  which  section one hundred
  sixty-eight of the internal revenue code applies, which is a building or
  a structural component of a building and which is disposed of or  ceases
  to be in qualified use prior to the end of the taxable year in which the
  credit is to be taken, the amount of the credit shall be that portion of
  the  credit  provided for in this subdivision which represents the ratio
  which the months of qualified use bear to the  total  number  of  months
  over  which  the  taxpayer  chooses  to  deduct  the  property under the
  internal revenue code. If property on which credit  has  been  taken  is


 disposed  of  or  ceases  to be in qualified use prior to the end of the
  period over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the property under  the
  internal  revenue  code, the difference between the credit taken and the
  credit  allowed  for  actual  use  must  be  added  back  in the year of
  disposition. Provided, however, if  such  property  is  disposed  of  or
  ceases  to  be  in  qualified use after it has been in qualified use for
  more than twelve consecutive years, it shall not  be  necessary  to  add
  back  the  credit as provided in this subparagraph. The amount of credit
  allowed for actual use shall be determined by multiplying  the  original
  credit  by the ratio which the months of qualified use bear to the total
  number of months over which the taxpayer chooses to deduct the  property
  under the internal revenue code.
    (v) For purposes of this paragraph, disposal or cessation of qualified
  use  shall  not  be  deemed  to  have  occurred  solely by reason of the
  termination or expiration of an empire zone's designation as such.
    (vi)(A) For purposes of  this  paragraph,  the  decertification  of  a
  business  enterprise  with  respect to an empire zone shall constitute a
  disposal or cessation of qualified use of  the  property  on  which  the
  credit   was   taken   which  is  located  in  the  zone  to  which  the
  decertification applies, on the effective date of such decertification.
    (B) Where a business  enterprise  has  been  decertified  based  on  a
  finding  pursuant  to  clause  one,  two,  or five of subdivision (a) of
  section nine hundred fifty-nine of the general municipal law, the amount
  required to be added back by reason of this paragraph shall be  (I)  the
  amount  of  credit, with respect to the property which is disposed of or
  ceases to be in qualified use, which was deducted  from  the  taxpayer's
  tax  otherwise  due  under  this  article  for  all prior taxable years,
  reduced (but not below zero) by (II) the credit allowed for actual  use.
  For  purposes of this subparagraph, the attribution to specific property
  of credit amounts deducted from tax shall be established  in  accordance
  with  the  date  of  placement in service of such property in the empire
  zone.
    (C) In no event shall the amount of the  credit  allowed  pursuant  to
  this  subdivision  be  rendered,  solely by reason of clause (A) of this
  subparagraph, less than the amount of the credit to which  the  taxpayer
  would otherwise be entitled under subdivision one of this section.
    (D)  Notwithstanding  any  other provision of this subdivision, in the
  case of a business enterprise which has been decertified, any amount  of
  credit  allowed with respect to the property of such business enterprise
  located in the zone  to  which  the  decertification  applies  which  is
  carried  over pursuant to paragraph (d) of this subdivision shall not be
  carried over beyond the seventh taxable year next following the  taxable
  year  with  respect to which the credit provided for in this subdivision
  was allowed.
    (vii) For purposes of this paragraph, where a credit is  allowed  with
  respect  to  an  air  pollution  control  facility  on  the  basis  of a
  certificate  of  compliance  issued  pursuant   to   the   environmental
  conservation  law and the certificate is revoked pursuant to subdivision
  three of section 19-0309 of the  environmental  conservation  law,  such
  revocation  shall  constitute  a disposal or cessation of qualified use,
  except with respect to property contained in or comprising such facility
  which is described in clause (A), (B), or (C)  of  subparagraph  (v)  of
  paragraph (b) of this subdivision other than as part of or comprising an
  air pollution control facility. Also for purposes of this paragraph, the
  use  of  an  air  pollution  control  facility  or  an  industrial waste
  treatment facility for the primary purpose of salvaging materials  which
  are  usable  in  the  manufacturing  process  or  are  marketable  shall
  constitute a cessation of qualified use, except with respect to property


 contained in or comprising such facility which is  described  in  clause
  (A) or (C) of subparagraph (v) of paragraph (b) of this subdivision.
    (viii)  Except  as provided in this subparagraph, this paragraph shall
  not apply to a credit allowed by this subdivision to a taxpayer that  is
  a  partner  in  a  partnership  in  the  case of manufacturing property;
  provided, at the time such  property  was  placed  in  service  by  such
  partnership  in an empire zone the basis for federal income tax purposes
  for such property (or a project that includes such property) equaled  or
  exceeded  three  hundred  million  dollars  and  such  partner owned its
  partnership interest for  at  least  three  years  from  the  date  such
  property  was  placed  in  service.  If  such  property  ceases to be in
  qualified use after it is placed in service, this paragraph shall  apply
  to  such  partner  in  the year such property ceases to be in qualifying
  use.
    (ix) If a taxpayer, which is approved by the commissioner of  economic
  development  as  the  owner  of  a  qualified  investment  project  or a
  significant capital investment project pursuant to  subdivision  (w)  of
  section  nine  hundred fifty-nine of the general municipal law, fails to
  (A) create at least the minimum  number  of  jobs  at  such  project  as
  required  by  the  provisions  of subdivision (s) or (t) of section nine
  hundred  fifty-seven  and  subdivision  (w)  of  section  nine   hundred
  fifty-nine of the general municipal law or (B) place in service property
  comprising  such  qualified  investment  project  or significant capital
  investment project with a basis for federal income tax purposes equaling
  or exceeding the applicable minimum required basis as provided  in  such
  subdivision  (s)  or  (t), whichever is relevant, by the last day of the
  fifth taxable year following the taxable year in which a credit is first
  allowed under this subdivision for the  property  which  comprises  such
  qualified  investment  project  or  such  significant capital investment
  project, the total amount of the credit allowed under  this  subdivision
  for  all taxable years with respect to the property which comprises such
  project which has been refunded to such taxpayer shall be added back  in
  such taxable year.
    (g)  Notwithstanding  the expiration of the empire zones program under
  article eighteen-B of the general municipal  law,  a  taxpayer  that  is
  certified  as  a  qualified  investment project pursuant to such article
  eight-B on the day  immediately  preceding  the  day  the  empire  zones
  program expired shall continue to be deemed certified under such article
  eighteen-B  for  purposes  of  this subdivision for the remainder of the
  taxable  year  in  which  the  expiration  occurred  and  for  the  next
  succeeding  nine  taxable  years.  In  addition, the areas designated as
  empire  zones  in  which  the  taxpayer  is  certified  as  a  qualified
  investment  project  on the day immediately preceding the day the empire
  zones program expired shall continue  to  be  deemed  empire  zones  for
  purposes  of  this  subdivision for the remainder of the taxable year in
  which the expiration occurred and for the next succeeding  nine  taxable
  years.
    (h)  Notwithstanding  the expiration of the empire zones program under
  article eighteen-B of the general municipal law and except  as  provided
  in paragraph (g) of this subdivision, a taxpayer that is certified as an
  empire  zone  business  pursuant  to  such article eighteen-B on the day
  immediately preceding the day the  empire  zone  program  expired  shall
  continue  to  be  deemed  certified  under  such  article eighteen-B for
  purposes of this subdivision until April first, two  thousand  fourteen.
  In  addition, the areas designated as empire zones in which the taxpayer
  is certified as an empire zone business on the day immediately preceding
  the day the empire zones program expired shall  continue  to  be  deemed


 empire  zones  for  purposes of this subdivisions until April first, two
  thousand fourteen.
    4.  Empire  zone employment incentive credit (EZ-EIC). (a) Application
  of credit. Where a taxpayer is allowed a credit under subdivision  three
  of  this section, the taxpayer shall be allowed a credit for each of the
  three years next succeeding the taxable year for which the credit  under
  such  subdivision  three  is  allowed,  with  respect  to such property,
  whether or not deductible in such taxable year or in subsequent  taxable
  years  pursuant  to  paragraph  (d) of such subdivision three, of thirty
  percent of the credit allowable under such subdivision three;  provided,
  however,  that  the  credit  allowable  under  this  subdivision for any
  taxable year shall only be allowed if the average  number  of  employees
  employed  by  the  taxpayer  in  the empire zone, designated pursuant to
  article eighteen-B of the general municipal law, in which such  property
  is  located during such taxable year is at least one hundred one percent
  of the average number of employees employed  by  the  taxpayer  in  such
  empire  zone,  during the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable
  year for which the credit under such subdivision three  is  allowed  and
  provided,  further,  that if the taxpayer was not subject to tax and did
  not have a taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year for which
  the credit under subdivision three  of  this  section  is  allowed,  the
  credit  allowable  under  this subdivision for any taxable year shall be
  allowed if the average number of employees employed in such empire  zone
  in  such taxable year is at least one hundred one percent of the average
  number of such employees during the taxable year  in  which  the  credit
  under such subdivision three is allowed.
    (b)  Average  number  of  employees.  The  average number of employees
  employed in an empire zone in  a  taxable  year  shall  be  computed  by
  ascertaining  the  number  of  such  employees  within  such zone except
  general executive officers, employed by the taxpayer on the thirty-first
  day of March, the thirtieth day of June, the thirtieth day of  September
  and  the  thirty-first  day  of  December in the taxable year, by adding
  together the number of employees ascertained on each of such  dates  and
  dividing the sum so obtained by the number of such above-mentioned dates
  occurring within the taxable year.
    (c)  Carryover.  In  no  event shall the credit herein provided for be
  allowed in an amount which will reduce the tax payable to less than  the
  fixed  dollar  minimum amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision
  one of section two hundred ten of this article. Provided, however,  that
  if the amount of credit allowable under this subdivision for any taxable
  year  reduces  the  tax to such amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays
  tax based on the fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of  credit  not
  deductible  in  such  taxable  year may be carried over to the following
  year or years and may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such  year
  or  years.  In  lieu  of  such  carryover,  any  such taxpayer, which is
  approved as the owner of a qualified investment project or a significant
  capital investment project pursuant to subdivision (v) of  section  nine
  hundred  fifty-nine  of  the  general  municipal  law, may elect, on its
  report for its taxable  year  with  respect  to  which  such  credit  is
  allowed,  to  treat  fifty percent of the amount of such carryover as an
  overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded  in  accordance  with  the
  provisions of section one thousand eighty-six of this chapter. Provided,
  however,  in the case of such owner of a qualified investment project or
  a significant capital investment project,  only  fifty  percent  of  the
  amount  of  such  carryover  which is attributable to the credit allowed
  under this subdivision with respect to property which is  part  of  such
  project shall be allowed to be credited or refunded and such owner shall
  be  allowed  such credit or refund only for those taxable years in which


 such owner would be allowed a  credit  or  refund  of  the  empire  zone
  investment  tax credit pursuant to paragraph (d) of subdivision three of
  this section. Provided, further, however, the provisions  of  subsection
  (c)   of   section   one   thousand   eighty-eight   of   this   chapter
  notwithstanding, no interest shall be paid thereon.
    (c-1) Any carryover of a credit from prior taxable years will  not  be
  allowed  if  an empire zone retention certificate is not issued pursuant
  to subdivision (w) of section nine hundred  fifty-nine  of  the  general
  municipal  law  to  the empire zone enterprise which is the basis of the
  credit.
    (d) Notwithstanding the expiration of the empire zones  program  under
  article  eighteen-B  of  the  general  municipal law, a taxpayer that is
  certified as a qualified investment project  pursuant  to  such  article
  eighteen-B  on  the  day  immediately preceding the day the empire zones
  program expired shall continue to be deemed certified under such article
  eighteen-B for purposes of this subdivision for  the  remainder  of  the
  taxable  year  in  which  the  expiration  occurred  and  for  the  next
  succeeding nine taxable years. In  addition,  the  areas  designated  as
  empire  zones  in  which  the  taxpayer  is  certified  as  a  qualified
  investment project on the day immediately preceding the day  the  empire
  zones  program  expired  shall  continue  to  be deemed empire zones for
  purposes of this subdivision for the remainder of the  taxable  year  in
  which  the  expiration occurred and for the next succeeding nine taxable
  years.
    (e) Notwithstanding the expiration of the empire zones  program  under
  article  eighteen-B  of the general municipal law and except as provided
  in paragraph (d) of this subdivision, a taxpayer that is certified as an
  empire zone business pursuant to such  article  eighteen-B  on  the  day
  immediately  preceding  the  day  the empire zones program expired shall
  continue to be deemed in the empire  zone  in  which  the  taxpayer  was
  certified  as  an  empire zone business on the day immediately preceding
  the day the empire zones program expired for each  of  the  three  years
  next  succeeding the taxable year for which the credit under subdivision
  three of this section is allowed.
    5. QEZE credit for real property taxes. (a)  Allowance  of  credit.  A
  taxpayer  which is a qualified empire zone enterprise shall be allowed a
  credit for eligible real property taxes, to be computed as  provided  in
  section  fifteen  of  this  chapter,  against  the  tax  imposed by this
  article.
    (b) Application of credit. The credit allowed under  this  subdivision
  for  any taxable year shall not reduce the tax due for such year to less
  than the fixed dollar minimum amount  prescribed  in  paragraph  (d)  of
  subdivision  one of section two hundred ten of this article. However, if
  the amount of credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year
  reduces the tax to such amount or if the  taxpayer  otherwise  pays  tax
  based  on the fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit thus not
  deductible in such taxable year shall be treated as  an  overpayment  of
  tax  to  be  credited  or  refunded in accordance with the provisions of
  section one thousand eighty-six of this chapter. Provided, however,  the
  provisions  of  subsection  (c)  of section one thousand eighty-eight of
  this chapter notwithstanding, no interest shall be paid thereon.
    6. QEZE tax reduction credit. (a)  Allowance  of  credit.  A  taxpayer
  which  is a qualified empire zone enterprise shall be allowed a QEZE tax
  reduction credit, to be computed as provided in section sixteen of  this
  chapter, against the tax imposed by this article.
    (b)  Application  of credit. The credit allowed under this subdivision
  for any taxable year shall not reduce the tax due for such year to  less
  than  the  fixed  dollar  minimum  amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of


 subdivision one of section two hundred ten of  this  article.  Provided,
  however,  this  paragraph  shall  not  apply  to  a taxpayer with a zone
  allocation factor of one hundred percent.
    7.  Qualified  emerging  technology  company  employment  credit.  (a)
  Application of credit. A taxpayer shall  be  allowed  a  credit,  to  be
  computed  as  hereinafter  provided,  against  the  tax  imposed by this
  article, provided:
    (i) the taxpayer is a qualified emerging technology  company  pursuant
  to  the  provisions  of  section  thirty-one hundred two-e of the public
  authorities law; and
    (ii) the average number of  individuals  employed  full  time  by  the
  taxpayer  in  New  York  state  during  the taxable year is at least one
  hundred one percent of the taxpayer's  base  year  employment.  For  the
  purposes  of  this subdivision, "base year employment" means the average
  number of individuals employed full-time by the taxpayer  in  the  state
  during  the  three taxable years immediately preceding the first taxable
  year in which  the  credit  is  claimed.  Where  the  taxpayer  provided
  full-time  employment  within  the  state  during only a portion of such
  three-year period, then the first effective date for the company to take
  advantage of this credit shall be the next year following the first full
  taxable year that the company  had  full-time  employment  in  New  York
  state.  For  the purposes of this paragraph the term "three years" shall
  be deemed to refer instead to  the  prior  year's  full-time  employment
  after  the  first  year  and  the average of the first eight quarters of
  employment after the first two taxable years in New York state.
    (b) Credit limitation. The credit shall be allowed only in  the  first
  taxable  year in which the credit is claimed and in each of the next two
  taxable years, provided that the conditions of  paragraph  (a)  of  this
  subdivision are satisfied in each taxable year.
    (c) Average number of individuals employed full-time. For the purposes
  of  this  subdivision,  average number of individuals employed full-time
  shall be computed by adding the number of such individuals  employed  by
  the  taxpayer  at  the  end  of each quarter during each taxable year or
  other applicable period and dividing the sum so obtained by  the  number
  of  such quarters occurring within such taxable year or other applicable
  period; provided however, except that in computing base year employment,
  there shall be excluded therefrom any employee with respect  to  whom  a
  credit  provided  for  under subdivision nineteen of section two hundred
  ten of this article, as such  subdivision  was  in  effect  on  December
  thirty-first, two thousand fourteen, was claimed for the taxable year.
    (d) Amount of credit. The amount of the credit shall equal the product
  of  one  thousand  dollars  times  the  number  of  individuals employed
  full-time by the taxpayer in the taxable year that are in excess of  one
  hundred percent of the taxpayer's base year employment.
    (e)  Carryover.  The  credit  allowed  under  this subdivision for any
  taxable year shall not reduce the tax due for such year to less than the
  fixed dollar minimum amount prescribed in paragraph (d)  of  subdivision
  one  of  section two hundred ten of this article. However, if the amount
  of credit allowed under this subdivision for any  taxable  year  reduces
  the  tax  to  such amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax based on
  the  fixed  dollar  minimum  amount,  any  amount  of  credit  thus  not
  deductible  in  such  taxable year shall be treated as an overpayment of
  tax to be credited or refunded in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
  section  one thousand eighty-six of this chapter. Provided, however, the
  provisions of subsection (c) of section  one  thousand  eighty-eight  of
  this chapter notwithstanding, no interest shall be paid thereon.
    8.  Qualified  emerging  technology  company  capital  tax credit. (a)
  Amount of credit. A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against  the  tax


 imposed  by this article. The amount of the credit shall be equal to one
  of the  following  percentages,  per  each  qualified  investment  in  a
  qualified  emerging  technology company as defined in section thirty-one
  hundred  two-e  of  the  public authorities law, made during the taxable
  year, and certified by the commissioner, either:
    (1)  ten  percent  of  qualified  investments  in  qualified  emerging
  technology  companies, except for investments made by or on behalf of an
  owner of the business, including, but not  limited  to,  a  stockholder,
  partner  or  sole  proprietor,  or  any  related  person,  as defined in
  subparagraph (C) of paragraph three of subsection (b)  of  section  four
  hundred  sixty-five of the internal revenue code, and provided, however,
  that the taxpayer certifies  to  the  commissioner  that  the  qualified
  investment  will not be sold, transferred, traded, or disposed of during
  the four years following the year in which the credit is first  claimed;
  or
    (2)  twenty  percent  of  qualified  investments in qualified emerging
  technology companies, except for investments made by or on behalf of  an
  owner  of  the  business,  including, but not limited to, a stockholder,
  partner or sole  proprietor,  or  any  related  person,  as  defined  in
  subparagraph  (C)  of  paragraph three of subsection (b) of section four
  hundred sixty-five of the internal revenue code, and provided,  however,
  that  the  taxpayer  certifies  to  the  commissioner that the qualified
  investment will not be sold, transferred, traded, or disposed of  during
  the nine years following the year in which the credit is first claimed.
    (b)   Qualified   investment.   "Qualified   investment"   means   the
  contribution of property to a corporation in exchange for original issue
  capital stock or other ownership interest, the contribution of  property
  to  a  partnership  in  exchange for an interest in the partnership, and
  similar contributions in the case of a business entity not in  corporate
  or  partnership  form  in  exchange  for  an  ownership interest in such
  entity.  The total amount of credit allowable to a taxpayer  under  this
  provision  for  all  years, taken in the aggregate, shall not exceed one
  hundred fifty thousand dollars in the case of investments made  pursuant
  to  subparagraph  one of paragraph (a) of this subdivision and shall not
  exceed three hundred thousand dollars in the case  of  investments  made
  pursuant to subparagraph two of paragraph (a) of this subdivision.
    (c)  Carryover.  In  no  event  shall the credit and carryover of such
  credit allowed under this subdivision  for  any  taxable  year,  in  the
  aggregate,  reduce  the  tax  due  for  such year to less than the fixed
  dollar minimum amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision one  of
  section  two  hundred  ten  of  this  chapter. However, if the amount of
  credit or carryovers  of  such  credit,  or  both,  allowed  under  this
  subdivision  for  any  taxable year reduces the tax to such amount or if
  the taxpayer otherwise pays  tax  based  on  the  fixed  dollar  minimum
  amount,  or  if  any part of the credit or carryovers of such credit may
  not be deducted from the tax  otherwise  due  by  reason  of  the  final
  sentence  of  this paragraph, any amount of credit or carryovers of such
  credit thus not deductible in such taxable year may be carried  over  to
  the  following  year  or years and may be deducted from the tax for such
  year or years. In addition, the amount of such credit, and carryovers of
  such credit to the taxable year, deducted from the tax otherwise due may
  not, in the aggregate, exceed fifty percent of  the  tax  imposed  under
  section  two hundred nine of this article computed without regard to any
  credit provided for by this section.
    (d) Recapture. (1) Where a  taxpayer  sells,  transfers  or  otherwise
  disposes  of  corporate stock, a partnership interest or other ownership
  interest arising from the making of a qualified investment which was the
  basis, in whole or in part, for the allowance of the credit provided for


 under subparagraph one of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, or where an
  investment which was the basis for such allowance is,  in  whole  or  in
  part,  recovered  by  such  taxpayer,  and  such disposition or recovery
  occurs  during  the  taxable  year or within forty-eight months from the
  close of the taxable year with respect to which such credit is  allowed,
  the  taxpayer  shall add back, with respect to the taxable year in which
  the disposition or  recovery  described  above  occurred,  the  required
  portion of the credit originally allowed.
    (2)  Where  a  taxpayer  sells,  transfers  or  otherwise  disposes of
  corporate stock, a partnership  interest  or  other  ownership  interest
  arising  from  the making of a qualified investment which was the basis,
  in whole or in part, for the allowance of the credit provided for  under
  subparagraph  two  of  paragraph  (a)  of  this subdivision, or where an
  investment which was the basis for such allowance is in any  manner,  in
  whole  or  in  part, recovered by such taxpayer, and such disposition or
  recovery occurs during the taxable year  or  within  one  hundred  eight
  months  from  the  close  of the taxable year with respect to which such
  credit is allowed, the taxpayer shall add  back,  with  respect  to  the
  taxable   year  in  which  the  disposition  or  recovery  described  in
  subparagraph one of this paragraph occurred the required portion of  the
  credit originally allowed.
    (3) The required portion of the credit originally allowed shall be the
  product  of  (A) the portion of such credit attributable to the property
  disposed of and (B) the applicable percentage.
    (4) The applicable percentage shall be:
    (A) for credits allowed pursuant to subparagraph one of paragraph  (a)
  of this subdivision:
    (i)  one hundred percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs within
  the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed  or  within
  twelve months of the end of such taxable year,
    (ii)  seventy-five percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs more
  than twelve but not more than twenty-four months after the  end  of  the
  taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed,
    (iii)  fifty  percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs more than
  twenty-four months but not more than thirty-six months after the end  of
  the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed, or
    (iv)  twenty-five  percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs more
  than thirty-six months but not more than forty-eight  months  after  the
  end of the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed; or
    (B)  for credits allowed pursuant to subparagraph two of paragraph (a)
  of this subdivision:
    (i) one hundred percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs  within
  the  taxable  year with respect to which the credit is allowed or within
  twelve months of the end of such taxable year,
    (ii) eighty percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs  more  than
  twelve but not more than forty-eight months after the end of the taxable
  year with respect to which the credit is allowed,
    (iii)  sixty  percent, if the disposition or recovery occurs more than
  forty-eight months but not more than seventy-two months after the end of
  the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed,
    (iv) forty percent, if the disposition or recovery  occurs  more  than
  seventy-two  months but not more than ninety-six months after the end of
  the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed, or
    (v) twenty percent, if the disposition or recovery  occurs  more  than
  ninety-six  months  but not more than one hundred eight months after the
  end of the taxable year with respect to which the credit is allowed.
    9. Credit for the special additional  mortgage  recording  tax.    (a)
  Application  of  credit.  A  taxpayer  shall  be allowed a credit, to be


 credited against the tax imposed by this article, equal to the amount of
  the special additional mortgage  recording  tax  paid  by  the  taxpayer
  pursuant  to  the provisions of subdivision one-a of section two hundred
  fifty-three of this chapter on mortgages recorded. Provided, however, no
  credit  shall  be  allowed  with  respect to a mortgage of real property
  principally improved or  to  be  improved  by  one  or  more  structures
  containing  in  the  aggregate  not  more  than six residential dwelling
  units, each dwelling unit having its own  separate  cooking  facilities,
  where  the  real  property  is  located  in  one or more of the counties
  comprising  the  metropolitan  commuter  transportation  area.  Provided
  further,  however, no credit shall be allowed with respect to a mortgage
  of real property principally improved or to be improved by one  or  more
  structures  containing  in  the  aggregate not more than six residential
  dwelling units, each dwelling  unit  having  its  own  separate  cooking
  facilities, where the real property is located in the county of Erie.
    (b)  Carryover or refund. In no event shall the credit herein provided
  for be allowed in an amount which will reduce the tax  payable  to  less
  than  the  fixed  dollar  minimum  amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of
  subdivision one of section two hundred ten of this article. If, however,
  the amount of credit allowable under this subdivision  for  any  taxable
  year,  including  any  credit  carried  over  from a prior taxable year,
  reduces the tax to such amount or if the  taxpayer  otherwise  pays  tax
  based  on  the  fixed  dollar  minimum  amount, any amount of credit not
  deductible in such taxable year may be carried  over  to  the  following
  year  or years and may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year
  or years. In lieu of carrying over to the following year or  years,  the
  unused  portion  of  credits  attributable  to  the  special  additional
  mortgage recording tax paid by the taxpayer as mortgagee with respect to
  mortgages of real property principally improved or to be improved by one
  or more structures  containing  in  the  aggregate  not  more  than  six
  residential  dwelling  units, each dwelling unit having its own separate
  cooking facilities, such taxpayer may elect to treat such unused portion
  as an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded in  accordance  with
  the provisions of section ten hundred eighty-six of this chapter, except
  that no interest shall be paid on such overpayment.
    10.  Credit  for  servicing  certain  mortgages.  (a)  General.  Every
  taxpayer meeting the requirements of the  state  of  New  York  mortgage
  agency  applicable to the servicing of mortgages acquired by such agency
  pursuant to the state of New York mortgage agency act, which shall  have
  entered  into  a  contract with the state of New York mortgage agency to
  service mortgages acquired by such agency pursuant to the state  of  New
  York  mortgage  agency act, shall have credited to it annually an amount
  equal to two and ninety-three one hundredths per  centum  of  the  total
  principal and interest collected by the taxpayer during its taxable year
  on  each  such  mortgage  secured by a lien on real estate improved by a
  one-family to four-family residential structure and an amount  equal  to
  the  interest  collected by the taxpayer during its taxable year on each
  such mortgage secured by a lien on real property improved by a structure
  occupied as the residence of five or more families living  independently
  of  each  other, multiplied by a fraction the denominator of which shall
  be the interest rate payable on the mortgage (computed to  five  decimal
  places) and the numerator of which shall be .00125 in the case of such a
  mortgage  acquired by such agency for less than one million dollars, and
  .00100 in the case of such a mortgage acquired by such  agency  for  one
  million dollars or more. In no event shall the credit allowed under this
  subdivision  reduce the tax to less than the fixed dollar minimum amount
  prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision one of  section  two  hundred
  ten  of  this article. In computing such tax credit for the servicing of


 mortgages on  one-family  to  four-family  residential  structures,  the
  taxpayer  shall  not  be  entitled  to  credit  for  the  collection  of
  curtailment or payments in discharge  of  any  such  mortgage.  For  the
  purposes of this subdivision,
    (b)(i) a "curtailment" shall mean amounts paid by mortgagors
    (A)  in  excess  of  the  monthly  constant  due  during  the month of
  collection and
    (B) in reduction of the unpaid principal balance of the  mortgage;  in
  the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, amounts paid in excess of
  the  monthly constant due during the month of collection shall be deemed
  to be in reduction of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage; and
    (ii) "monthly  constant"  shall  mean  the  amount  of  principal  and
  interest which is due and payable according to the mortgage documents on
  each periodic payment date.
    11.  Agricultural  property  tax credit. (a) General. In the case of a
  taxpayer which is an eligible farmer or an eligible farmer who has  paid
  taxes  pursuant  to a land contract, there shall be allowed a credit for
  the allowable school district property taxes. The term "allowable school
  district property taxes" means the school district property  taxes  paid
  during  the  taxable year on qualified agricultural property, subject to
  the acreage limitation provided in paragraph (e) of this subdivision and
  the income limitation provided in paragraph (f) of this subdivision.
    (b) Eligible farmer.  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  the  term
  "eligible  farmer"  means  a  taxpayer  whose  federal gross income from
  farming for the taxable year is at least two-thirds  of  excess  federal
  gross  income.  The  term  "eligible farmer" also includes a corporation
  other than the taxpayer of record for qualified agricultural land  which
  has  paid  the school district property taxes on such land pursuant to a
  contract for the future  purchase  of  such  land;  provided  that  such
  corporation has a federal gross income from farming for the taxable year
  which  is  at  least  two-thirds  of  excess  federal  gross income; and
  provided  further  that,  in  determining  such  income  eligibility,  a
  taxpayer  may,  for  any  taxable  year, use the average of such federal
  gross income from farming for that taxable year and such income for  the
  two  consecutive  taxable years immediately preceding such taxable year.
  Excess federal gross income means the amount  of  federal  gross  income
  from  all  sources  for  the  taxable  year in excess of thirty thousand
  dollars. For the purposes of this paragraph, payments from  the  state's
  farmland   protection   program,   administered  by  the  department  of
  agriculture and markets, shall be included as federal gross income  from
  farming for otherwise eligible farmers.
    (c)  School district property taxes. For purposes of this subdivision,
  the term "school district property  taxes"  means  all  property  taxes,
  special   ad  valorem  levies  and  special  assessments,  exclusive  of
  penalties and interest, levied  for  school  district  purposes  on  the
  qualified agricultural property owned by the taxpayer.
    (d) Qualified agricultural property. For purposes of this subdivision,
  the  term  "qualified  agricultural property" means land located in this
  state which is used in agricultural production, and  land  improvements,
  structures  and  buildings  (excluding buildings used for the taxpayer's
  residential purpose) located on such land which are used or occupied  to
  carry out such production. Qualified agricultural property also includes
  land  set  aside  or  retired  under a federal supply management or soil
  conservation program or land that at the time it becomes  subject  to  a
  conservation easement met the requirements under this paragraph.
    (e)  Acreage  limitation.  (i)  Eligible  taxes. In the event that the
  qualified agricultural property owned by the taxpayer includes  land  in
  excess  of the base acreage as provided in this paragraph, the amount of


 school  district  property  taxes  eligible  for   credit   under   this
  subdivision  shall be that portion of the school district property taxes
  which bears the same ratio to the total school district  property  taxes
  paid  during  the  taxable  year,  as  the  acreage allowable under this
  paragraph bears to the entire acreage of such land.
    (ii) Allowable acreage. The allowable acreage is the sum of  the  base
  acreage  set  forth  below and fifty percent of the incremental acreage.
  The incremental acreage is the excess of the entire acreage of qualified
  agricultural land owned by the taxpayer over the base acreage. Except as
  provided in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, the  base  acreage  is
  three hundred fifty acres.
  The  total  base  acreage  may  be  increased by any acreage enrolled or
  participating  during  the  taxable  year  in  a  federal  environmental
  conservation  acreage  reserve  program  pursuant  to title three of the
  federal agriculture improvement  and  reform  act  of  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-six.
    (iii)  Base  acreage of related persons. Where the taxpayer and one or
  more related persons each own qualified  agricultural  property  on  the
  first day of March of any year, the base acreage under subparagraph (ii)
  of  this  paragraph  shall  be  divided  equally  and allotted among the
  taxpayer and such related persons, and the taxpayer's base  acreage  for
  the taxable year which includes such March first shall be limited to its
  allotted  share. Provided, however, if the taxpayer and all such related
  persons consent (at such time and in such manner as the commissioner may
  prescribe) to an unequal division, the taxpayer's base acreage for  such
  taxable  year  shall be limited to its allotted share under such unequal
  division.
    (iv) Related persons. (A) For purposes of subparagraph (iii)  of  this
  paragraph, the term "related person" means:
    (I)  a  corporation  subject  to  tax  under  this  article, where the
  taxpayer and the corporation are members of the same  controlled  group,
  as defined in section 267(f) of the internal revenue code;
    (II)  an  individual,  partnership,  estate  or trust, where more than
  fifty percent in value of the  outstanding  stock  of  the  taxpayer  is
  owned,  directly  or indirectly, by or for such individual, partnership,
  estate or trust or by or for the grantor of such trust;
    (III)  a  corporation  subject  to  tax  under  this  article,  or   a
  partnership,  estate  or  trust, if the same person owns more than fifty
  percent in value of the outstanding stock of the taxpayer and more  than
  fifty  percent in value of  the outstanding stock of the corporation, or
  more than fifty percent of  the  capital  or  profits  interest  in  the
  partnership,  or  more  than fifty percent of the beneficial interest in
  the estate or trust;
    (IV) a partnership, estate  or  trust  of  which  the  taxpayer  owns,
  directly  or indirectly, more than fifty percent of the capital, profits
  or beneficial interest.
    (B) In determining whether a person is a  related  person  within  the
  meaning of this subparagraph:
    (I)  stock  owned,  directly  or  indirectly, by or for a corporation,
  partnership,  estate  or  trust  shall  be  considered  as  being  owned
  proportionately by or for its shareholders, partners or beneficiaries;
    (II)  an  individual  shall  be  considered as owning the stock owned,
  directly or indirectly, by or for his spouse;
    (III) stock  constructively  owned  by  a  person  by  reason  of  the
  application  of  item  (I)  of  this  clause  shall,  for the purpose of
  applying item (I) or (II) of this clause, be treated as  actually  owned
  by such person.


   (f)  Income  limitation. (i) In the event that the modified entire net
  income of  the  taxpayer  exceeds  two  hundred  thousand  dollars,  the
  allowable  school  district  property  taxes under paragraph (a) of this
  subdivision shall be  the  eligible  taxes  under  subparagraph  (i)  of
  paragraph  (e)  of this subdivision reduced by the product of the amount
  of  such  eligible  taxes  and  a  percentage,  such  percentage  to  be
  determined  by  multiplying  one  hundred  percent  by  a  fraction, the
  numerator of which is the lesser of one hundred thousand dollars or  the
  excess  of  the  taxpayer's  modified entire net income over two hundred
  thousand dollars and the denominator of which is  one  hundred  thousand
  dollars.  For  purposes  of  the  preceding sentence, the term "eligible
  taxes",  where  the  acreage  limitation  of  paragraph  (e)   of   this
  subdivision  does  not  apply,  shall  mean  the  total  school district
  property taxes paid during the taxable year.
    (ii) The term "modified entire net income" means the entire net income
  for the taxable year reduced by the amount of  principal  paid  on  farm
  indebtedness during the taxable year. The term "farm indebtedness" means
  debt incurred or refinanced which is secured by farm property, where the
  proceeds  of  the  debt  are  disbursed for expenditures incurred in the
  business of farming.
    (g) Carryover. In no event shall the credit provided herein be allowed
  in an amount which will reduce the tax payable to less  than  the  fixed
  dollar  minimum amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision one of
  section two hundred ten of this article.  If,  however,  the  amount  of
  credit allowable under this subdivision for any taxable year reduces the
  tax  to  such  amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax based on the
  fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit not deductible in such
  taxable year may be carried over to the following year or years and  may
  be  deducted  from  the taxpayer's tax for such year or years. Provided,
  however, in lieu of carrying over the unused portion of such credit, the
  taxpayer may elect to treat such unused portion as an overpayment of tax
  to be credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of  section
  one thousand eighty-six of this chapter except that no interest shall be
  paid on such overpayment.
    (h)  Nonqualified  use. (i) No credit in conversion year. In the event
  that qualified agricultural property is converted  by  the  taxpayer  to
  nonqualified  use,  credit  under  this subdivision shall not be allowed
  with respect to such property for the taxable year  of  conversion  (the
  conversion year).
    (ii)  Credit recapture. If the conversion by the taxpayer of qualified
  agricultural property to nonqualified use occurs during  the  period  of
  the  two  taxable  years following the taxable year for which the credit
  under this subdivision was first claimed with respect to such  property,
  the  credit  allowed with respect to such property for the taxable years
  prior to the conversion year must be added back in the conversion  year.
  Where  the property converted includes land, and where the conversion is
  of only a portion of such land, the credit allowed with respect  to  the
  property  converted shall be determined by multiplying the entire credit
  under this subdivision for the taxable years  prior  to  the  conversion
  year  by a fraction, the numerator of which is the acreage converted and
  the denominator of which is the entire acreage of such land owned by the
  taxpayer immediately prior to the conversion.
    (iii) Exception to recapture.  Subparagraph  (ii)  of  this  paragraph
  shall not apply to the conversion of property where the conversion is by
  reason  of  involuntary  conversion,  within  the meaning of section one
  thousand thirty-three of the internal revenue code.


   (iv) Conversion to nonqualified use. For purposes of this paragraph, a
  sale or other disposition of qualified agricultural property alone shall
  not constitute a conversion to a nonqualified use.
    (i) Special rules. For purposes of this subdivision, the term "federal
  gross   income  from  farming"  shall  include  gross  income  from  the
  production of maple syrup, cider, Christmas trees derived from a managed
  Christmas tree operation whether dug for transplanting or cut  from  the
  stump,  or  from  a  commercial  horse  boarding operation as defined in
  subdivision thirteen of section three hundred one of the agriculture and
  markets law, or from the sale of wine from a  licensed  farm  winery  as
  provided  for  in  article six of the alcoholic beverage control law, or
  from the sale of cider from a licensed farm cidery as  provided  for  in
  section fifty-eight-c of the alcoholic beverage control law.
    (j)  Election  to  deem  gross  income  of  New  York C corporation to
  shareholders. For purposes of this  subdivision,  federal  gross  income
  from  farming  shall  be  zero  for  any  taxable  year  of a New York C
  corporation for which the election under paragraph  nine  of  subsection
  (n) of section six hundred six of this chapter is in effect.
    12.  Credit for employment of persons with disabilities. (a) Allowance
  of credit. A taxpayer shall be allowed  a  credit,  to  be  computed  as
  hereinafter  provided,  against  the  tax  imposed  by this article, for
  employing within the state a qualified employee.
    (b) Qualified employee. A qualified employee is an individual:
    (1) who is certified by the education department, or in the case of an
  individual who is blind or visually handicapped,  by  the  state  agency
  responsible  for  provision of vocational rehabilitation services to the
  blind and visually handicapped: (i) as a person with a disability  which
  constitutes  or results in a substantial handicap to employment and (ii)
  as having completed or as receiving  services  under  an  individualized
  written  rehabilitation  plan  approved  by  the education department or
  other state agency responsible for providing  vocational  rehabilitation
  services to such individual; and
    (2)  who  has  worked  on  a  full-time  basis for the employer who is
  claiming the credit for at least one hundred eighty days or four hundred
  hours.
    (c) Amount of credit. Except as provided  in  paragraph  (d)  of  this
  subdivision,  the  amount  of credit shall be thirty-five percent of the
  first six thousand dollars in qualified first-year wages earned by  each
  qualified  employee.  "Qualified  first-year  wages" means wages paid or
  incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year to qualified  employees
  which  are  attributable, with respect to any such employee, to services
  rendered during the one-year period beginning with the day the  employee
  begins work for the taxpayer.
    (d)  Credit  where  federal  work opportunity tax credit applies. With
  respect to any qualified employee whose qualified first-year wages under
  paragraph (c) of this subdivision also constitute  qualified  first-year
  wages  for  purposes  of  the work opportunity tax credit for vocational
  rehabilitation referrals under section fifty-one of the internal revenue
  code, the amount of credit under  this subdivision shall be  thirty-five
  percent of the first six thousand dollars in qualified second-year wages
  earned  by each such employee. "Qualified second-year wages" means wages
  paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable  year  to  qualified
  employees  which are attributable, with respect to any such employee, to
  services rendered during the one-year period beginning  one  year  after
  the employee begins work for the taxpayer.
    (e)  Carryover.  The  credit  allowed  under  this subdivision for any
  taxable year shall not reduce the tax due for such year to less than the
  fixed dollar minimum amount prescribed in paragraph (d)  of  subdivision


 one  of  section two hundred ten of this chapter. However, if the amount
  of credit allowable under this subdivision for any taxable year  reduces
  the  tax  to  such amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax based on
  the  fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit not deductible in
  such taxable year may be carried over to the following  year  or  years,
  and may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years.
    (f)  Coordination  with  federal  work  opportunity  tax  credit.  The
  provisions of section fifty-one and fifty-two of  the  internal  revenue
  code,  as  such  sections  applied  on  October  first, nineteen hundred
  ninety-six, that apply to the federal work opportunity  tax  credit  for
  vocational rehabilitation referrals shall apply to the credit under this
  subdivision  to  the  extent  that such sections are consistent with the
  specific provisions of this subdivision, provided that in the event of a
  conflict the provisions of this subdivision shall control.
    13. Credit for purchase of  an  automated  external  defibrillator.  A
  taxpayer  shall  be  allowed  a  credit,  to  be computed as hereinafter
  provided, against the tax imposed by this  article,  for  the  purchase,
  other  than  for resale, of an automated external defibrillator, as such
  term is defined in section three thousand-b of the  public  health  law.
  The  amount  of  credit  shall  be the cost to the taxpayer of automated
  external defibrillators purchased during the taxable year,  such  credit
  not  to exceed five hundred dollars with respect to each unit purchased.
  The credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year shall not
  reduce the tax due for such year to less than the fixed  dollar  minimum
  amount  prescribed  in  paragraph  (d) of subdivision one of section two
  hundred ten of this chapter.
    14. Credit for purchase of long-term care insurance.  (a)  General.  A
  taxpayer  shall  be  allowed  a  credit  against the tax imposed by this
  article equal to twenty percent of the premium paid during  the  taxable
  year  for long-term care insurance. In order to qualify for such credit,
  the taxpayer's premium payment must  be  for  the  purchase  of  or  for
  continuing  coverage  under  a  long-term  care  insurance  policy  that
  qualifies for such credit pursuant to section one thousand  one  hundred
  seventeen of the insurance law.
    (b)  Carryover. The credit allowed under this subdivision for any year
  shall not reduce the tax due for such year to less than the fixed dollar
  minimum amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision one of section
  two hundred ten of this article.  If,  however,  the  amount  of  credit
  allowable under this subdivision for any taxable year reduces the tax to
  such  amount  or  if  the taxpayer otherwise pays tax based on the fixed
  dollar minimum amount, any amount  of  credit  not  deductible  in  such
  taxable  year may be carried over to the following year or years and may
  be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years.
    15. Low-income housing credit. (a) Allowance  of  credit.  A  taxpayer
  shall  be  allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this article with
  respect to the ownership of eligible low-income buildings,  computed  as
  provided in section eighteen of this chapter.
    (b)  Application  of  credit. The credit and carryovers of such credit
  allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year shall  not,  in  the
  aggregate,  reduce  the  tax  due  for  such year to less than the fixed
  dollar minimum amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision one  of
  section  two  hundred  ten  of  this  article. However, if the amount of
  credit or carryovers  of  such  credit,  or  both,  allowed  under  this
  subdivision  for  any  taxable year reduces the tax to such amount or if
  the taxpayer otherwise pays  tax  based  on  the  fixed  dollar  minimum
  amount,  any  amount  of  credit  or  carryovers of such credit thus not
  deductible in such taxable year may be carried  over  to  the  following
  year or years and may be deducted from the tax for such year or years.

  reduce the tax due for such year to less than the fixed  dollar  minimum
  amount  prescribed  in  paragraph  (d) of subdivision one of section two
  hundred ten of this  article.  However,  if  the  amount  of  credit  or
  carryovers  of  such credit, or both, allowed under this subdivision for
  any taxable year reduces the tax to  such  amount  or  if  the  taxpayer
  otherwise  pays tax based on the fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount
  of credit or carryovers of such  credit  thus  not  deductible  in  such
  taxable  year may be carried over to the following year or years and may
  be deducted from the tax for such year or years.
    17. Brownfield redevelopment tax credit. (a) Allowance  of  credit.  A
  taxpayer  shall  be  allowed  a  credit,  to  be computed as provided in

  for any taxable year shall not reduce the tax due for such year to  less
  than  the  fixed  dollar  minimum  amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of
  subdivision one of section two hundred ten of this article. However,  if
  the  amount  of  credits  allowed under this subdivision for any taxable
  year reduces the tax to such amount or if the  taxpayer  otherwise  pays
  tax  based on the fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit thus
  not deductible in such taxable year shall be treated as  an  overpayment
  of  tax  to be credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of
  section one thousand eighty-six of this chapter. Provided, however,  the
  provisions  of  subsection  (c)  of section one thousand eighty-eight of

  treated as  an  overpayment  of  tax  to  be  credited  or  refunded  in
  accordance  with  the  provisions  of section one thousand eighty-six of


 this chapter. Provided, however, the provisions  of  subsection  (c)  of

  amount,  any  amount  of credit thus not deductible in such taxable year

  to  be computed as hereinafter provided, shall be allowed for bioheating
  fuel, used for space heating or hot  water  production  for  residential
  purposes  within this state purchased before January first, two thousand
  twenty-six. Such credit shall be $0.01  per  percent  of  biodiesel  per
  gallon  of  bioheating  fuel,  not  to  exceed  twenty cents per gallon,
  purchased by such taxpayer.  Provided, however, that on or after January
  first, two thousand seventeen, this credit shall not apply to bioheating
  fuel that is less than six percent biodiesel per  gallon  of  bioheating
  fuel.
    (b)  Definitions.  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision, the following
  definitions shall apply:
    (i) "Biodiesel" shall mean a fuel comprised exclusively of  mono-alkyl
  esters  of  long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal
  fats, designated  B100,  which  meets  the  specifications  of  American

  for any taxable year shall not reduce the tax due for such year to  less
  than  the  fixed  dollar  minimum  amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of
  subdivision one of section two hundred ten of this article. However,  if
  the amount of credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year
  reduces  the  tax  to  such amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax
  based on the fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit thus  not
  deductible  in  such  taxable year shall be treated as an overpayment of
  tax to be credited or refunded in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
  section  one thousand eighty-six of this chapter. Provided, however, the
  provisions of subsection (c) of section  one  thousand  eighty-eight  of
  this chapter notwithstanding, no interest shall be paid thereon.


   26. Credit for rehabilitation of historic properties.  (a) Application

  tax  imposed  by this article, in an amount equal to one hundred percent
  of the amount of credit allowed the taxpayer for the same  taxable  year
  with  respect  to  a certified historic structure, and one hundred fifty
  percent of the amount of credit allowed the taxpayer with respect  to  a
  certified  historic  structure  that  is a small project, under internal
  revenue code section 47(c)(3),  determined  without  regard  to  ratably
  allocating  the credit over a five year period as required by subsection
  (a) of such section 47, with respect to a certified  historic  structure
  located within the state. Provided, however, the credit shall not exceed
  five million dollars.
    (ii)  For  taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after January first, two
  thousand thirty, a taxpayer shall be allowed  a  credit  as  hereinafter
  provided, against the tax imposed by this article, in an amount equal to
  thirty percent of the amount of credit allowed the taxpayer for the same
  taxable  year determined without regard to ratably allocating the credit
  over a five year period as required by subsection (a) of section  47  of
  the  internal  revenue  code,  with  respect  to  a  certified  historic
  structure under subsection (c)(3) of section 47 of the internal  revenue
  code  with  respect to a certified historic structure located within the
  state. Provided, however,  the  credit  shall  not  exceed  one  hundred
  thousand dollars.
    (a-1)  If  the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership or a shareholder
  in a New York S corporation, then the credit caps imposed  in  paragraph
  (a)  of  this  subdivision shall be applied at the entity level, so that
  the aggregate credit allowed to all the partners or shareholders of each
  such entity in the taxable year does not exceed the credit cap  that  is
  applicable in that taxable year.
    (b)  Tax credits allowed pursuant to this subdivision shall be allowed
  in the taxable year that  the  qualified  rehabilitation  is  placed  in
  service under section 167 of the federal internal revenue code.
    (c)  If the taxpayer is allowed a credit pursuant to section 47 of the
  internal revenue code with respect to a qualified rehabilitation that is
  also the subject of the credit allowed  by  this  subdivision  and  that
  credit  pursuant to such section 47 is recaptured pursuant to subsection
  (a) of section 50 of the internal revenue code, a portion of the  credit
  allowed  under  this  subdivision must be added back in the same taxable
  year and in the same proportion as the federal credit.
    (d) The credit allowed under this subdivision  for  any  taxable  year
  shall  not  reduce  the  tax  due  for such year to less than the amount
  prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision one of  section  two  hundred
  ten  of this article. However, if the amount of the credit allowed under
  this subdivision for any taxable year reduces the tax to such amount  or
  if  the  taxpayer  otherwise  pays tax based on the fixed dollar minimum
  amount, any amount of credit thus not deductible in  such  taxable  year
  shall  be  treated as an overpayment of tax to be recredited or refunded
  in accordance with the provisions of section one thousand eighty-six  of
  this  chapter.  Provided,  however,  the provisions of subsection (c) of
  section one thousand eighty-eight of this  chapter  notwithstanding,  no
  interest shall be paid thereon.
    (e)   Except  in  the  case  of  a  qualified  rehabilitation  project
  undertaken within a state park, state historic site, or other land owned
  by the state, that is under the jurisdiction of  the  office  of  parks,
  recreation  and  historic  preservation,  to  be eligible for the credit
  allowable under this subdivision, the rehabilitation project shall be in


 whole or in part located within a census tract which  is  identified  as
  being  at or below one hundred percent of the state median family income
  as calculated as of April first of each year using the most recent  five
  year estimate from the American community survey published by the United
  States  Census bureau. If there is a change in the most recent five year
  estimate, a census tract  that  qualified  for  eligibility  under  this
  program  before  information  about  the change was released will remain
  eligible for a credit under  this  subdivision  for  an  additional  two
  calendar years.
    (f)  For  purposes of this subdivision "small project" means qualified
  rehabilitation expenditures totaling two million five  hundred  thousand
  dollars or less.
    27.  Credits  of New York S corporations. (a) General. Notwithstanding
  the provisions of this section, no carryover of credit  allowable  in  a
  New  York C year shall be deducted from the tax otherwise due under this
  article in a New York S year, and no credit allowable in a  New  York  S
  year,  or  carryover  of  such  credit,  shall  be deducted from the tax
  imposed by this article. However, a New York S year shall be treated  as
  a  taxable  year for purposes of determining the number of taxable years
  to  which  a  credit  may  be   carried   over   under   this   section.
  Notwithstanding  the  first  sentence  of this subdivision, however, the
  credit for the  special  additional  mortgage  recording  tax  shall  be
  allowed  as  provided  in  subdivision  nine  of  this  section, and the
  carryover of any such credit  shall  be  determined  without  regard  to
  whether  the  credit  is  carried from a New York C year to a New York S
  year or vice-versa.
    29. Hire a vet credit.   (a) Allowance of credit.  For  taxable  years
  beginning  on  or  after  January first, two thousand fifteen and before
  January first, two thousand twenty-six, a taxpayer shall  be  allowed  a
  credit,  to be computed as provided in this subdivision, against the tax
  imposed by this article, for hiring and employing,  for  not  less  than
  twelve  continuous  and uninterrupted months (hereinafter referred to as
  the twelve-month  period)  in  a  full-time  or  part-time  position,  a
  qualified veteran within the state. The taxpayer may claim the credit in
  the  year  in  which  the  qualified  veteran completes the twelve-month
  period of employment by the taxpayer. If the taxpayer claims the  credit
  allowed under this subdivision, the taxpayer may not use the hiring of a
  qualified  veteran that is the basis for this credit in the basis of any
  other credit allowed under this article.
    (b) Qualified veteran. A qualified veteran is an individual:
    (1) who served on active duty in the United  States  army,  navy,  air
  force,  space  force, marine corps, coast guard or the reserves thereof,

  her employment by the taxpayer.
    (c)  Employer prohibition. An employer shall not discharge an employee
  and hire a qualifying veteran solely for the purpose of  qualifying  for
  this credit.
    (d)  Amount  of  credit.  The  amount  of  the credit shall be fifteen
  percent of the total amount of  wages  paid  to  the  qualified  veteran

  defined  in  paragraph  (b) of subdivision one of section eighty-five of
  the civil service law, the amount of the credit shall be twenty  percent
  of  the  total  amount of wages paid to the qualified veteran during the

  hundred  dollars  for  any  qualified  veteran,  other  than  a disabled

  forty  hours but not more than one thousand eight hundred nineteen hours
  in one twelve-month  period,  and  (4)  ten  thousand  dollars  for  any

  taxable year shall not reduce the tax due for such year to less than the
  amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision  one  of  section  two
  hundred  ten of this article. However, if the amount of credit allowable
  under this subdivision for any taxable year  reduces  the  tax  to  such
  amount  or  if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax based on the fixed dollar
  minimum amount, any amount of credit not deductible in such taxable year
  may be carried over to the following three years  and  may  be  deducted
  from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years.
    30. Alternative fuels and electric vehicle recharging property credit.

    (b) (i) Alternative  fuel  vehicle  refueling  property  and  electric
  vehicle  recharging  property.  The  credit  under  this subdivision for
  alternative  fuel  vehicle  refueling  property  and  electric   vehicle
  recharging  property  shall  equal for each installation of property the
  lesser of five thousand dollars or the product of fifty percent and  the
  cost  of  any  such  property  less  any costs paid from the proceeds of
  grants.
    (ii) To qualify for the credit, the property must:

  allowed  in an amount which will reduce the tax payable to less than the
  amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision  one  of  section  two
  hundred  ten  of  this article. Provided, however, that if the amount of
  credit allowable under this subdivision for any taxable year reduces the
  tax to such amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax  based  on  the
  fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit not deductible in such
  taxable  year may be carried over to the following year or years and may
  be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years.
    (e) Credit recapture. If, at any time before the end of  its  recovery
  period,   alternative   fuel   vehicle  refueling  or  electric  vehicle
  recharging property ceases to be qualified, a recapture amount  must  be
  added back in the year in which such cessation occurs.
    (i)  Alternative  fuel  vehicle refueling property or electric vehicle
  recharging property ceases to be qualified if:
    (I) the property no  longer  qualifies  as  alternative  fuel  vehicle
  refueling property or electric vehicle recharging property; or
    (II)  fifty  percent  or  more of the use of the property in a taxable
  year is other than in a trade or business in this state; or

  this subparagraph.
    (ii)  Recapture  amount.  The  recapture amount is equal to the credit
  allowable under this subdivision multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
  of which is the total recovery period for the property minus the  number
  of  recovery  years prior to, but not including, the recapture year, and
  the denominator of which is the total recovery period.
    (f)  Termination.  The  credit  allowed  by  paragraph  (b)  of   this
  subdivision  shall  not  apply in taxable years beginning after December
  thirty-first, two thousand twenty-five.

  credit  allowed  under this subdivision for any taxable year reduces the
  tax to such amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax  based  on  the
  fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit thus not deductible in
  such  taxable  year  will  be  treated  as  an  overpayment of tax to be
  credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions  of  section  one
  thousand  eighty-six  of this chapter. Provided, however, the provisions
  of subsection (c) of section one thousand eighty-eight of  this  chapter

  amount  of  the  credit allowable under this subdivision for any taxable
  year reduces the tax to such amount or if the  taxpayer  otherwise  pays
  tax  based  on  the  fixed  dollar  minimum amount, fifty percent of the

  refunded  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of section one thousand
  eighty-six  of  this  chapter.  Provided,  however,  the  provisions  of

  credit  not credited or refunded in such taxable year may be a carryover
  to the immediately succeeding taxable year and may be deducted from  the
  taxpayer's  tax  for such year. The excess, if any, of the amount of the
  credit over the tax for such succeeding year  shall  be  treated  as  an
  overpayment  of  tax  to  be credited or refunded in accordance with the
  provisions of section one thousand eighty-six of this chapter. Provided,
  however, the provisions  of  subsection  (c)  of  section  one  thousand

  fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit thus not deductible in
  such taxable year may be carried over to the following year or years and

  section  two  hundred  ten  of  this article. If, however, the amount of
  credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year  reduces  the

  credited  or  refunded  in accordance with the provisions of section one
  thousand  eighty-six  of this chapter. Provided, however, the provisions
  of subsection (c) of section one thousand eighty-eight of  this  chapter

  pursuant  to  section  twenty-five-a  of  the  labor law and received an
  annual final certificate of tax credit from such commissioner  shall  be
  allowed  a  credit  against the tax imposed by this article equal to the
  amount listed on the annual final certificate of tax  credit  issued  by

  employer shall be entitled to claim the  credit  as  calculated  on  the
  annual  final  certificate of tax credit on the calendar year return for
  which the annual final certificate of tax  credit  was  issued.  If  the
  qualified  employer's  taxable year is a fiscal year, the employer shall
  be entitled to claim the  credit  as  calculated  on  the  annual  final
  certificate  of  tax  credit  on  the  return  for  the fiscal year that
  encompasses the date on which the annual final certificate of tax credit
  is issued. For the purposes of this  subdivision,  the  term  "qualified

  section twenty-five-a of the labor law.
    (b) The credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year may
  not  reduce the tax due for that year to less than the amount prescribed
  in paragraph (d) of subdivision one of section two hundred ten  of  this

  subdivision for any taxable year reduces the tax to that  amount  or  if
  the  taxpayer  otherwise  pays  tax  based  on  the fixed dollar minimum
  amount, any amount of credit not deductible in that taxable year will be
  treated as  an  overpayment  of  tax  to  be  credited  or  refunded  in
  accordance  with  the  provisions  of section one thousand eighty-six of
  this chapter. Provided, however, no interest will be paid thereon.
    (c) The taxpayer shall be required to attach to  its  tax  return  its
  annual  final  certificate  of  tax credit issued by the commissioner of
  labor pursuant to section twenty-five-a of the labor law.  In  no  event
  shall  the  taxpayer  be allowed a credit greater than the amount of the
  credit  listed  on  the  annual  final  certificate   of   tax   credit.
  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this  chapter  to the contrary, the
  commissioner and the commissioner's designees may release the names  and
  addresses  of  any  taxpayer  claiming this credit and the amount of the
  credit earned by the taxpayer. Provided, however, if a  taxpayer  claims
  this  credit  because it is a member of a limited liability company or a
  partner in a partnership, only the amount of credit earned by the entity
  and not the amount of credit claimed by the taxpayer may be released.
    37. Empire state jobs  retention  program  credit.  (a)  Allowance  of

  credit  allowed  under this subdivision for any taxable year reduces the
  tax to such amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax  based  on  the
  fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit thus not deductible in
  such  taxable  year  will  be  treated  as  an  overpayment of tax to be


 credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions  of  section  one
  thousand  eighty-six  of this chapter. Provided, however, the provisions
  of subsection (c) of section one thousand eighty-eight of  this  chapter
  notwithstanding, no interest will be paid thereon.
    38.  Credit  for  companies  who provide transportation to individuals
  with disabilities.  (a) Allowance and amount of credit. A taxpayer,  who

  law, shall be allowed a credit, to  be  computed  as  provided  in  this
  subdivision,  against the tax imposed by this article. The amount of the
  credit shall be equal to the incremental cost associated with  upgrading
  a  vehicle  so that it is accessible by individuals with disabilities as
  defined in paragraph (b) of this subdivision.  Provided,  however,  that
  such  credit  shall  not  exceed  fifteen  thousand dollars per electric
  vehicle and ten thousand dollars per any other vehicle. For purposes  of
  this   subdivision,   purchases  of  new  vehicles  that  are  initially
  manufactured to be accessible for individuals with disabilities and  for
  which  there  is  no comparable make and model that does not include the
  equipment  necessary  to  provide  accessibility  to  individuals   with
  disabilities,  the credit shall be fifteen thousand dollars per electric
  vehicle and ten thousand dollars per any other vehicle.
    (b)  Definitions.   The   term   "accessible   by   individuals   with

  Federal  Regulations,  title  49,  parts 37 and 38 and the Federal Motor
  Vehicle Safety Standards, Code of Federal Regulations,  title  49,  part

  subdivision, have the same meaning as  in  section  sixty-six-s  of  the

  this subdivision for any taxable year reduce the tax due for  such  year
  to  less  than the amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision one
  of section two hundred ten of this article. However, if  the  amount  of
  credit  allowed  under this subdivision for any taxable year reduces the
  tax to such amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax  based  on  the
  fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit thus not deductible in
  such  taxable year shall be carried over to the following year or years,
  and may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years.  The
  tax  credit  allowed  pursuant  to  this  subdivision shall not apply to
  taxable  years  beginning  on  or  after  January  first,  two  thousand
  twenty-nine.
    39.  Alcoholic beverage production credit. A taxpayer shall be allowed
  a credit, to be computed as provided in  section  thirty-seven  of  this

  credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable  year  reduce  the
  tax  due  for  such year to less than the amount prescribed in paragraph
  (d) of subdivision one of section  two  hundred  ten  of  this  article.
  However,  if the amount of credit allowed under this subdivision for any
  taxable year reduces the tax to such amount or if the taxpayer otherwise
  pays tax based on the fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of  credit
  thus  not  deductible  in  such  taxable  year  shall  be  treated as an
  overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded  in  accordance  with  the
  provisions of section one thousand eighty-six of this chapter. Provided,
  however,  the  provisions  of  subsection  (c)  of  section one thousand


 eighty-eight of this chapter notwithstanding, no interest shall be  paid
  thereon.

  for  any  taxable  year may not reduce the tax due for such year to less
  than the amount prescribed  in  paragraph  (d)  of  subdivision  one  of
  section  two  hundred  ten  of  this  article. However, if the amount of
  credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year  reduces  the
  tax  to  such  amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax based on the
  fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit thus not deductible in
  such taxable year will be  treated  as  an  overpayment  of  tax  to  be
  credited  or  refunded  in accordance with the provisions of section one
  thousand eighty-six of this chapter. Provided, however,  the  provisions
  of  subsection  (c) of section one thousand eighty-eight of this chapter
  notwithstanding, no interest will be paid thereon.
    41. The tax-free NY area tax elimination credit. A taxpayer  shall  be
  allowed  a  credit  to  be computed as provided in section forty of this
  chapter, against the tax imposed by this article.  Unless  the  taxpayer
  has  a  tax-free  NY  area allocation factor of one hundred percent, the
  credit allowed under this subdivision for any  taxable  year  shall  not
  reduce  the  tax due for such year to less than the amount prescribed in
  paragraph (d) of subdivision one of section  two  hundred  ten  of  this
  article.  However,  if  the  amount  of  the credit allowable under this
  subdivision for any taxable year reduces the tax to such  amount  or  if
  the  taxpayer  otherwise  pays  tax  based  on  the fixed dollar minimum
  amount, any amount of credit not deductible in such taxable  year  shall
  be  treated  as  an  overpayment  of  tax  to be credited or refunded in
  accordance with the provisions of section  one  thousand  eighty-six  of
  this  chapter.  Provided,  however,  the provisions of subsection (c) of
  section one thousand eighty-eight of this  chapter  notwithstanding,  no
  interest shall be paid thereon.
    42.  Alternative  base credit. (a) If the tax imposed on a taxpayer by
  subdivision one of section two hundred  nine  of  this  article  is  the
  amount prescribed in clause (ii) of subparagraph one of paragraph (b) of
  subdivision one of section two hundred ten of this article, the taxpayer
  shall  be  allowed  a  credit against the tax imposed under this article
  equal to the amount of tax paid to another state computed on a tax  base
  identical  to  the tax base prescribed in such paragraph (b). If the tax
  imposed on a taxpayer by subdivision one of section two hundred nine  of
  this  article  is  the  highest  amount  prescribed  in paragraph (d) of
  subdivision one of section two hundred ten of this article applicable to
  the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall be allowed a  credit  against  the  tax
  imposed  under  this  article equal to the amount of tax paid to another
  state computed on a tax base identical to the  tax  base  prescribed  in
  such paragraph (d).
    (b)  In  no  event shall the credit allowed under this subdivision for
  any taxable year reduce the tax due for  such  year  to  less  than  the
  amount  prescribed  in  paragraph  (d) of subdivision one of section two
  hundred ten of this article. However, if the amount  of  credit  allowed
  under  this  subdivision  for  any  taxable year reduces the tax to such
  amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax based on the  fixed  dollar
  minimum amount, any amount of credit thus not deductible in such taxable
  year  shall  be  carried over to the following year or years, and may be
  deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such year or years.


   43. Real property tax credit for manufacturers. (a)  A  qualified  New
  York  manufacturer,  as defined in subparagraph (vi) of paragraph (a) of
  subdivision one of section two hundred ten  of  this  article,  will  be
  allowed  a  credit  equal  to twenty percent of the real property tax it
  paid   during   the  taxable  year  for  real  property  owned  by  such
  manufacturer in New York which was principally used during  the  taxable
  year for manufacturing to the extent not deducted in determining  entire
  net  income.  This credit will not be allowed if the real property taxes
  that are the basis for this credit are included in  the  calculation  of
  another credit claimed by the taxpayer.
    (b)  (1)  For purposes of this subdivision, the term real property tax
  means a charge imposed upon real property by or on behalf of  a  county,
  city,  town, village or school district for municipal or school district
  purposes, provided that the charge is  levied  for  the  general  public
  welfare  by  the  proper  taxing  authorities at a like rate against all
  property over which such authorities  have  jurisdiction,  and  provided
  that  where taxes are levied pursuant to article eighteen or nineteen of
  the real property tax law, the property must have been taxed at the rate
  determined for the class in which it is contained, as provided  by  such
  article  eighteen  or  nineteen,  whichever is applicable. The term real
  property tax does not include a charge for local benefits, including any
  portion  of  that  charge  that  is  properly  allocated  to  the  costs
  attributable  to  maintenance or interest, when (i) the property subject
  to the charge is limited to the property that benefits from the  charge,
  or  (ii)  the  amount  of the charge is determined by the benefit to the
  property assessed, or (iii) the improvement  for  which  the  charge  is
  assessed tends to increase the property value.
    (2) In addition, the term real property tax includes taxes paid by the
  taxpayer  upon real property principally used during the taxable year by
  the taxpayer in  manufacturing  where  the  taxpayer  leases  such  real
  property  from  an unrelated third party if the following conditions are
  satisfied: (i) the tax must be paid by the taxpayer as  lessee  pursuant
  to  explicit  requirements  in a written lease, and (ii) the taxpayer as
  lessee has paid such taxes directly to  the  taxing  authority  and  has
  received  a  written  receipt  for  payment  of  taxes  from  the taxing
  authority. In the case of a combined group that constitutes a  qualified
  New  York  manufacturer,  the  conditions  in the preceding sentence are
  satisfied if one corporation in the combined group  is  the  lessee  and
  another  corporation  in  the  combined  group makes the payments to the
  taxing authority. In the case of a taxpayer  that,  during  the  taxable
  year,  is  principally  engaged  in  the production of goods by farming,
  agriculture,  horticulture,  floriculture,  viticulture,  or  commercial
  fishing,  the  taxpayer  is  eligible  if  the  taxpayer  satisfies  the
  conditions stipulated in this subdivision and the taxpayer  leases  such
  real property from a related or unrelated party.
    (3)  The term real property tax does not include a payment made by the
  taxpayer in connection with an agreement for  the  payment  in  lieu  of
  taxes  on real property, whether such property is owned or leased by the
  taxpayer.
    (4) The real property taxes must be paid by the taxpayer in  the  year
  such taxes become a lien on the real property.
    (c)  Credit  recapture. Where a qualified New York manufacturer's real
  property taxes which were the basis for  the  allowance  of  the  credit
  provided for under this subdivision are subsequently reduced as a result
  of  a  final  order  in  any  proceeding under article seven of the real
  property tax law or other provision of law, the taxpayer shall add back,
  in the taxable year in which such final order is issued, the  excess  of
  (1)  the amount of credit originally allowed for a taxable year over (2)


 the amount of credit determined based upon  the  reduced  real  property
  taxes. If such final order reduces real property taxes for more than one
  year,  the  taxpayer  must  determine  how  much  of  such  reduction is
  attributable  to each year covered by such final order and calculate the
  amount of credit which is required by this subdivision to be  recaptured
  for each year based on such reduction.
    (d)  The  credit  allowed  under this subdivision for any taxable year
  shall not reduce the tax due for such  year  to  less  than  twenty-five
  dollars.
    44.  The  tax-free  NY  area  excise tax on telecommunication services
  credit. A taxpayer that is a business or owner of  a  business  that  is
  located in a tax-free NY area approved pursuant to article twenty-one of
  the  economic  development  law  shall  be allowed a credit equal to the
  excise tax on telecommunication services imposed by section one  hundred
  eighty-six-e  of this chapter and passed through to such business during
  the taxable year to the  extent  not  otherwise  deducted  in  computing
  entire  net  income  under  this  article.  However, except as otherwise
  provided for in this subdivision, if the amount of the credit  allowable
  under  this  subdivision  for  any  taxable  year reduces the tax to the
  amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision  one  of  section  two
  hundred  ten of this chapter or if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax based
  on the fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount of credit not  deductible
  in  such  taxable  year  shall be treated as an overpayment of tax to be
  credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions  of  section  one
  thousand  eighty-six  of  this  chapter. This credit may be claimed only
  where any tax imposed by such section one hundred eighty-six-e has  been
  separately  stated  on  a  bill  from  the provider of telecommunication
  services and paid  by  such  business  with  respect  to  such  services
  rendered  within  a tax-free NY area during the taxable year. Unless the
  taxpayer has a  tax-free  NY  area  allocation  factor  of  one  hundred
  percent,  the credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year
  shall not reduce the tax due for such  year  to  less  than  the  amount
  prescribed  in  paragraph  (d) of subdivision one of section two hundred
  ten of this chapter. Provided, however, the provisions of subsection (c)
  of section one thousand eighty-eight of this chapter notwithstanding, no
  interest shall be paid thereon.
    45. Order of credits.  Credits  allowable  under  this  article  which
  cannot  be  carried  over and which are not refundable shall be deducted
  first.  Credits allowable under this article which can be carried  over,
  and  carryovers  of such credits, shall be deducted next, and among such
  credits, those whose carryover is of limited duration shall be  deducted
  before those whose carryover is of unlimited duration. Credits allowable
  under this article which are refundable shall be deducted last.
    46.  Notwithstanding  the repeal of the credit provisions contained in
  section two hundred ten of this article or in article thirty-two of this
  chapter and the enactment of this section by a chapter of  the  laws  of
  two thousand fourteen:
    (a) A taxpayer shall be allowed to utilize any carryforward amounts of
  credits  to  which  the  taxpayer  was  entitled  as of the close of the
  taxable year beginning on or after January first, two thousand  fourteen
  and   before  January  first,  two  thousand  fifteen,  other  than  the
  carryforward amount of the minimum tax credit provided under subdivision
  thirteen of section two hundred ten, as that subdivision was  in  effect
  on December thirty-first, two thousand fourteen.
    (b)  A  taxpayer  shall  be required in a taxable year beginning on or
  after January first, two thousand fifteen, to recapture all or a portion
  of a credit allowed under a credit provision in section two hundred  ten
  or article thirty-two of this chapter for a taxable year beginning prior


 to  January  first,  two  thousand  fifteen if recapture would have been
  required under such credit provision.

  credit. A taxpayer who is eligible pursuant to section twenty-four-a  of
  this  chapter  shall  be  allowed a credit to be computed as provided in
  such section against the tax imposed by this article.
    (b) Application of credit. The credit allowed under  this  subdivision
  for  any taxable year shall not reduce the tax due for such year to less
  than the amount prescribed  in  paragraph  (d)  of  subdivision  one  of
  section  two hundred ten of this article. Provided, however, that if the
  amount of the credit allowable under this subdivision  for  any  taxable
  year  reduces  the  tax to such amount or if the taxpayer otherwise pays
  tax based on the fixed  dollar  minimum  amount,  the  excess  shall  be
  treated  as  an  overpayment  of  tax  to  be  credited  or  refunded in
  accordance with the provisions of section  one  thousand  eighty-six  of
  this  chapter.  Provided,  further,  the provisions of subsection (c) of
  section one thousand eighty-eight of this  chapter  notwithstanding,  no
  interest shall be paid thereon.

  defined  in paragraph one of subdivision (b) of section twenty-five-b of
  the labor law, shall be entitled to a credit against the tax imposed  by
  this  article. The amount of the credit shall be: fifteen percent of the
  qualified wages paid after January first,  two  thousand  fifteen  to  a
  qualified  full-time  employee  who  is  employed  for not less than six
  months and who works at least thirty hours per week; and  shall  be  ten
  percent  of  the  qualified wages paid after January first, two thousand
  fifteen to a qualified part-time employee who is employed for  not  less
  than  six  months  and  works  at least eight hours per week. The credit
  allowed pursuant to  this  subdivision  shall  not  exceed,  during  any
  taxable year, five thousand dollars for any qualified full time employee
  and  two  thousand  five  hundred  dollars  for  any qualified part time
  employee.  "Qualified  wages"  means  wages  paid  or  incurred  by  the
  qualified employer during the taxable year to a qualified employee which
  are attributable, with respect to such employee, to services rendered by
  the qualified employee.
    (b)  Carryover.  The  credit  allowed  under  this subdivision for any
  taxable year shall not reduce the tax due for such year to less than the
  amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision  one  of  section  two
  hundred  ten of this article. However, if the amount of credit allowable
  under this subdivision for any taxable year  reduces  the  tax  to  such
  amount  or  if the taxpayer otherwise pays tax based on the fixed dollar
  minimum amount, any amount of credit not deductible in such taxable year
  may be carried over to the following three years, and  may  be  deducted
  from the qualified employer's tax for such years.
    (c)  The taxpayer shall attach to its tax return its final certificate
  of eligibility issued by the commissioner of labor pursuant  to  section
  twenty-five-b  of the labor law for each taxable year that the credit is
  claimed. In no event shall the taxpayer be allowed a credit greater than
  the amount of the credit listed on the final certificate of eligibility.
  Notwithstanding any provision of  this  chapter  to  the  contrary,  the
  commissioner  and the commissioner's designees may release the names and
  addresses of any taxpayer claiming this credit and  the  amount  of  the
  credit earned by the taxpayer.

  tax credit if it claims any of  the  other  credits  for  employment  of
  persons  with  disabilities  under  either subsection (o) of section six

    (b) The credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year may
  not reduce the tax due for that year to less than the amount  prescribed

  article. However, if  the  amount  of  the  credit  allowed  under  this
  subdivision  for  any  taxable year reduces the tax to that amount or if
  the taxpayer otherwise pays  tax  based  on  the  fixed  dollar  minimum
  amount, any amount of credit not deductible in that taxable year will be
  treated  as  an  overpayment  of  tax  to  be  credited  or  refunded in

  this chapter. Provided, however, no interest will be paid thereon.

  fifty percent of a taxpayer's eligible training costs, up to a credit of
  ten  thousand dollars per employee completing eligible training pursuant
  to paragraph (a) of subdivision three of section four hundred  forty-one
  of the economic development law. The credit shall equal fifty percent of

  per intern completing eligible training pursuant  to  paragraph  (b)  of

  development law. In no event  shall  a  taxpayer  be  allowed  a  credit
  greater  than  the  amount  of  credit  listed on the certificate of tax
  credit issued by the commissioner of economic  development.  The  credit
  will  be  allowed  in the taxable year in which the eligible training is

  article. However, if the amount of credit allowed under this subdivision
  for any taxable year reduces the tax to such amount, or if the  taxpayer
  otherwise  pays tax based on the fixed dollar minimum amount, any amount
  of credit thus not deductible in that taxable year will be treated as an
  overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded  in  accordance  with  the
  provisions of section one thousand eighty-six of this chapter. Provided,
  however,  the  provisions  of  subsection  (c)  of  section one thousand

  credit,  or  in the case of a taxpayer who is a partner in a partnership

  percent  of  the fair market value of the taxpayer's qualified donations
  made to any eligible food pantry during the taxable year, not to  exceed

  thousand dollars.
    (b) Eligible farmer.  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision,  the  term
  "eligible  farmer"  means  a  taxpayer  whose  federal gross income from

  taxpayer must get and keep a  receipt  from  the  eligible  food  pantry
  showing:  (i)  the  name  of the eligible food pantry; (ii) the date and

  such  taxable  year  will  be  treated  as  an  overpayment of tax to be
  credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions  of  section  one
  thousand  eighty-six  of this chapter. Provided, however, the provisions

  two hundred  ten  of  this  article;  (ii)  the  combined  capital  base
  multiplied by the tax rate specified in paragraph (b) of subdivision one
  of  section  two  hundred  ten  of  this  article, but not exceeding the
  limitation provided for in that paragraph (b); or (iii) the fixed dollar
  minimum that is attributable to the designated  agent  of  the  combined
  group. In addition, the tax on a combined report shall include the fixed
  dollar  minimum  tax  specified  in  paragraph (d) of subdivision one of
  section two hundred ten of this article for each member of the  combined
  group, other than the designated agent, that is a taxpayer.
    (b)  The  combined  business income base is the amount of the combined
  business income of the combined group that is apportioned to the  state,
  reduced  by  any prior net operating loss conversion subtraction and any
  net operating loss  deduction  for  the  combined  group.  The  combined
  capital base is the amount of the combined capital of the combined group
  that is apportioned to the state.
    2.  Combined reports required. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c)
  of this subdivision, any taxpayer (i)  which  owns  or  controls  either
  directly  or  indirectly  more than fifty percent of the voting power of
  the capital stock of one or more other corporations, or (ii)  more  than
  fifty percent of the voting power of the capital stock of which is owned
  or  controlled  either  directly  or  indirectly  by  one  or more other
  corporations, or (iii) more than fifty percent of the  voting  power  of
  the  capital  stock  of which and the capital stock of one or more other
  corporations, is owned or controlled, directly  or  indirectly,  by  the
  same  interests,  and  (iv)  that  is engaged in a unitary business with
  those corporations (hereinafter referred to as "related  corporations"),
  shall make a combined report with those other corporations.
    (b)  A  corporation  required  to  make  a  combined report within the
  meaning of this section shall also include (i)  a  captive  REIT  and  a
  captive  RIC  if  the  captive REIT or captive RIC is not required to be
  included in  a  combined  report  under  article  thirty-three  of  this
  chapter; (ii) a combinable captive insurance company; and (iii) an alien
  corporation  that  satisfies  the  conditions  in  paragraph (a) of this
  subdivision if (I) under any provision of  the  internal  revenue  code,
  that  corporation  is  treated as a "domestic corporation" as defined in
  section seven thousand seven hundred one of the internal  revenue  code,
  or  (II)  it  has  effectively  connected  income  for  the taxable year
  pursuant to clause (iv) of the opening paragraph of subdivision nine  of
  section two hundred eight of this article.
    (c)  A  corporation  required  or  permitted to make a combined report
  under this section does not include (i) a corporation  that  is  taxable
  under a franchise tax imposed by article nine or article thirty-three of
  this  chapter  or  would  be  taxable  under  a franchise tax imposed by
  article nine or thirty-three of this chapter if subject to tax;  (ii)  a
  REIT  that  is  not a captive REIT, and a RIC that is not a captive RIC;

  corporation"  as  defined in section seven thousand seven hundred one of
  such code and has no effectively connected income for the  taxable  year
  pursuant  to clause (iv) of the opening paragraph of subdivision nine of
  section two hundred eight of this article. If a corporation  is  subject
  to  tax  under  this  article  solely  as a result of its ownership of a
  limited  partner  interest  in  a  limited  partnership  that  is  doing
  business,  employing capital, owning or leasing property, maintaining an
  office in this state, or deriving receipts from activity in this  state,


 and  none  of  the corporation's related corporations are subject to tax
  under this article, such corporation shall not be required or  permitted
  to  file  a  combined  report  under  this  section  with  such  related
  corporations.
    (d)  A  combined  report shall be filed by the designated agent of the
  combined group as determined under subdivision seven of this section.
    3. Commonly owned group election. (a) Subject  to  the  provisions  of
  paragraph  (c)  of subdivision two of this section, a taxpayer may elect
  to treat as its combined group all corporations that meet the  ownership
  requirements  described  in  paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision two of this
  section (such corporations collectively referred to in this  subdivision
  as  the  "commonly owned group"). If that election is made, the commonly
  owned group shall  calculate  the  combined  business  income,  combined
  capital,  and  fixed dollar minimum bases of all members of the group in
  accordance with subdivision four of this section, whether  or  not  that
  business income or business capital is from a single unitary business.
    (b)  The election under this subdivision shall be made on an original,
  timely filed return of the combined group,  determined  with  regard  to
  extensions of time for filing. Any corporation entering a commonly owned
  group  subsequent  to  the  year  of  election  shall be included in the
  combined group and is considered to have waived  any  objection  to  its
  inclusion in the combined group.
    (c)  The election shall be irrevocable, and binding for and applicable
  to the taxable year for which it is made and for the  next  six  taxable
  years.  The  election  will  automatically  be renewed for another seven
  taxable years after it has been in effect for seven taxable years unless
  it is  affirmatively  revoked.  The  revocation  shall  be  made  on  an
  original,  timely  filed  return  for  the  first taxable year after the
  completion of a seven year period  for  which  an  election  under  this
  subdivision  was  in  place. In the case of a revocation, a new election
  under this subdivision shall not be permitted in any of the  immediately
  following  three  taxable years. In determining the seven and three year
  periods described in this paragraph, short taxable years  shall  not  be
  considered or counted.
    4. Computation of tax bases on a combined report. (a) In computing the
  tax  bases  for a combined report, the combined group shall generally be
  treated as a single  corporation,  except  as  otherwise  provided,  and
  subject to any regulations or guidance issued by the commissioner or the
  department.
    (b)(i)  In  computing  combined  business  income,  all intercorporate
  dividends shall be eliminated, and all other intercorporate transactions
  shall be deferred in a manner similar  to  the  United  States  Treasury
  regulations  relating to intercompany transactions under section fifteen
  hundred two of the internal revenue code.
    (ii) In computing combined capital, all intercorporate  stockholdings,
  intercorporate  bills,  intercorporate  notes  receivable  and  payable,
  intercorporate accounts receivable and payable, and other intercorporate
  indebtedness, shall be eliminated.
    (c) Qualification for  credits,  including  any  limitations  thereon,
  shall  be  determined separately for each of the members of the combined
  group, and shall not be determined on a combined group basis, except  as
  otherwise  provided.  However,  the credits shall be applied against the
  combined tax of the group. To the extent that a provision of section two
  hundred ten-B of this article  limits  a  credit  to  the  fixed  dollar
  minimum amount prescribed in paragraph (d) of subdivision one of section
  two  hundred ten of this article, such fixed dollar minimum amount shall
  be  the  fixed  dollar  minimum  amount  that  is  attributable  to  the
  designated agent of the combined group.


   (d)  (i)  A  net  operating loss deduction is allowed in computing the
  combined business income base. Such deduction may reduce the tax on  the
  combined  business  income base to the higher of the tax on the combined
  capital base or the fixed dollar minimum amount that is attributable  to
  the  designated  agent  of  the combined group. A combined net operating
  loss deduction is equal to the amount of combined net operating loss  or
  losses  from  one  or  more  taxable  years  that are carried forward or
  carried back to a particular taxable year. A combined net operating loss
  is the combined business loss incurred  in  a  particular  taxable  year
  multiplied by the combined apportionment factor for that year determined
  as provided in subdivision five of this section.
    (ii)  The  combined  net  operating  loss  deduction  and combined net
  operating loss are also subject to the provisions contained  in  clauses
  one  through  seven of subparagraph (ix) of paragraph (a) of subdivision
  one of section two hundred ten of this article.
    (iii) In the case of a  corporation  that  files  a  combined  report,
  either  in the year the net operating loss is incurred or in the year in
  which a deduction is claimed on account of the loss,  the  combined  net
  operating  loss  deduction  is  determined as if the combined group is a
  single corporation  and,  to  the  extent  possible  and  not  otherwise
  inconsistent  with  this subdivision, is subject to the same limitations
  that would apply for federal income  tax  purposes  under  the  internal
  revenue  code and the code of federal regulations as if such corporation
  had filed for such taxable year a consolidated federal income tax return
  with the same  corporations  included  in  the  combined  report.  If  a
  corporation  files  a  combined report, regardless of whether it filed a
  separate return or consolidated return for federal income tax  purposes,
  the net operating loss and net operating loss deduction for the combined
  group  must  be  computed as if the corporation had filed a consolidated
  return for the same corporations for federal income tax purposes.
    (iv) In general, any net operating loss carryover from a year in which
  a combined report was filed shall be based on the combined net operating
  loss of the group of corporations filing such report. The portion of the
  combined loss attributable to any member  of  the  group  that  files  a
  separate  report for a succeeding taxable year will be an amount bearing
  the same relation to the combined loss as the net operating loss of such
  corporation bears to the total net operating loss of all members of  the
  group  having such losses to the extent that they are taken into account
  in computing the combined net operating loss.
    (d-1) A prior net operating loss conversion subtraction is allowed  in
  computing the combined business income base, as provided in subparagraph
  (viii) of paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section two hundred ten of
  this  article.  Such  subtraction  may  reduce  the  tax on the combined
  business income base to the higher of the tax on  the  combined  capital
  base  or  the  fixed  dollar  minimum amount that is attributable to the
  designated agent of the combined group.
    (e) (i) Any election made pursuant to  paragraph  (b)  of  subdivision
  six,  paragraphs (b) and (c) of subdivision six-a of section two hundred
  eight, and item (IV) of subclause two  of  clause  (B)  of  subparagraph
  (viii)  and  clause  seven  of  subparagraph  (ix)  of  paragraph (a) of
  subdivision one of section two hundred ten of this article  shall  apply
  to all members of the combined group.
    (ii)  The determination of whether or not the limitation on investment
  income provided in subparagraph (iii) of paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision
  six of section two hundred eight of this article applies to the combined
  group  shall  be  based  on the investment income of the combined group,
  determined  without  regard  to  interest   expenses   attributable   to


 investment  capital  or  investment income, and the entire net income of
  the combined group.
    (f)(i)  In  the  case  of a captive REIT or captive RIC required under
  this section to be included in a  combined  report,  entire  net  income
  shall  be  computed as required under subdivision five (in the case of a
  captive REIT) or subdivision seven (in the case of  a  captive  RIC)  of
  section  two  hundred nine of this article. However, the deduction under
  the internal revenue code for dividends paid  by  the  captive  REIT  or
  captive  RIC  to  any  member  of the affiliated group that includes the
  corporation that directly or indirectly owns over fifty percent  of  the
  voting  stock  of  the captive REIT or captive RIC shall not be allowed.
  For purposes of this subparagraph, the  term  "affiliated  group"  means
  "affiliated  group"  as  defined  in section fifteen hundred four of the
  internal revenue code, but without regard to the exceptions provided for
  in subsection (b) of that section.
    (ii) In the case of a combinable captive  insurance  company  required
  under  this  section  to  be  included  in a combined report, entire net
  income shall be computed as required by subdivision nine of section  two
  hundred eight of this article.
    (g) If more than one member of a combined group is eligible for any of
  the   modifications   described  in  paragraphs  (r),  (s)  and  (t)  of
  subdivision nine of section two hundred eight of this article, all  such
  members must utilize the same modification.
    5.  Apportionment  on  a  combined  report.  (a)  In  determining  the
  apportionment factor for a combined report, the  receipts,  net  income,
  net  gains and other items of all members of the combined group, whether
  or not they are a taxpayer, are included  and  intercorporate  receipts,
  income  and  gains  are  eliminated. Receipts, net income, net gains and
  other items are sourced, and the amounts allowed  in  the  apportionment
  factor  are determined, as provided in section two hundred ten-A of this
  article.
    (b) An election made to apportion income  and  gains  from  qualifying
  financial  instruments  pursuant to subparagraph one of paragraph (a) of
  subdivision five of section two hundred  ten-A  of  this  article  shall
  apply to all members of the combined group.
    6.  Liability  of combined group members. Every member of the combined
  group that is subject to tax under this article  shall  be  jointly  and
  severally liable for the tax due pursuant to a combined report.
    7.  Designated  agent.  Each  combined group shall have one designated
  agent for the combined group,  which  shall  be  a  taxpayer.  Only  the
  designated  agent may act on behalf of the members of the combined group
  for matters relating to the combined report.

  of  the  fourth  month  after  the close of its fiscal year, for taxable
  years beginning on or after January first,  two  thousand  sixteen,  and
  except,  also,  that  a  corporation  which is a DISC shall transmit its
  report on or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month  following  the
  close of its calendar or fiscal year), setting forth such information as
  the  commissioner  may  prescribe  and  every  taxpayer  which ceases to
  exercise its franchise or to be subject  to  the  tax  imposed  by  this
  article  shall transmit to the commissioner a report on the date of such
  cessation or at such other time as the commissioner may require covering
  each year or period for which no report was theretofore  filed.  In  the
  case of a termination year of an S corporation, the S short year and the
  C short year shall be treated as separate short taxable years, provided,
  however,  the  due  date of the report for the S short year shall be the
  same as the due date of the report for the C short year. Every  taxpayer
  shall also transmit such other reports and such facts and information as
  the  commissioner may require in the administration of this article. The
  commissioner may grant a reasonable extension of time for filing reports
  whenever good cause exists.
    An automatic extension of six months for  the  filing  of  its  annual
  report  shall  be allowed any taxpayer if, within the time prescribed by
  the preceding paragraph, such taxpayer files with  the  commissioner  an
  application for extension in such form as the commissioner may prescribe
  by  regulation  and pays on or before the date of such filing the amount
  properly estimated as its tax.
    2. Every report shall have annexed  thereto  a  certification  by  the
  president,   vice-president,   treasurer,   assistant  treasurer,  chief
  accounting officer or any other officer of the taxpayer duly  authorized
  so  to act to the effect that the statements contained therein are true.
  In the case of an association, within the meaning of paragraph three  of
  section (a) of section seventy-seven hundred one of the internal revenue
  code,  a  publicly  traded  partnership  treated  as  a  corporation for
  purposes of the internal revenue code pursuant to section  seventy-seven
  hundred four thereof and any business conducted by a trustee or trustees
  wherein  interest  or  ownership  is  evidenced by certificates or other
  written instruments such certification shall be made by any person  duly
  authorized  so  to  act  on  behalf of such association, publicly traded
  partnership or business. The fact that an individual's name is signed on
  a certification of the report shall be prima facie  evidence  that  such
  individual is authorized to sign and certify the report on behalf of the
  corporation.   Blank   forms  of  reports  shall  be  furnished  by  the
  commissioner of taxation and finance, on  application,  but  failure  to
  secure  such  a  blank  shall  not  release  any  corporation  from  the
  obligation of making any report required by this article.
    2-a. The  commissioner  may  prescribe  regulations  and  instructions
  requiring  returns  of  information  to be made and filed in conjunction
  with the reports required to be filed pursuant to this article, relating
  to  payments  made  to  shareholders  owning,  directly  or  indirectly,
  individually  or in the aggregate, more than fifty percent of the issued
  capital stock of the  taxpayer,  where  such  payments  are  treated  as


 payments of interest in the computation of entire net income reported on
  such reports.
    3.  If  the  amount  of  taxable  income  for any year of any taxpayer
  (including any taxpayer which has elected to be taxed under subchapter s
  of chapter one of the internal revenue code), as returned to the  United
  States  treasury  department is changed or corrected by the commissioner
  of internal revenue or other officer  of  the  United  States  or  other
  competent   authority,  or  where  a  renegotiation  of  a  contract  or
  subcontract with the United  States  results  in  a  change  in  taxable
  income,  such  taxpayer  shall  report such changed or corrected taxable
  income, or the results of such renegotiation, within ninety days (or one
  hundred twenty days, in the case of a taxpayer making a combined  report
  under  this article for such year) after the final determination of such
  change  or  correction  or  renegotiation,  or  as   required   by   the
  commissioner,  and  shall  concede the accuracy of such determination or
  state wherein it is erroneous. The allowance of  a  tentative  carryback
  adjustment based upon a net operating loss carryback or net capital loss
  carryback  pursuant to section sixty-four hundred eleven of the internal
  revenue code, as amended, shall be treated as a final determination  for
  purposes of this subdivision. Any taxpayer filing an amended return with
  such  department  shall  also  file  within  ninety days (or one hundred
  twenty days, in the case of a taxpayer making a  combined  report  under
  this  article  for  such  year)  thereafter  an  amended report with the
  commissioner.
    4. For provisions  relating  to  combined  reports,  see  section  two
  hundred ten-C of this article.
    5.  In  case  it  shall appear to the commissioner that any agreement,
  understanding or arrangement exists between the taxpayer and  any  other
  corporation  or  any  person  or  firm,  whereby the activity, business,
  income or capital of the taxpayer within  the  state  is  improperly  or
  inaccurately reflected, the commissioner is authorized and empowered, in
  the commissioner's discretion and in such manner as the commissioner may
  determine,  to  adjust  items  of income, deductions and capital, and to
  eliminate assets in computing any apportionment percentage provided only
  that any income directly traceable thereto be also excluded from  entire
  net income, so as equitably to determine the tax. Where (a) any taxpayer
  conducts  its  activity  or business under any agreement, arrangement or
  understanding in such manner as either directly or indirectly to benefit
  its members or stockholders, or any of them, or any  person  or  persons
  directly  or  indirectly  interested  in  such  activity or business, by
  entering into any transaction at more or less than a fair  price  which,
  but  for  such  agreement, arrangement or understanding, might have been
  paid or received therefor, or (b) any taxpayer, a substantial portion of
  whose capital stock is owned either directly or  indirectly  by  another
  corporation,  enters into any transaction with such other corporation on
  such terms as to create an improper loss or net income, the commissioner
  may include in the entire net income of the taxpayer  the  fair  profits
  which,  but  for  such  agreement,  arrangement  or  understanding,  the
  taxpayer might have derived from such transaction.  Where  any  taxpayer
  owns,  directly  or  indirectly,  more than fifty percent of the capital
  stock of another  corporation  subject  to  tax  under  section  fifteen
  hundred  two-a  of this chapter and fifty percent or less of whose gross
  receipts for the taxable year consist of premiums, the commissioner  may
  include  in  the  entire  net  income  of  the  taxpayer,  as  a  deemed
  distribution, the amount of the net income of the other corporation that
  is in excess of its net premium income.


   6. An action may be brought at any time by the attorney-general at the
  instance of the tax commission, in the name of the state, to compel  the
  filing of reports due under this article.
    7. Reports shall be preserved for five years, and thereafter until the
  tax commission orders them to be destroyed.
    8. (a) Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise
  provided  by  law,  it  shall  be unlawful for any tax commissioner, any
  officer or employee of the department, or any person  who,  pursuant  to
  this  section,  is  permitted  to  inspect  any  report,  or to whom any
  information contained in any report is furnished, or any person  engaged
  or  retained by such department on an independent contract basis, or any
  person who in any manner may acquire knowledge  of  the  contents  of  a
  report  filed  pursuant to this article, to divulge or make known in any
  manner the amount of income or any particulars set forth or disclosed in
  any report under this article. The officers charged with the custody  of
  such reports shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of
  anything  contained  in  them  in any action or proceeding in any court,
  except on behalf of the state  or  the  commissioner  in  an  action  or
  proceeding  under  the provisions of this chapter or in any other action
  or proceeding involving the collection of a tax due under  this  chapter
  to  which  the state or the commissioner is a party or a claimant, or on
  behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions  of
  this  article  when  the  reports  or  facts  shown thereby are directly
  involved in such action or proceeding, in any of which events the  court
  may  require  the  production  of, and may admit in evidence, so much of
  said reports or of the facts shown  thereby  as  are  pertinent  to  the
  action  or  proceeding, and no more. The commissioner may, nevertheless,
  publish a copy or a summary of any determination  or  decision  rendered
  after   the   formal  hearing  provided  for  in  section  one  thousand
  eighty-nine of this  chapter.  Nothing  herein  shall  be  construed  to
  prohibit   the   delivery  to  a  corporation  or  its  duly  authorized
  representative of a copy of any report filed by it, nor to prohibit  the
  publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification
  of  particular  reports  and  the  items  thereof; or the publication of
  delinquent lists showing the names of taxpayers who have failed  to  pay
  their  taxes  at  the  time  and  in  the manner provided by section two
  hundred thirteen of this chapter together with any relevant  information
  which in the opinion of the commissioner may assist in the collection of
  such  delinquent  taxes;  or  the  inspection by the attorney general or
  other  legal  representatives  of  the  state  of  the  report  of   any
  corporation  which  shall  bring  action  to set aside or review the tax
  based thereon, or against which  an  action  or  proceeding  under  this
  chapter has been recommended by the commissioner of taxation and finance
  or the attorney general or has been instituted; or the inspection of the
  reports of any corporation by the comptroller or duly designated officer
  or  employee  of the state department of audit and control, for purposes
  of the audit of a refund of any tax paid by such corporation under  this
  article.
    (b)  (i)  Any  officer or employee of the state who willfully violates
  the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall  be  dismissed
  from  office and be incapable of holding any public office in this state
  for a period of five years thereafter.
    (ii) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see article thirty-seven
  of this chapter.
    (c) Notwithstanding  any  provisions  of  this  subdivision,  the  tax
  commission may permit the secretary of the treasury of the United States
  or  his delegates, or the proper officer of any other state charged with
  tax administration, or the  authorized  representative  of  either  such


 officer, to inspect the reports filed under this article, or may furnish
  to such officer or his authorized representative an abstract of any such
  report  or  supply  information concerning an item contained in any such
  report,  or  disclosed  by  an investigation of tax liability under this
  article, but such  permission  shall  be  granted  or  such  information
  furnished  to such officer or his representative only if the laws of the
  United States or of  such  other  state,  as  the  case  may  be,  grant
  substantially  similar  privileges  to the commission or officer of this
  state charged with the administration of the tax imposed by this article
  and such information is to be used for tax purposes only;  and  provided
  further  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and finance may furnish to the
  secretary of the treasury of the United States  or  his  delegates  such
  reports  filed  under  this article and other tax information, as he may
  consider proper, for use in  court  actions  or  proceedings  under  the
  internal  revenue  code,  whether  civil  or  criminal,  where a written
  request therefor has been made  to  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance  by  the secretary of the treasury or his delegates provided the
  laws of the United States grant  substantially  similar  powers  to  the
  secretary  of  the  treasury or his delegates. Where the commissioner of
  taxation and finance has so authorized  use  of  reports  or  other  tax
  information  in  such  actions or proceedings, officers and employees of
  the department of taxation and finance may testify in  such  actions  or
  proceedings  in  respect  to  such reports or other tax information; and
  provided further that such commission may furnish any municipality  with
  such information contained in the reports filed under this article as it
  may   consider   proper  for  use  in  any  certiorari  or  condemnation
  proceeding.
    9.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  eight  of  this
  section,  the  tax  commission  may  permit the officer charged with the
  administration of an income tax imposed by any city of the state of  New
  York,  or  the authorized representative of such officer, to inspect the
  reports filed under this article, or may furnish to such officer or  his
  authorized  representative  an  abstract  of  any  such report or supply
  information  concerning  an  item  contained  in  any  such  report,  or
  disclosed  by any investigation of tax liability under this article, but
  such permission shall be granted or such information furnished  to  such
  officer  or his representative only if the local laws of such city grant
  substantially similar privileges to the commission or  officer  of  this
  state charged with the administration of the tax imposed by this article
  and  such  information is to be used for tax purposes only; and provided
  further the commissioner of taxation and finance  may  furnish  to  such
  city  officer or his delegates and the legal representative of such city
  such reports filed under this article and other tax information,  as  he
  may  consider proper, for use in court actions or proceedings under such
  local law, whether civil or criminal, where a written  request  therefor
  has  been  made to the commissioner of taxation and finance by such city
  officer or his delegates or by such legal representative of  such  city,
  provided  the local law of such city grants substantially similar powers
  to the city officer charged with the administration of the  city  income
  tax or his delegates. Where the commissioner of taxation and finance has
  so authorized use of reports or other tax information in such actions or
  proceedings,  officers  and  employees of the department of taxation and
  finance may testify in such actions or proceedings in  respect  to  such
  reports or other tax information.
    10.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  eight  of this
  section, the tax commission, in its discretion, may  require  or  permit
  any  or  all persons liable for any tax imposed by this article, to make
  payments on account of estimated tax and payment of any tax, penalty  or


 interest  imposed  by  this  article  to  banks, banking houses or trust
  companies designated by the tax commission and to file  declarations  of
  estimated  tax,  applications  for  automatic extensions of time to file
  reports,  and reports with such banks, banking houses or trust companies
  as agents of the tax commission, in lieu  of  making  any  such  payment
  directly  to  the  tax  commission.  However,  the  tax commission shall
  designate only such banks, banking houses or trust companies as  are  or
  shall  be  designated  by  the  comptroller  as depositories pursuant to
  section two hundred eighteen.
    11. Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  eight  of  this
  section,  the commissioner may disclose to the head of any state agency,
  pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-f of this chapter, the  name
  and  taxpayer identification number of any taxpayer whose overpayment is
  certified to the comptroller to be credited against a  past-due  legally
  enforceable  debt  owed to such agency and the amount of the overpayment
  and interest thereon certified to the comptroller to be credited against
  a past-due legally enforceable debt, and the commissioner  may  disclose
  to  the  commissioner  of  finance  of the city of New York, pursuant to
  section one hundred seventy-one-l of this chapter, the name and taxpayer
  identification number of any taxpayer whose overpayment is certified  to
  the  comptroller  to  be credited against a city of New York tax warrant
  judgment debt and the amount of the  overpayment  and  interest  thereon
  certified  to  the comptroller to be credited against a city of New York
  tax warrant judgment debt.
    12. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision  eight  of  this
  section,  the  commissioner  and  the  comptroller  shall  enter into an
  agreement pursuant  to  which  the  commissioner  shall,  upon  request,
  provide  the  comptroller  with  a  report,  not  more  frequently  than
  annually, with respect to corporations  or  other  entities  which  have
  filed a business corporation franchise tax report under this article for
  any  taxable  year  within ten calendar years prior to the report to the
  comptroller made pursuant to this subdivision, providing  the  following
  information,  to  the  extent that such information is readily available
  from the department's system for identifying taxpayer indicative data:
    (1) business name and legal name, if different;
    (2) business address and mailing address;
    (3) federal employer identification number;
    (4) date entered into business.
    (b) Each report to the comptroller made pursuant to  this  subdivision
  shall  list  each corporation or other entity with respect to which such
  report is made according to the total assets reported for the end of the
  year on its most recent available  business  corporation  franchise  tax
  report,  in  descending order. Such reports to the comptroller shall not
  disclose the actual amount of total assets  reported  on  such  business
  corporation franchise tax reports.
    (c)  The  information  provided  to  the  comptroller pursuant to this
  subdivision shall be used only for administration and enforcement of the
  abandoned property law. The comptroller may redisclose  the  information
  provided  under  this  subdivision  only  to  the  extent  necessary for
  enforcement or administration of the abandoned property law.
    (d) The reports to the comptroller  required  under  this  subdivision
  shall  be submitted by electronic means or in some other format which is
  mutually acceptable to the comptroller and the commissioner. The written
  agreement with the  comptroller  shall  set  forth  the  procedures  for
  providing  the  information  the  commissioner  is  allowed  to disclose
  pursuant to this subdivision.
    (e) Notwithstanding article six of the  public  officers  law  or  any
  other  provision  of law, the reports to be furnished to the comptroller


 pursuant to this subdivision  shall  not  be  open  to  the  public  for
  inspection.
    14.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  eight  of this
  section, the commissioner may disclose to a  taxpayer  or  a  taxpayer's
  related  member,  as  defined  in  paragraph  (o) of subdivision nine of
  section two hundred eight of this article, information relating  to  any
  royalty  payments paid, incurred or received by such taxpayer or related
  member to or from the other, including the treatment of such payments by
  the taxpayer or the related member in any report or  return  transmitted
  to the commissioner under this chapter.
    15.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  subdivision  eight  of this
  section,  the  commissioner  shall  provide  the  statements  and  other
  required information requested on tax reports under section four hundred
  eight  of  the  business  corporation  law to the secretary of state for
  filing. Such provision may also include a copy or image of that  portion
  of  the  report  solely  pertinent  to  such  information  to the extent
  feasible.   The   commissioner   any   also   provide   information   on
  noncompliance.
    16.  (a)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of subdivision eight of this
  section, upon written request from the chairperson of the  committee  on
  ways  and  means  of  the  United  States  House of Representatives, the
  chairperson of the committee on finance of the United States Senate,  or
  the  chairperson of the joint committee on taxation of the United States
  Congress, the commissioner shall furnish such committee with any current
  or prior year reports specified in such request that  were  filed  under
  this  article  by  the president of the United States, vice-president of
  the United States, member of the United States Congress representing New
  York state, or any person who served in or was employed by the executive
  branch of the government of the United States on the executive staff  of
  the president, in the executive office of the president, or in an acting
  or  confirmed  capacity  in  a  position  subject to confirmation by the
  United States senate;  or,  in  New  York  state:  a  statewide  elected
  official,  as  defined  in  paragraph  (a) of subdivision one of section
  seventy-three-a of the public officers law; a state officer or employee,
  as defined in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (c) of  subdivision  one  of
  such  section seventy-three-a; a political party chairperson, as defined
  in paragraph (h) of subdivision one of such section  seventy-three-a;  a
  local  elected  official,  as  defined  in  subdivisions  one and two of
  section eight hundred  ten  of  the  general  municipal  law;  a  person
  appointed,  pursuant to law, to serve due to vacancy or otherwise in the
  position of a local elected official, as defined in subdivisions one and
  two of section eight hundred ten of the general municipal law; a  member
  of  the  state  legislature;  or a judge or justice of the unified court
  system, or filed  by  a  partnership,  firm,  association,  corporation,
  joint-stock  company,  trust  or  similar  entity directly or indirectly
  controlled by any  individual  listed  in  this  paragraph,  whether  by
  contract,  through  ownership  or control of a majority interest in such
  entity, or otherwise, or filed  by  a  partnership,  firm,  association,
  corporation,  joint-stock  company, trust or similar entity of which any
  individual listed in this paragraph holds ten percent  or  more  of  the
  voting  securities  of  such  entity;  provided  however  that, prior to
  furnishing any report, the commissioner  shall  redact  any  copy  of  a
  federal return (or portion thereof) attached to, or any information on a
  federal  return  that  is  reflected  on,  such  report,  and any social
  security numbers, account numbers and residential address information.
    (b) No reports shall be furnished pursuant to this subdivision  unless
  the  chairperson  of  the requesting committee certifies in writing that
  such reports have been requested related to, and in  furtherance  of,  a


 legitimate  task of the Congress, that the requesting committee has made
  a written request to the United States secretary  of  the  treasury  for
  related  federal  reports  or  report information, pursuant to 26 U.S.C.
  Section  6103(f),  and  that  if such requested reports are inspected by
  and/or submitted to another committee, to the  United  States  House  of
  Representatives,  or  to  the United States Senate, then such inspection
  and/or submission shall occur in a manner consistent with federal law as
  informed by the requirements and procedures  established  in  26  U.S.C.
  Section 6103(f).




   §  213.  Payment  and lien of tax. 1. To the extent the tax imposed by
  section two hundred nine of this chapter shall not have been  previously
  paid pursuant to section two hundred thirteen-b of this chapter,
    a.  such  tax,  or  the  balance  thereof,  shall  be  payable  to the
  commissioner in full at the time the report is required to be filed, and
    b. such tax, or the balance thereof, imposed  on  any  taxpayer  which
  ceases  to exercise its franchise or to be subject to the tax imposed by
  this article shall be payable to the commissioner at the time the report
  is required to be filed, provided such tax  of  a  domestic  corporation
  which  continues to possess its franchise shall be subject to adjustment
  as the circumstances may require; all other taxes of any such  taxpayer,
  which  pursuant  to  the  foregoing  provisions  of  this  section would
  otherwise be payable subsequent to the time such report is  required  to
  be filed, shall nevertheless be payable at such time.
    2.  If any taxpayer, within the time prescribed by section two hundred
  eleven of this article, shall have applied for an automatic extension of
  time to file its annual report and shall have paid to  the  commissioner
  of  taxation and finance on or before the date such application is filed
  an amount properly estimated as  provided  by  said  section,  the  only
  amount  payable  in  addition  to  the  tax  shall  be  interest  at the
  underpayment rate set  by  the  commissioner  pursuant  to  section  one
  thousand  ninety-six of this chapter, or, if no rate is set, at the rate
  of six per centum per annum upon the amount by which  the  tax,  or  the
  portion thereof payable on or before the date the report was required to
  be  filed,  exceeds  the  amount  so paid. For purposes of the preceding
  sentence:
    a. an amount so paid shall be  deemed  properly  estimated  if  it  is
  either  (i)  not  less  than  ninety  per  centum  of the tax as finally
  determined, or (ii) not less than the tax shown on the taxpayer's report
  for the preceding taxable year, if such preceding  year  was  a  taxable
  year of twelve months; and
    b.  the time when a report is required to be filed shall be determined
  without regard to any extension of time for filing such report.
    3. The commissioner may grant  a  reasonable  extension  of  time  for
  payment  of  any tax imposed by this article under such conditions as he
  or she deems just and proper.






	   §   213-a.   Declaration   of   estimated   tax.--(a)  Requirement  of
  declaration.--Every taxpayer subject to the tax imposed by  section  two
  hundred  nine  of this chapter shall make a declaration of its estimated
  tax for the current privilege period, containing such information as the
  commissioner of taxation and finance may  prescribe  by  regulations  or
  instructions, if such estimated tax can reasonably be expected to exceed
  one  thousand  dollars.  If  a  taxpayer is subject to the tax surcharge
  imposed under section two  hundred  nine-B  of  this  article  and  such
  taxpayer's  estimated tax under section two hundred nine of this article
  can reasonably be expected to exceed one thousand dollars, such taxpayer
  shall also make a declaration of its estimated  tax  surcharge  for  the
  current privilege period.
    (b)  Definition  of  estimated  tax  and estimated tax surcharge.--The
  terms "estimated tax" and "estimated tax  surcharge"  mean  the  amounts
  which  a  taxpayer  estimates  to be the tax or tax surcharge imposed by
  section two hundred nine or two hundred nine-B,  respectively,  of  this
  chapter  for  the  current  privilege  period,  less the amount which it
  estimates to be the sum of any credits allowable against the tax or  tax
  surcharge, respectively.
    (c) Time for filing declaration.--A declaration of estimated tax and a
  declaration  of estimated tax surcharge shall be filed on or before June
  fifteenth of the current privilege period in  the  case  of  a  taxpayer
  which  reports  on  the  basis  of  a  calendar year, except that if the
  requirements of subdivision (a) are first met:
    (1) after May thirty-first and before September first of such  current
  privilege  period, the declaration shall be filed on or before September
  fifteenth, or
    (2) after August  thirty-first  and  before  December  first  of  such
  current  privilege  period,  the declaration shall be filed on or before
  December fifteenth.
    (d) Amendments of declaration.--A taxpayer  may  amend  a  declaration
  under regulations of the tax commission.
    (e) Report as declaration.--If, on or before February fifteenth of the
  succeeding  year in the case of a taxpayer which reports on the basis of
  a calendar year, a taxpayer files its report for the year for which  the
  declaration  is required, and pays therewith the balance, if any, of the
  full amount of the tax or tax surcharge shown to be due on the report,
    (i)  such  report  shall  be  considered  as  its  declaration  if  no
  declaration  was required to be filed during the calendar or fiscal year
  for which the tax  or  tax  surcharge  was  imposed,  but  is  otherwise
  required  to  be  filed  on  or  before  December  fifteenth pursuant to
  subdivision (c),
    (ii) such report shall be considered as  the  amendment  permitted  by
  subdivision  (d)  to be filed on or before December fifteenth if the tax

  or  estimated  tax surcharge, as the case may be, shown on a declaration
  previously made.
    (f) Fiscal year.--This section shall apply  to  privilege  periods  of
  twelve  months  other  than  a  calendar year by the substitution of the

  months  ending  at  any  time  during the calendar year nineteen hundred
  seventy and thereafter, every taxpayer subject to  the  tax  imposed  by
  section  two  hundred  nine  of  this  chapter  must pay with the report
  required to be filed for the preceding  privilege  period,  or  with  an
  application for extension of the time for filing the report, for taxable
  years beginning before January first, two thousand sixteen, and must pay
  on  or  before  the  fifteenth  day of the third month of such privilege
  periods, for taxable years beginning on  or  after  January  first,  two
  thousand  sixteen,  an  amount  equal  to (i) twenty-five percent of the
  second preceding year's tax if the second preceding year's tax  exceeded
  one  thousand dollars but was equal to or less than one hundred thousand
  dollars, or (ii) forty percent of the second preceding year's tax if the
  second preceding year's tax exceeded one hundred  thousand  dollars.  If
  the  second  preceding year's tax under section two hundred nine of this
  chapter exceeded one thousand dollars and the taxpayer is subject to the
  tax surcharge imposed by section two hundred nine-B of this chapter, the
  taxpayer must also pay with the tax  surcharge  report  required  to  be
  filed  for the second preceding privilege period, or with an application
  for extension of the time for  filing  the  report,  for  taxable  years
  beginning before January first, two thousand sixteen, and must pay on or

  for taxable years beginning on or  after  January  first,  two  thousand
  sixteen, an amount equal to (i) twenty-five percent of the tax surcharge

  privilege period, or with an application for extension of the  time  for
  filing  the  report,  an  amount equal to (i) twenty-five percent of the
  preceding year's tax if the preceding year's tax exceeded  one  thousand
  dollars  but  was equal to or less than one hundred thousand dollars, or
  (ii) forty percent of the preceding year's tax if the  preceding  year's
  tax exceeded one hundred thousand dollars.
    (b)  Other installments.--In privilege periods of twelve months ending

  to which a declaration for such privilege period is  required  shall  be
  paid, in the case of a taxpayer which reports on the basis of a calendar
  year, as follows:
    (1)  If  the  declaration  is  filed  on or before June fifteenth, the
  estimated tax or estimated tax surcharge shown thereon,  after  applying
  thereto  the  amount,  if  any,  paid  during  the same privilege period
  pursuant to subdivision (a), shall be paid in three equal  installments.
  One  of such installments shall be paid at the time of the filing of the
  declaration, one shall be paid on the following September fifteenth, and
  one on the following December fifteenth.
    (2) If the declaration is filed after June  fifteenth  and  not  after
  September  fifteenth of such privilege period, and is not required to be
  filed on or before June fifteenth of such period, the estimated  tax  or
  estimated  tax  surcharge  shown  on  such  declaration,  after applying
  thereto the amount, if  any,  paid  during  the  same  privilege  period
  pursuant  to  subdivision  (a), shall be paid in two equal installments.
  One of such installments shall be paid at the time of the filing of  the
  declaration and one shall be paid on the following December fifteenth.


   (3)  If  the  declaration  is  filed after September fifteenth of such
  privilege period, and is not required to be filed on or before September
  fifteenth of such privilege period, the estimated tax or  estimated  tax
  surcharge  shown on such declaration, after applying thereto the amount,
  if any, paid in respect of such privilege period pursuant to subdivision
  (a), shall be paid in full at the time of the filing of the declaration.
    (4) If the declaration is filed after the time prescribed therefor, or
  after  the  expiration of any extension of time therefor, paragraphs (2)
  and (3) of this subdivision shall not apply, and there shall be paid  at
  the  time  of such filing all installments of estimated tax or estimated
  tax surcharge  payable  at  or  before  such  time,  and  the  remaining
  installments  shall be paid at the times at which, and in the amounts in
  which, they would have been payable if the declaration  had  been  filed
  when due.
    (c)  Amendments  of declaration.--If any amendment of a declaration is
  filed, the remaining installments, if any, shall be ratably increased or
  decreased (as the case may be) to reflect any increase  or  decrease  in
  the  estimated  tax  or  estimated  tax  surcharge  by  reason  of  such
  amendment, and if any amendment is made after September fifteenth of the
  privilege period, any increase in the estimated  tax  or  estimated  tax
  surcharge  by  reason  thereof  shall be paid at the time of making such
  amendment.
    (d) Application of installments based on the second  preceding  year's
  tax.--(1)  Any  amount paid pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be applied
  after payment as a  first  installment  against  the  estimated  tax  or
  estimated  tax  surcharge, respectively, of the taxpayer for the current
  privilege period shown on the declaration required to be filed  pursuant
  to  section two hundred thirteen-a of this chapter or, if no declaration
  of estimated tax or a declaration of estimated tax surcharge is required
  to be filed by the taxpayer pursuant to such section,  any  such  amount
  shall  be  considered  a  payment on account of the tax or tax surcharge
  shown on the report required to  be  filed  by  the  taxpayer  for  such
  privilege period.
    (2)  Any  amount  paid pursuant to paragraph four of subsection (c) of
  section six hundred fifty-eight of this chapter on behalf of a  taxpayer
  subject to tax under this article shall be applied against the estimated
  tax  of  the  taxpayer  for  the  taxable  year shown on the declaration
  required to be filed pursuant to section two hundred thirteen-a of  this
  article,  or  if  no  declaration is filed pursuant to such section, any
  such amount shall be considered a payment on account of the tax  on  the
  return required to be filed by the taxpayer for such taxable year.
    (e)  Interest  on  certain  installments based on the second preceding
  year's tax.--Notwithstanding the  provisions  of  section  one  thousand
  eighty-eight  of this chapter or of section sixteen of the state finance
  law, if an amount paid pursuant to subdivision (a) exceeds  the  tax  or
  tax surcharge, respectively, shown on the report required to be filed by
  the  taxpayer for the privilege period during which the amount was paid,
  interest shall be allowed and paid on the amount by which the amount  so
  paid  pursuant to such subdivision exceeds such tax or tax surcharge. In
  the case of amounts so paid pursuant to subdivision (a),  such  interest
  shall   be  allowed  and  paid  at  the  overpayment  rate  set  by  the
  commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to  section  one  thousand
  ninety-six of this chapter, or if no rate is set, at the rate of six per
  centum per annum from the date of payment of the amount so paid pursuant
  to  such  subdivision to the fifteenth day of the fourth month following
  the close of the taxable year, provided, however, that no interest shall
  be allowed or paid under this subdivision if the amount thereof is  less


 than  one dollar or if such interest becomes payable solely because of a
  carryback of a net operating loss in a subsequent privilege period.
    (f)  The  preceding  year's  tax  and  the second preceding year's tax
  defined.-- As used in this section, "the preceding year's tax" means the

  been filed for extension of the time for filing the report  required  to
  be filed for such preceding calendar or fiscal year, the amount properly
  estimated  pursuant  to  section two hundred thirteen of this article as
  the tax imposed upon the taxpayer for such calendar or fiscal  year.  As
  used  in  this  section, "the second preceding year's tax" means the tax

  may require, including the furnishing of a bond or other security by the
  taxpayer in an amount not exceeding  twice  the  amount  for  which  any
  extension of time for payment is granted, provided however that interest
  at the underpayment rate set by the commissioner pursuant to section one
  thousand  ninety-six  of this chapter, or if no rate is set, at the rate
  of six per centum per annum for the period of  the  extension  shall  be
  charged  and collected on the amount for which any extension of time for
  payment is granted under this subdivision.

   § 216.  Collection of taxes.   Every foreign corporation (other than a
  moneyed corporation) subject to the provisions of this article, except a
  corporation  having a certificate of authority under section two hundred
  twelve of the general corporation law or having authority to do business
  by virtue of section thirteen hundred five of the  business  corporation
  law,  shall file in the department of state a certificate of designation
  in its corporate name, signed and acknowledged by  its  president  or  a
  vice-president  or its secretary or treasurer, under its corporate seal,
  designating the secretary of state as its agent upon whom process in any
  action provided for by this article may be served within this state, and
  setting forth an address to which the secretary of state  shall  mail  a
  copy  of  any  such  process against the corporation which may be served
  upon him.  In case any such corporation shall have failed to  file  such
  certificate  of  designation,  it shall be deemed to have designated the
  secretary of state as its agent upon whom such process against it may be
  served; and until a certificate of designation shall have been filed the
  corporation shall be deemed to have directed the secretary of  state  to
  mail  copies  of  process served upon him to the corporation at its last
  known office address within or without the state.  When a certificate of
  designation has been filed by such corporation the  secretary  of  state
  shall  mail  copies of process thereafter served upon him to the address
  set forth in such certificate.  Any such corporation, from time to time,
  may change the address to which the secretary of state  is  directed  to
  mail copies of process, by filing a certificate to that effect executed,
  signed  and  acknowledged in like manner as a certificate of designation
  as herein provided.  Service of process upon  any  such  corporation  or
  upon any corporation having a certificate of authority under section two
  hundred  twelve of the general corporation law or having authority to do
  business by virtue of section thirteen  hundred  five  of  the  business
  corporation  law,  in  any  action commenced at any time pursuant to the
  provisions of this  article,  may  be  made  by  either  (1)  personally
  delivering  to  and  leaving  with  the  secretary  of  state,  a deputy
  secretary of state or with any person authorized  by  the  secretary  of
  state  to receive such service duplicate copies thereof at the office of
  the department of state in the  city  of  Albany,  in  which  event  the
  secretary  of  state  shall  forthwith  send  by registered mail, return
  receipt requested, one of such copies to the corporation at the  address
  designated  by  it or at its last known office address within or without
  the state,  or  (2)  personally  delivering  to  and  leaving  with  the
  secretary  of  state,  a  deputy  secretary  of state or with any person
  authorized by the secretary of state to receive  such  service,  a  copy
  thereof  at  the office of the department of state in the city of Albany
  and by delivering a copy thereof to, and leaving  such  copy  with,  the
  president,  vice-president,  secretary,  assistant secretary, treasurer,
  assistant treasurer, or cashier of  such  corporation,  or  the  officer
  performing  corresponding functions under another name, or a director or
  managing agent of such corporation, personally without the state.  Proof
  of such personal service without the state shall be filed with the clerk
  of the court in which the action is pending  within  thirty  days  after
  such  service,  and  such service shall be complete ten days after proof
  thereof is filed.




   §  217.  Penalties.  1.  If any taxes, penalties or interest due under
  this article are not paid, or any report required is not filed, and  the
  tax  commission  is  satisfied  that the failure to make such payment or
  file  such  report  is  intentional,   it   may   so   report   to   the
  attorney-general,  who  shall immediately bring an action in the name of
  the people of the state, for the forfeiture of the charter or  franchise
  of  any  corporation  failing to make such payment, or file such report,
  and if it be found that such failure was intentional, judgment shall  be
  rendered  in  such action for the forfeiture of such charter and for its
  dissolution if a domestic corporation and if a foreign  corporation  for
  the annulment of its franchise to do business in this state.
    2.  Whenever any corporation has failed to file an annual report for a
  period of two consecutive years or has been delinquent in the payment of
  taxes  for  any  two  years  duly  assessed  pursuant to this article or
  article nine-a of the tax law heretofore in effect,  all  the  authority
  and powers conferred on the tax commission and the secretary of state by
  section two hundred three-a of this chapter and all of the provisions of
  such section shall have full force and effect in respect of and shall be
  applicable to such corporation.
    3.    Whenever  any  foreign  corporation has failed to file an annual
  report or has been delinquent in the  payment  of  taxes  duly  assessed
  pursuant   to  this  article  for  the  periods  of  time  specified  in
  subdivision two of this section, all the authority and powers  conferred

   §  219.  Limitation of time.  The provisions of the civil practice law
  and rules relative to the limitation of time of enforcing a civil remedy
  shall not apply to any proceeding or action  taken  to  levy,  appraise,
  assess,  determine  or  enforce  the  collection  of  any tax or penalty
  prescribed by this article, provided, however, that as to real estate in
  the hands of persons who are owners thereof who would be  purchasers  in

  may  be  requested,  within the time provided for by section two hundred
  fifty-seven-a or two hundred sixty-three of this article,  as  the  case
  may  be, by a party to the instrument or person interested therein or in

  person  who  has so requested such review or, in the case of such review
  initiated by the commissioner of taxation and finance, the party to  the
  instrument  or  person  interested  therein  or in the property affected
  thereby, and (ii) the city of New York, or the county treasurer, as  the
  case  may be, to whom the tax imposed by this article may be payable, of
  his determination. Such determination shall  be  fixed  and  irrevocable
  unless  within  ninety  days of the mailing of such notice, the party or
  person, who has so requested such review, or, in the case of such review
  initiated by the commissioner of taxation and finance, any party to  the
  instrument  or  person  interested  therein  or in the property affected
  thereby, or the city of New York, or the county treasurer, as  the  case

  petition, upon the commissioner of taxation and  finance  and  upon  the
  city  of  New  York or upon the county treasurer, as the case may be, to
  whom such tax may be payable. The administrative law  judge  shall  take
  such  proofs  as  may  be  necessary  to establish a complete record and
  thereupon issue his determination. After such hearing, the  division  of
  tax appeals shall give notice of the determination of the administrative
  law  judge  to  such party or person who so filed such petition, to such
  city or such county treasurer and to the commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance. Such determination may be reviewed by the tax appeals tribunal,
  as  provided  in  article  forty of this chapter, at the instance of any
  party to such hearing, and by  the  city  of  New  York  or  the  county
  treasurer,  as  the  case  may  be, to whom such tax may be payable. The
  decision of the tax appeals tribunal may  be  reviewed  as  provided  in
  section two thousand sixteen of this chapter except that the city of New
  York  or  the county treasurer, as the case may be, to whom such tax may
  be payable, may also apply for judicial review. The provisions  of  this
  section  shall  be  construed  as amplifying and extending the rights of
  review expressly provided in other sections of this article,  and  shall
  in no manner be deemed a restriction thereof.

  hundred fifty-four of the general municipal law. The imposition of  this
  additional tax on mortgages recorded in a county outside the city of New

  by registered or certified mail within a period of not less than  thirty
  days  prior  to  such  effective  date  if  it  deems  such action to be
  consistent with its duties under this article. A certified copy  of  any
  local  law, ordinance or resolution adopted pursuant to this subdivision
  shall also be filed with the state comptroller within  five  days  after
  the date it is duly adopted.

  seventy-five  thousand  dollars  for the administrative expenses of such
  committee and fifty thousand dollars for  the  expenses  of  the  agency
  designated  pursuant to paragraph b of subdivision five of such section,

  dollar,  for  each one hundred dollars and each remaining major fraction
  thereof  of  principal  debt  or  obligation,  the  principal  debt   or
  obligation  which is or under any contingency may be secured at the date

  any contingency may be secured at the date of execution thereof,  or  at
  any  time  thereafter,  by any other mortgage, where such mortgages form
  part of the same or related transactions and have the  same  or  related
  mortgagors.  If  the  commissioner  of taxation and finance finds that a
  mortgage transaction or mortgage transactions have been  formulated  for
  the  purpose  of  avoiding  or  evading  a  rate of tax authorized to be
  imposed under subdivision one of this section in excess  of  the  lowest
  such  authorized rate, rather than solely for an independent business or
  financial purpose, such commissioner shall treat all  of  the  mortgages
  forming  part  of  such transaction or transactions as a single mortgage
  for the purpose of determining the applicable rate of tax. For  purposes
  of  this  subdivision,  there  shall be a presumption that all mortgages
  offered for recording within  a  period  of  twelve  consecutive  months
  having the same or related mortgagors are part of a related transaction,
  and  such  presumption  may  be  rebutted only with clear and convincing
  evidence to the contrary. The commissioner of taxation and  finance  may
  require  such  affidavits  and  forms,  and may prescribe such rules and
  regulations, as he determines to be necessary to enforce the  provisions
  of this subdivision.
    (b)  The  term "related", when used in this subdivision with reference
  to mortgagors, shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following
  relationships:
    (i)  members  of  a  family,  including  spouses,  ancestors,   lineal
  descendants,  and  brothers  and  sisters  (whether by the whole or half
  blood);
    (ii) a shareholder and a corporation more than fifty  percent  of  the
  value  of the outstanding stock of which is owned or controlled directly
  or indirectly by such shareholder;
    (iii) a partner and a partnership  more  than  fifty  percent  of  the
  capital  or profits interest in which is owned or controlled directly or
  indirectly by such partner;


   (iv) a beneficiary  and  a  trust  more  than  fifty  percent  of  the
  beneficial  interest  in  which  is  owned  or  controlled  directly  or
  indirectly by such beneficiary;
    (v)  two  or more corporations, partnerships, associations, or trusts,
  or any combination  thereof,  which  are  owned  or  controlled,  either
  directly or indirectly, by the same person, corporation or other entity,
  or interests; and
    (vi) a grantor of a trust and such trust.
    * 4.  The  taxes  imposed under the authority of this section shall be
  administered and collected in the same manner as the taxes imposed under
  subdivision one of section two hundred fifty-three and paragraph (b)  of
  subdivision  one  of  section  two  hundred  fifty-five of this chapter.
  Except as otherwise provided in this section, all the provisions of this
  article relating to or applicable to the administration  and  collection
  of  the  taxes  imposed  by  such  subdivisions shall apply to the taxes
  imposed under the authority of this section with such  modifications  as
  may  be  necessary to adapt such language to the tax so authorized. Such
  provisions shall apply with the  same  force  and  effect  as  if  those
  provisions  had  been  set  forth  in full in this section except to the
  extent that any provision is either inconsistent  with  a  provision  of
  this  section or not relevant to the tax authorized by this section. For
  purposes of this section, any reference in this article to  the  tax  or
  taxes  imposed by this article shall be deemed to refer to a tax imposed
  pursuant to this section, and any reference to the phrase  "within  this
  state"  shall  be  read  as  "within  a  city imposing a tax pursuant to
  section two  hundred  fifty-three-a",  unless  a  different  meaning  is
  clearly required.
    * NB Amended as sub 4;should be sub 3
    4.  Where the real property covered by the mortgage subject to the tax
  imposed pursuant to the authority of this section is  situated  in  this
  state  but  within  and  without a city imposing such tax, the amount of
  such tax due and payable to such city shall be determined  in  a  manner
  similar to that prescribed in the first paragraph of section two hundred
  sixty  which  concerns  real  property situated in two or more counties.
  Where such property is situated both within such city  and  without  the
  state,  the  amount  due and payable to such city shall be determined in
  the manner prescribed in the second paragraph  of  section  two  hundred
  sixty  which  concerns  property  situated within and without the state.
  Where real property is situated within and  without  the  city  imposing
  such  tax,  the  recording  officer  of  the  jurisdiction  in which the
  mortgage is first recorded  shall  be  required  to  collect  the  taxes
  imposed pursuant to this section.
    5. A tax imposed pursuant to the authority of this section shall be in
  addition to the taxes imposed by section two hundred fifty-three.
    6.  Any  local  law  imposing  a tax pursuant to the authority of this
  section or repealing or suspending such a tax shall take effect only  on
  the  first  day  of  a  calendar  month.  Such  a local law shall not be
  effective unless a certified copy thereof is  mailed  by  registered  or
  certified  mail  to  the state tax commission at its office in Albany at
  least sixty days prior to the date the  local  law  shall  take  effect.
  However,  the  tax commission may waive and reduce such sixty-day notice
  requirement to a requirement that  such  certified  copy  be  mailed  by
  registered  or  certified  mail  within a period of not less than thirty
  days prior to such  effective  date  if  it  deems  such  action  to  be
  consistent with its duties under this section.
    7.  Certified  copies of any local law described in this section shall
  also be filed with the city clerk, the secretary of state and the  state
  comptroller within five days after the date it is duly enacted.




   §  253-b. Credit line mortgage.  1. In the case of a mortgage which is
  a credit line mortgage, as defined in subdivision two of  this  section,
  of  real property principally improved or to be improved by a one to six
  family owner-occupied residence  or  dwelling,  the  principal  debt  or
  obligation  which is or under any contingency may be secured at the date
  of execution of such mortgage or  at  any  time  thereafter  within  the
  meaning  of  this  article  shall  mean  the  maximum  principal  amount
  specified in such mortgage. If the tax imposed by and  pursuant  to  the
  authority  of  this article is paid on such maximum principal amount, no
  further tax shall be payable on advances or  readvances  by  the  lender
  pursuant  to  the  recorded  primary mortgage, provided such advances or
  readvances are made to the original obligor or obligors  named  in  such
  recorded primary mortgage.  In the event the maximum principal amount of
  a  credit  line  mortgage  is increased, a tax is imposed as provided in
  section two hundred fifty-three and pursuant to the authority of section
  two hundred fifty-three-a  of  this  article  on  such  new  or  further
  indebtedness  or  obligation when the instrument evidencing such further
  indebtedness is recorded. In order to better enforce the  provisions  of
  this  subdivision  and  for  the  privilege  of  recording an instrument
  evidencing a sale or transfer of real property on which the  lien  of  a
  credit  line  mortgage  remains  outstanding, in the event that a credit
  line mortgage remains outstanding after the sale or transfer of the real
  property securing the credit line mortgage to a person or persons who is
  or are not related  to  the  original  obligor  or  obligors  by  blood,
  marriage  or  adoption,  or where such credit line mortgage that remains
  outstanding after such sale or transfer is a  credit  line  mortgage  of
  property other than real property principally improved or to be improved
  by  a  one to six family owner-occupied residence or dwelling, taxes are
  imposed at the rates applicable under section  two  hundred  fifty-three
  and  pursuant  to  the authority of section two hundred fifty-three-a on
  the principal debt or obligation which is or under any  contingency  may
  be  secured  at  the  date  when  the  instrument evidencing the sale or
  transfer is recorded and no such instrument shall be recorded until  the
  taxes imposed in this section are paid.
    1-a.  In  the  case  of a mortgage which is a credit line mortgage, as
  defined in subdivision two of this section, of property other than  real
  property  principally  improved or to be improved by a one to six family
  owner-occupied residence or dwelling, and where such mortgage is  of  an
  amount  less than three million dollars, the tax imposed by and pursuant
  to the authority of this article shall be imposed and paid  pursuant  to
  the provisions of subdivision one of this section.
    2.  For  the  purposes of this section, a "credit line mortgage" shall
  mean any mortgage or deed of trust, other than a  mortgage  or  deed  of
  trust   made  pursuant  to  a  building  loan  contract  as  defined  in
  subdivision thirteen of section two of the lien law, which  states  that
  it  secures  indebtedness  under  a  note,  credit  agreement  or  other
  financing agreement that reflects the fact that the  parties  reasonably
  contemplate  entering  into  a series of advances, or advances, payments
  and readvances, and  that  limits  the  aggregate  amount  at  any  time
  outstanding  to  a  maximum amount specified in such mortgage or deed of
  trust. For the purpose of this section, "credit line mortgage" shall not
  include a reverse mortgage as defined in sections two hundred eighty and
  two hundred eighty-a of the real property law.
    3. The commissioner shall promulgate regulations to  provide  for  the
  enforcement  and  administration  of the taxes imposed by or pursuant to

  during the period beginning September first, nineteen hundred ninety-two
  and  ending  the  earlier  of  August  thirty-first,  nineteen   hundred
  ninety-eight  or  the last day of the month next succeeding the month in

  thereof,  or  at  any  time  thereafter,  by a mortgage on real property
  situated within such county and recorded on or after the date upon which
  such tax takes effect and a tax of one dollar on such  mortgage  if  the

  Except as otherwise provided in this section, all the provisions of this
  article  relating  to or applicable to the administration and collection
  of the taxes imposed by such  subdivisions  shall  apply  to  the  taxes

  may be necessary to adapt such language to the tax so  authorized.  Such
  provisions  shall  apply  with  the  same  force  and effect as if those
  provisions had been set forth in full in  this  section  except  to  the
  extent  that  any  provision  is either inconsistent with a provision of
  this section or not relevant to the tax authorized by this section.  For

  meaning is clearly required.
    3.  Where the real property covered by the mortgage subject to the tax
  imposed pursuant to the authority of this section is  situated  in  this
  state  but  within and without a county imposing such tax, the amount of
  such tax due and payable to such county shall be determined in a  manner
  similar to that prescribed in the first paragraph of section two hundred
  sixty  of  this  chapter which concerns real property situated in two or
  more counties. Where such property is situated both within  such  county
  and  without  the state, the amount due and payable to such county shall
  be determined in the manner prescribed in the second paragraph  of  such
  section  two  hundred  sixty which concerns property situated within and

  Nassau during each month upon account of the tax imposed pursuant to the
  authority of this section, after deducting the necessary expenses of his
  office  as  provided  in  section two hundred sixty-two of this chapter,
  except taxes paid upon mortgages which  under  the  provisions  of  this
  section  or  section  two  hundred sixty of this chapter are first to be
  apportioned by the commissioner of taxation and finance, shall  be  paid


 over by such officer on or before the tenth day of each succeeding month
  to  the  county  treasurer  of Nassau county and, after the deduction by
  such county treasurer of the necessary expenses of  his  or  her  office
  provided  in section two hundred sixty-two of this chapter shall: (i) if
  paid to such recording  officer  during  the  first  sixteen  months  of
  imposition  of such tax, be deposited in the general fund of such county
  for expenditure on  county  purposes;  (ii)  if  so  paid  at  any  time
  thereafter,  be deposited in a special fund, to be designated the Nassau
  county deficit bond fund, to be created by the county of Nassau separate
  and  apart  from  any  other  funds  and   accounts   of   the   county.
  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  the preceding sentence, the tax so
  imposed and paid upon mortgages covering real property situated  in  two
  or  more counties, which under the provisions of this section or section
  two hundred sixty of this chapter are first to  be  apportioned  by  the
  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance,  shall  be  paid  over  by the
  recording officer receiving the same as provided by the determination of
  said commissioner.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, moneys in the Nassau
  county bond deficit fund may be appropriated from and transferred to  or
  expended  in  any  fiscal  year  only  for the purpose of payment of the
  principal of and interest on bonds and notes authorized by a chapter  of
  the  laws  of  nineteen hundred ninety-two, entitled "AN ACT authorizing
  the county of Nassau to issue  serial  bonds  and/or  bond  anticipation
  notes  for  the  purpose of liquidating deficits in the county's general
  fund and to amend the tax law, in relation to authorizing the county  of
  Nassau  to  impose  a  county  recording tax on obligations secured by a
  mortgage on real property; to amend the county government law of  Nassau
  county  (Nassau  County  Charter)  and  the Nassau county administrative
  code, in relation to the imposition of an exigency tax". When the amount
  of moneys in such fund is sufficient to pay all future debt  service  on
  such  notes  and bonds, the comptroller of the county of Nassau shall so
  notify the commissioner of taxation and finance by certified mail.  When
  no such bonds or notes remain outstanding, such fund shall terminate and
  moneys  remaining therein shall be deposited in the general fund of such
  county for expenditure on county purposes.
    6. Any local law imposing a tax pursuant  to  the  authority  of  this

  than a mortgage specified in section two hundred and sixty-four has been
  recorded prior to July first, nineteen hundred and six, the record owner
  thereof may file with the recording officer of the county in  which  the
  real property, or any part thereof, on which said mortgage is a lien, is
  situated, a written statement under oath verified by the record owner or
  the  agent  or  officer of such record owner describing such mortgage by
  giving the date of the same and the liber and page of the record thereof
  together with the names of the parties thereto,  specifying  the  amount
  then  remaining  unpaid  on  the debt or obligation secured thereby, and
  electing that it shall become subject to the tax prescribed  by  section
  two  hundred  and  fifty-three  of this chapter. Whenever any unrecorded
  mortgage has been executed and delivered prior to July  first,  nineteen
  hundred  and six, the owner thereof may record the same upon filing with
  the recording officer a similar statement and paying the tax  as  herein
  prescribed. A tax shall thereupon be computed, levied and collected upon
  the amount of the principal debt or obligation unpaid at the time of the
  filing  of  such  statement,  or  of  the recording of such mortgage and
  filing of such statement. On the payment of such tax as herein provided,
  the recording officer shall note on the margin of  the  record  of  such
  mortgage  the  fact of such statement and of the amount of the tax paid,
  attested by his signature, whereupon  such  mortgage  and  the  debt  or
  obligation  secured  thereby  shall  be  entitled  to the exemptions and
  immunities conferred by this article, and all of the provisions of  this
  article  shall  thereafter  be applicable to said mortgage. Whenever the
  original mortgage is presented to the clerk together with the  statement
  he  shall  also note on said original mortgage the fact of the filing of
  the said statement and also the amount of the tax paid duly attested  by
  his  signature,  which  indorsement  shall be conclusive evidence of the

   §  255.  Supplemental  mortgages.  1.  (a)  (i)  If  subsequent to the
  recording of a mortgage on which all taxes, if any, accrued  under  this
  article  have  been  paid,  a  supplemental  instrument  or  mortgage is
  recorded for the  purpose  of  correcting  or  perfecting  any  recorded
  mortgage,  or  pursuant  to  some  provision  or covenant therein, or an
  additional mortgage is recorded imposing the lien thereof upon  property
  not  originally  covered  by  or  not described in such recorded primary
  mortgage for the purpose of securing the principal indebtedness which is
  or under any  contingency  may  be  secured  by  such  recorded  primary
  mortgage, such additional instrument or mortgage shall not be subject to
  taxation  under  this article, except as otherwise provided in paragraph
  (b) of this subdivision, unless it creates or secures a new  or  further
  indebtedness  or  obligation  other  than  the principal indebtedness or
  obligation secured by or which under any contingency may be  secured  by
  the  recorded  primary  mortgage,  in  which  case,  a tax is imposed as
  provided by section two hundred and fifty-three of this article on  such
  new or further indebtedness or obligation.
    (ii) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in subparagraph (i)
  of  this paragraph, the taxes imposed by or pursuant to the authority of
  this article shall apply to the recording of a  spreading  agreement  or
  additional  mortgage  which  imposes the lien thereof upon real property
  located in any city in the state having a population of one  million  or
  more  and  not  originally covered by or described in a recorded primary
  mortgage, unless the real property that becomes subject to the  lien  of
  such  spreading  agreement  or  additional  mortgage  is  owned  by  the
  mortgagor of the real property subject to  the  lien  of  such  recorded
  primary mortgage. If the commissioner of taxation and finance finds that
  transfers  of  one  or  both  of  such properties in connection with the
  recording of the spreading agreement or additional  mortgage  have  been
  undertaken  for  the  purpose  of avoiding or evading the application of
  this paragraph  rather  than  solely  for  an  independent  business  or
  financial  purpose,  such commissioner may disregard such transfers. For
  purposes of this subparagraph, there shall be  a  presumption  that  all
  transfers  of  one  or both of such properties to related parties within
  the twelve-month  period  preceding  the  recording  of  such  spreading
  agreement  or additional mortgage have been undertaken for tax avoidance
  or evasion purposes and such presumption may be rebutted only with clear
  and convincing evidence to the contrary.  For  this  purpose,  the  term
  "related" shall have the same meaning as in paragraph (b) of subdivision
  two  of  section  two  hundred fifty-three-a of this article except that
  references to "fifty percent" in such paragraph (b)  shall  be  read  as
  "twenty-five percent".
    (b)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in paragraph (a) of
  this subdivision, taxes are imposed at the rates specified in  paragraph
  (a)  of  subdivision  two  of  section  two  hundred fifty-three of this
  chapter for each one hundred dollars and each remaining  major  fraction
  thereof  of  principal  indebtedness  or  obligation secured by or which
  under any contingency may be secured by  a  supplemental  instrument  or
  additional  mortgage,  whether  or  not  there  is  any  new  or further
  indebtedness or obligation other  than  the  principal  indebtedness  or
  obligation  secured  by  the  recorded  primary  mortgage, where (i) the
  supplemental instrument or additional mortgage imposes  the  lien  of  a
  recorded  mortgage  upon  real  property  not  previously subject to the
  mortgage or where an additional mortgage upon such  additional  property
  is  recorded  as  additional  or substitute security for indebtedness or
  obligation already secured by a recorded mortgage and such  property  is
  situated  in  a county where the tax imposed by such paragraph (a) is in
  effect and (ii) the recorded  primary  mortgage  was  on  real  property


 situated  in  a  county  which  had  suspended  the  tax imposed by such
  paragraph (a) and the mortgage was recorded without payment of such tax.
  The taxes imposed by this subdivision shall be distributed  pursuant  to
  section  two  hundred  sixty-one of this chapter in the same manner as a
  tax imposed by subdivision two of section  two  hundred  fifty-three  of
  this chapter.
    (c)  The  taxes  imposed  by  this section shall be paid to the proper
  recording officer at the time the supplemental instrument or  additional
  mortgage is recorded.
    2.  (a)  If,  at  the  time of recording such instrument or additional
  mortgage, any exemption is claimed under this section,  there  shall  be
  filed with the recording officer and preserved in his office a statement
  under  oath of the facts on which such claim for exemption is based. The
  determination of the recording officer upon the  question  of  exemption
  shall be reviewable by the tax commission.
    (b)  If  an exemption is claimed under this section, at any time after
  such instrument or additional mortgage is recorded and tax  paid,  there
  shall  be  filed with the tax commission, as part of the application for
  refund a statement under oath of the  facts  on  which  such  claim  for
  exemption  is based. A copy of the order of refund of the tax commission
  shall likewise be filed with the recording officer and preserved in  his
  office.


   § 256.  Mortgages  for indefinite amounts or for contract obligations.
  If the principal indebtedness secured or which by any contingency may be
  secured by a  mortgage  is  not  determinable  from  the  terms  of  the
  mortgage,  or  if  a  mortgage is given to secure the performance by the
  mortgagor or any other person of a contract obligation  other  than  the
  payment  of  a  specific  sum of money and the maximum amount secured or
  which by any contingency may be secured by the mortgage is not expressed
  therein, such mortgage shall be taxable under section  two  hundred  and
  fifty-three  of  this  chapter upon the value of the property covered by
  the mortgage, which shall be determined by the recording officer to whom
  such mortgage is presented for record, unless at the time of  presenting
  such mortgage for record the owner thereof shall file with the recording
  officer  a  sworn statement of the maximum amount secured or which under
  any contingency may be secured by the mortgage. If such  maximum  amount
  is  expressed  in the mortgage or in a sworn statement filed as required
  by this section, such amount shall be the basis for  assessing  the  tax
  imposed  by  this  article. A statement filed by the owner of a mortgage
  pursuant to this section shall thereafter at all times be  binding  upon
  and  conclusive  against  such  owner,  the  holders  of  any  bonds  or
  obligations secured by such mortgage and all  persons  claiming  through
  the mortgagee any interest in the mortgage or the mortgaged premises. If
  the maximum amount secured or which by any contingency may be secured by
  the mortgage is not expressed in the mortgage or in a sworn statement as
  authorized  by  this  section,  the  recording  officer at the time such
  mortgage is offered for record may require the mortgagor or mortgagee to
  furnish him with proofs as to such facts as he deems necessary  for  the
  purpose  of  computing the value of the property covered by the mortgage
  and such proofs shall include an affidavit of appraisal of the value  of
  the  property  made by at least two competent, disinterested persons and
  shall be preserved in his office. His determination and  copies  of  the
  proofs  as  to the basis for computing the tax on such mortgage shall be
  forwarded to and subject to review by the  state  tax  commission.  Such
  mortgage  shall  not  be  recorded  until  the statement is filed or the
  proofs are furnished as required by this article.
    Whenever any such  mortgage  shall  have  been  recorded  without  the
  payment  of  the  tax  as  herein  provided,  and it shall thereafter be
  determined by the tax commission, after an opportunity to  be  heard  by
  the  parties in interest, that the failure to pay such tax was due to an
  honest misconception on the part of the recording officer or  the  owner
  of the instrument as to the nature of such instrument and its taxability
  under  this article, the tax commission may make an order permitting the
  recording officer to file the aforesaid statement nunc pro  tunc  as  of
  the date of the recording of the mortgage. The payment of the tax may be
  made on the basis of such statement with interest thereon at the rate of
  six  per  centum  per  annum  as  provided  in  section  two hundred and
  fifty-eight of this article.




   § 257.  Payment  of  taxes. The taxes imposed by this article shall be
  payable on the recording of each mortgage of real  property  subject  to
  taxes  thereunder.  Such taxes shall be paid to the recording officer of
  any county in which the real property or any part thereof  is  situated.
  It  shall  be  the  duty  of such recording officer to indorse upon each
  mortgage a receipt for the amount of the tax so paid.  Any  mortgage  so
  indorsed  may  thereupon  or  thereafter  be  recorded  by any recording
  officer and the receipt for such tax indorsed upon each  mortgage  shall
  be  recorded  therewith.  The record of such receipt shall be conclusive
  proof that the amount of tax stated therein  has  been  paid  upon  such
  mortgage.




   § 257-a.  Refund  of mortgage taxes after rescission of certain credit
  transactions. 1.  As  used  in  this  section,  a  "statutory  right  of
  rescission"  means  the right of an obligor to rescind a consumer credit
  transaction in which a security  interest,  including  a  real  property
  mortgage,  is retained or acquired in any real property which is used or
  expected to be used as a  residence  of  the  obligor  provided  for  in
  section  one  hundred  twenty-five  of  title one, the "Truth in Lending
  Act," of the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (Public Law  90-321;
  82  Stat.  146  et  seq.)  and in the regulations issued by the Board of
  Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to said title  of  said
  act.
    2.  A  person  who  has  paid the taxes imposed by this article on the
  recording of a mortgage of real property has a right to a refund of  the
  mortgage  taxes  so  paid if a mortgagor upon the mortgage exercises the
  statutory right of rescission with respect thereto and  a  discharge  of
  the mortgage has been recorded.
    3.  The  State Tax Commission shall provide by regulation how a person
  having a right to a refund of mortgage taxes pursuant to subsection  two
  may  obtain  the  refund  and the cities, towns, villages or officers to
  which or to whom the mortgage tax moneys  have  been  paid,  paid  over,
  distributed,  or  allotted  shall  refund  such mortgage tax moneys to a
  person having a right to the refund thereof.




   §  258. Effect of nonpayment of taxes. 1. No mortgage of real property
  shall be recorded by any county clerk or register, unless there shall be
  paid the taxes imposed by and as in this article provided.  No  mortgage
  of  real  property which is subject to the taxes imposed by this article
  shall be released, discharged of record or received in evidence  in  any
  action or proceeding, nor shall any assignment of or agreement extending
  any  such  mortgage be recorded unless the taxes imposed thereon by this
  article shall have been paid as  provided  in  this  article.  Provided,
  however,  except  as  otherwise  provided  in  subdivision  two  of this
  section, in order to obtain a release or discharge of record  where  the
  mortgagor  is  not  liable  for the special additional tax imposed under
  subdivision one-a of section two hundred fifty-three  of  this  chapter,
  such  mortgagor  or  any subsequent owner of the mortgaged property or a
  part thereof may pay the tax imposed under such  subdivision  one-a  and
  penalty,  and  may  either  apply  for  the  credit allowable under this
  chapter for payment of such additional tax or may maintain an action  to
  recover the amounts so paid against any person liable for payment of the
  tax   or  any  subsequent  assignees  or  owners  of  such  mortgage  or
  consolidated mortgage of which such mortgage  is  a  part,  as  if  such
  amounts  of  tax and penalty were a debt personally owed by such persons
  to the mortgagor or subsequent owner.  No judgment or final order in any
  action  or  proceeding  shall  be  made  for  the  foreclosure  or   the
  enforcement  of any mortgage which is subject to any tax imposed by this
  article or of any debt or  obligation  secured  by  any  such  mortgage,
  unless  the  taxes  imposed  by  this  article  shall  have been paid as
  provided in this article; and, except otherwise provided in  subdivision
  two of this section, whenever it shall appear that any mortgage has been
  recorded without payment of a tax imposed by this article there shall be
  added  to  the tax a sum equal to one-half of one per centum thereof for
  each month or fraction of a month for the period that  the  tax  remains
  unpaid  except  where  it  could  not be determined from the face of the
  instrument that a tax was due, or where an advance has been  made  on  a
  prior  advance mortgage or a corporate trust mortgage without payment of
  the tax, in which case there shall be added to the tax a  sum  equal  to
  one  per  centum  thereof  for each month or fraction of a month for the
  period that the tax remains unpaid. In any case where a mortgage of real
  property subject to a tax imposed by this article  has  heretofore  been
  recorded or is hereafter recorded in good faith, and the county clerk or
  register has held such mortgage nontaxable or taxable at one amount, and
  it  shall  later  appear  that  it  was  taxable or taxable at a greater
  amount, the commissioner of taxation and finance may remit the penalties
  in excess of one-half of one per centum per month.
    2. In any city in this state having a population  of  one  million  or
  more,  in  order  to  obtain  a release or discharge of record where the
  mortgagor is not liable for the special  additional  tax  imposed  under
  subdivision  one-a  of  section two hundred fifty-three of this chapter,
  such mortgagor or any subsequent owner of the mortgaged  property  or  a
  part  thereof  may pay the tax imposed under such subdivision one-a with
  accrued interest and any penalties, and may either apply for the  credit
  allowable  under  this chapter for payment of such additional tax or may
  maintain an action to recover the amounts so  paid  against  any  person
  liable  for  payment of the tax or any subsequent assignees or owners of
  such mortgage or consolidated mortgage of which such mortgage is a part,
  as if such amounts of tax and penalties were a debt personally  owed  by
  such  persons to the mortgagor or subsequent owner. No judgment or final
  order in any action or proceeding shall be made for the  foreclosure  or
  the  enforcement  of any mortgage which is subject to any tax imposed by
  this article or of any debt or obligation secured by any such  mortgage,


 unless  the  taxes  imposed  by  this  article  shall  have been paid as
  provided in this article; and whenever it shall appear that any mortgage
  has been recorded without payment of a tax imposed by this article there
  shall  be  added  to the tax interest on the amount of tax not paid. The
  commissioner of taxation and finance shall set the rate of  interest  to
  be  paid  on any underpayment of tax imposed by this article at the rate
  of interest  prescribed  in  subsection  (e)  of  section  one  thousand
  ninety-six of this chapter for underpayments of tax. Such interest shall
  be compounded daily. In addition to interest there shall be added to the
  tax  a  penalty  of  ten  percent of the amount of tax due for the first
  month of delay in payment of the tax plus two percent of the  amount  of
  tax  for  each month of delay thereafter, up to a maximum of twenty-five
  percent, where  it  could  not  be  determined  from  the  face  of  the
  instrument  that  a  tax was due, or where an advance has been made on a
  prior advance mortgage or a corporate trust mortgage or a re-advance had
  been made on a mortgage where the original indebtedness it  secured  had
  been  paid  in  whole  or  in part. In any case where a mortgage of real
  property subject to a tax imposed by this article  has  heretofore  been
  recorded or is hereafter recorded in good faith, and the county clerk or
  register has held such mortgage nontaxable or taxable at one amount, and
  it  shall  later  appear  that  it  was  taxable or taxable at a greater
  amount, the commissioner of taxation and finance may remit the penalties
  but not interest.


   § 258-a.  Payment  of  tax  on instruments not recorded. An instrument
  taxable under this article but which is not entitled to be recorded, may
  nevertheless be presented to the recording  officer  of  the  county  in
  which  the real property or any part thereof affected by said instrument
  is situated, and there may be paid to such officer the amount of the tax
  which would be payable under this  article  on  the  recording  of  such
  instrument  if the same were entitled to be recorded. Such officer shall
  receive such amount and such payment  shall  have  the  same  force  and
  effect,  so  far as this article is concerned, as if such instrument had
  been duly recorded and the tax thereon paid. It shall be the duty of the
  recording officer to indorse upon  the  instrument  a  receipt  for  the
  amount  of the tax so paid. A copy of each instrument upon which the tax
  is paid as above provided shall be filed with the recording officer  and
  preserved among his mortgage tax records.
    Where  an  unrecorded  instrument  subject  to the tax imposed by this
  article  has  been  lost  or  destroyed,  the   tax   commission,   upon
  presentation  of proper proofs, may determine the taxable amount of such
  instrument and by order authorize the recording officer to  receive  and
  receipt for such tax as fully and with the same force and effect, so far
  as  this  article  is  concerned,  as  if  the  instrument had been duly
  recorded and the tax thereon paid.
    The filing or recording of a notice of the payment of tax  under  this
  section  is  ineffective  to  give notice under article nine of the real
  property law of any estate or interest in the real property affected  by
  the instrument on which tax is being paid or to create a duty of inquiry
  with regard thereto.




   §  259. Trust mortgages. In the case of mortgages made by corporations
  in trust to secure payment of bonds  or  obligations  issued  or  to  be
  issued  thereafter,  if the total amount of principal indebtedness which
  under any contingency may be advanced or accrued  or  which  may  become
  secured  by  any  such mortgage which is subject to this article has not
  been advanced or accrue thereon or become secured  thereby  before  such
  mortgage  is  recorded, it may contain at the end thereof a statement of
  the amount which at the time of the execution and delivery  thereof  has
  been  advanced  or  accrued  thereon,  or  which is then secured by such
  mortgage; thereupon the tax payable on the  recording  of  the  mortgage
  shall  be  computed on the basis of the amount so stated to have been so
  advanced or accrued thereon or which is stated to  be  secured  thereby.
  Such  statement  shall  thereafter  at  all  times  be  binding upon and
  conclusive  against  the  mortgagee,  the  holders  of  any   bonds   or
  obligations  secured  by  such mortgage and all persons claiming through
  the mortgagee any interest in the mortgage or in the mortgaged premises.
  Whenever a further amount is to be advanced under the original mortgage,
  or shall accrue thereon  or  become  secured  thereby,  the  corporation
  making  such  mortgage shall pay the tax on such amount at or before the
  time when such amount is to be advanced, accrues or becomes secured  and
  shall,  at  the  time  of  paying  such  tax,  file in the office of the
  recording officer where such mortgage has been or is first recorded  and
  with  the  tax  commission  a  statement,  verified  by  the  secretary,
  treasurer or other proper officer, of said corporation of the amount  of
  principal  indebtedness to be so advanced, accruing or becoming secured,
  and the certification of any bond or bonds by the trust mortgagee  shall
  be  deemed  an  advance under this article. Such additional tax shall be
  paid to the recording officer where such mortgage has been or  is  first
  recorded  and a receipt therefor shall be endorsed upon the mortgage and
  payment therefor shall be noted in the margin  of  the  record  of  such
  mortgage  and  if  requested  a duplicate receipt for such payment shall
  also be given to the party paying such tax and the note of such  payment
  or  additional  payment  or  such  receipt shall have the same force and
  effect as the record of receipt of the tax which under this  article  is
  payable  at  or before the recording of the mortgage. If such additional
  tax is not paid as required by this section, the trust  mortgagee  shall
  not  certify any bond or other obligation issued on account thereof. The
  corporation making such mortgage or the  owner  of  the  property  which
  secures  the  mortgage debt shall annually within thirty days after July
  first, and until it shall appear by  such  statement  that  the  maximum
  amount  of  principal  indebtedness  secured  by  such mortgage has been
  advanced, has accrued or become secured and the tax thereon  paid,  file
  in the office of the tax commission and the recording officer where such
  mortgage  has  been  or  is  first recorded a statement, verified by the
  secretary, treasurer  or  other  proper  officer  of  said  corporation,
  showing:
    1. The name of the mortgagor and the mortgagee;
    2. The date of the mortgage and the county where first recorded;
    3.  The maximum amount of principal debt or obligation which under any
  contingency may be secured by such mortgage;
    4. The amount advanced on such mortgage during the  year  ending  June
  thirtieth preceding, with the date and amount of each advancement;
    5.  In  the  case of a mortgage recorded prior to July first, nineteen
  hundred and six, the first annual statement filed under this section  as
  hereby  amended,  shall  state  the  total amount advanced prior to July
  first, nineteen hundred and six, and the date and  the  amount  of  each
  subsequent  advancement  to  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  the
  statement.


   A failure to file any statement required by this  section  within  the
  specified time shall subject the corporation or other person required to
  file  such  statement  to a penalty of not less than one dollar nor more
  than one hundred dollars for each one thousand dollars  of  the  maximum
  amount  of  principal indebtedness which is or under any contingency may
  become secured by the mortgage, which penalty in the aggregate shall not
  exceed  the  sum  of  five  thousand   dollars,   recoverable   by   the
  attorney-general  in  an action brought in the name of the people of the
  state of New York.








   §  260.   Determination and apportionment by the state tax commission.
  When the real property covered by a mortgage is situated  in  more  than
  one  tax district, the state tax commission shall apportion the tax paid
  on such mortgage between the respective tax districts upon the basis  of
  the relative assessments of such real property as the same appear on the
  last  assessment-rolls.    If,  however,  the  whole  or any part of the
  property covered by such a  mortgage  is  not  assessed  upon  the  last
  assessment-roll or rolls of the tax district or districts in which it is
  situated,  or  is  so  assessed,  as  a part of a larger tract, that the
  assessed value cannot be determined, or if improvements have  been  made
  to  such  an extent as materially to change the value of the property so
  assessed, the tax commission may require  the  local  assessors  in  the
  respective  tax  districts,  or  the mortgagor, or mortgagee, to furnish
  sworn appraisals of the property in each tax  district,  and  upon  such
  appraisals  shall  determine the apportionment.  If such mortgage covers
  real property  in  two  or  more  counties,  the  tax  commission  shall
  determine the proportion of the tax which shall be paid by the recording
  officer who has received the same to the recording officers of the other
  counties  in  which  are  situated  the  tax districts entitled to share
  therein.  When any recording officer shall pay any portion of a  tax  to
  the  recording officer of another county, he shall forward with such tax
  a description sufficient to identify the mortgage on which the  tax  has
  been  paid,  and  the recording officer receiving such tax shall note on
  the margin of the record of such mortgage  the  fact  of  such  payment,
  attested  by  his signature.   The tax commission shall make an order of
  determination and apportionment in respect to  each  such  mortgage  and
  file  a certified copy thereof with the recording officer of each county
  in which a part of the mortgaged real property is situated.
    When the real property covered by a  mortgage  is  partly  within  the
  state  and  partly  without  the  state  it shall be the duty of the tax
  commission to determine what portion of the mortgage or of  advancements
  thereon  shall  be taxable under this article.  Such determination shall
  be made in the following manner:    First:    Determine  the  respective
  values  of  the  property  within  and  without  the  state,  and deduct
  therefrom the amount of any prior  existing  mortgage  liens,  excepting
  such  liens  as  are  to  be  replaced  by  prior  advancements  and the
  advancement under consideration.  Second:  Find the ratio that  the  net
  value  of the mortgaged property within the state bears to the net value
  of the entire mortgaged property.  Third:  Make the determination of the
  portion of the mortgage or of the advancements thereon  which  shall  be
  taxable  under  this  article  by  applying  the  ratio so found.   If a
  mortgage covering property partly within and partly without the state is
  presented for record before such determination has been made, or at  the
  time when an advance is made on a corporate trust mortgage or on a prior
  advance  mortgage,  there  may  be  presented to the recording officer a
  statement in duplicate verified by the mortgagor or an officer  or  duly
  authorized  agent  of the mortgagor, in which shall be specified the net
  value of the property within the state and the net value of the property
  without the state covered by such mortgage.    One  of  such  statements
  shall be filed by the recording officer and the other shall be forthwith
  transmitted  by  him to the state tax commission.  The tax payable under
  this article before the determination by the  tax  commission  shall  be
  computed  upon such portion of the principal indebtedness secured by the
  mortgage, or of the sum advanced  thereon,  as  the  net  value  of  the
  mortgaged property within the state bears to the net value of the entire
  mortgaged  property  as set forth in such statement.  The tax commission
  shall on receipt of the statement from the recording officer and on  not
  less  than  ten  days'  notice  served  personally  or  by mail upon the


 mortgagor, the mortgagee and the state comptroller, proceed to make  the
  required  determination.    In  determining  the  separate values of the
  property within and without the state the tax commission shall  consider
  only  the  tangible  property,  real and personal, except that leases of
  real property shall be deemed tangible property.   For  the  purpose  of
  determining  such  value the tax commission may require the mortgagor or
  mortgagee to furnish by affidavit or verified report such information or
  data as it may deem necessary, and may require and take the testimony of
  the mortgagor, mortgagee or any other person.  A certified copy  of  the
  order  of  determination and apportionment shall be delivered personally
  or by mail to the mortgagor, the mortgagee and  the  state  comptroller,
  and  any  tax  under such determination which has not been paid shall be
  paid within ten days after service of such certified copy; if,  however,
  the  tax paid at the time of filing the statement hereinbefore specified
  with the recording officer is in excess of  the  tax  determined  to  be
  payable, the certificate of determination and apportionment shall direct
  the recording officer to refund to the person paying such tax the amount
  of  such excess; provided that no refund shall be made of any taxes paid
  pursuant to a previous determination.
    The tax commission shall adopt rules to govern the procedure  and  the
  manner  of  taking  evidence  in  all  the  matters provided for by this
  section and may require verified statements to be  furnished  either  by
  boards   of  assessors,  recording  officers  or  other  persons  having
  knowledge in relation to such matters.   Failure  on  the  part  of  any
  person  or officer to furnish a statement or other data when required so
  to do pursuant to the provisions  of  this  section  shall  render  such
  person  or  officer  liable  to  a penalty of one hundred dollars, to be
  recovered by the attorney-general in an action brought in  the  name  of
  the people of the state of New York.
    In  making  determination and apportionment under this section the tax
  commission shall consider each advancement made upon  a  mortgage  after
  July  first,  nineteen hundred and six, as a new mortgage.  In all cases
  under this section where the provisions  for  distribution  of  the  tax
  among  tax  districts are inapplicable or inadequate, the tax commission
  shall establish a basis of apportionment  that  will  be  equitable  and
  fair.




   §  261.  Payment over and distribution of taxes. 1. The balance of all
  moneys paid to the recording officer of each county  during  each  month
  upon account of the additional taxes imposed pursuant to subdivision two
  of  section two hundred fifty-three of this article, after deducting the
  necessary expenses of his or her  office  as  provided  in  section  two
  hundred  sixty-two  of  this  article,  except taxes paid upon mortgages
  which under the provisions of section two hundred sixty of this  article
  are  first  to be apportioned by the commissioner, shall be paid over by
  him or her on or before the  tenth  day  of  each  succeeding  month  as
  follows:  (a) with respect to those counties comprising the metropolitan
  commuter transportation  district,  as  defined  by  the  provisions  of
  section  twelve  hundred sixty-two of the public authorities law, to the
  metropolitan transportation authority to be  applied  in  any  authority
  fiscal  year  beginning  on  or  after  January  first, nineteen hundred
  eighty-seven  (i)  first,  to  meet  the  general,  administrative   and
  operating  expenses  of  the authority net of reimbursements, recoveries
  and adjustments, not including the expenses of any subsidiaries  thereof
  which  operate  any  transportation  facility,  (ii)  second,  from  any
  remaining revenues, fifty-five per centum of such revenues shall be paid
  by the metropolitan transportation authority to the transit  account  of
  the   metropolitan  transportation  authority  special  assistance  fund
  established  by  section  twelve  hundred  seventy-a   of   the   public
  authorities  law; and (iii) the remaining forty-five per centum shall be
  paid by  the  metropolitan  transportation  authority  to  the  commuter
  railroad  account  of  the metropolitan transportation authority special
  assistance fund established by section twelve hundred seventy-a  of  the
  public  authorities  law;  (b) with respect to those counties comprising
  the  Niagara  Frontier  transportation  district,  as  defined  by   the
  provisions  of  section  twelve  hundred  ninety-nine-b  of  the  public
  authorities law, to the Niagara Frontier transportation  authority;  (c)
  with respect to those counties comprising the Rochester-Genesee regional
  transportation  district, as defined by the provisions of section twelve
  hundred  ninety-nine-cc  of  the  public   authorities   law,   to   the
  Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority; (d) with respect to
  those  counties comprising the capital district transportation district,
  as defined by the provisions of section  thirteen  hundred  two  of  the
  public   authorities   law,   to  the  capital  district  transportation
  authority; (e) with respect to those counties comprising the central New
  York regional transportation district, as defined by the  provisions  of
  section  thirteen hundred twenty-seven of the public authorities law, to
  the central New York regional transportation authority; (f) with respect
  to the county of Dutchess or the county  of  Orange  or  the  county  of

  county department of public works building, or debt service thereon less
  the amount of any state aid or federal funds  paid  or  to  be  paid  on
  account  of  such  project  or debt service thereon. Notwithstanding the
  provisions of the preceding sentence, additional taxes  so  imposed  and
  paid  upon  mortgages  covering  real  property  situated in two or more
  counties, which under the provisions of section  two  hundred  sixty  of
  this  article  are first to be apportioned by the commissioner, shall be
  paid over by the recording officer receiving the same as provided by the
  determination of said commissioner.
    If and to the extent that either metropolitan transportation authority
  or  Niagara  Frontier  transportation  authority  or   Rochester-Genesee
  regional  transportation  authority  or  capital district transportation
  authority or central New York regional  transportation  authority  shall
  certify  that the proceeds of such additional tax received by it for any
  calendar year subsequent to nineteen hundred sixty-nine are in excess of
  its needs, present  and  projected,  and  of  those  of  its  subsidiary
  corporations, such excess shall be paid over at the end of such calendar
  year  to  the  comptroller  for  payment or application by him or her in
  accordance with the provisions of paragraph (p) of the opening paragraph
  of this subdivision. For the  purposes  of  such  application  any  such
  excess shall be allocated among the counties comprising a transportation
  district in the same proportion that their respective recording officers
  paid  over  additional  taxes hereunder during the whole of the calendar
  year which is  the  subject  of  the  certification.  For  the  counties
  comprising  the  city of New York, any such application shall be for the
  benefit of such city.
    2. The balance of all moneys paid to the  recording  officer  of  each
  county  during  each  month upon account of the special additional taxes
  imposed pursuant to subdivision one-a of section two hundred fifty-three
  of this chapter, after deducting the necessary expenses of his office as
  provided in section  two  hundred  sixty-two,  except  taxes  paid  upon
  mortgages  which  under  the provisions of section two hundred sixty are
  first to be apportioned by the tax commission, shall be paid over by him
  on or before the tenth day of each succeeding month to the state of  New
  York  mortgage  agency  created  pursuant  to title seventeen of article
  eight of the public authorities law for deposit to  the  credit  of  the
  mortgage  insurance  fund created pursuant to such title, and (i) except
  that with respect to mortgages recorded on and after May first, nineteen
  hundred eighty-seven, the balance of all moneys  paid  upon  account  of
  such  special  additional  taxes  during  each  month  to  the recording
  officers  of  the  counties   comprising   the   metropolitan   commuter
  transportation  district, as defined by section twelve hundred sixty-two
  of the public  authorities  law,  on  mortgages  of  any  real  property
  principally  improved  or  to  be improved by a structure containing six
  residential dwelling units or less  with  separate  cooking  facilities,
  after  the  deduction  of such expenses, shall be paid over by him on or
  before the tenth day  of  each  succeeding  month  to  the  metropolitan
  transportation  authority  for  deposit  in the corporate transportation


 account of  the  metropolitan  transportation  special  assistance  fund
  established   by   section   twelve  hundred  seventy-a  of  the  public
  authorities law, and (ii) except that with respect to mortgages recorded
  on  and  after  May first, nineteen hundred eighty-seven, the balance of
  all moneys paid upon account of such  special  additional  taxes  during
  each  month to the recording officers of the county of Erie on mortgages
  of any real property  principally  improved  or  to  be  improved  by  a
  structure  containing  six  residential  dwelling  units  or  less  with
  separate cooking facilities, after the deduction of such expenses, shall
  be paid over by him on or before the tenth day of each succeeding  month
  to  the  Niagara  Frontier transportation authority. Notwithstanding the
  provisions of the preceding sentence, the special  additional  taxes  so
  imposed  and  paid upon mortgages covering real property situated in two
  or more counties, which under the  provisions  of  section  two  hundred
  sixty  are  first  to  be apportioned by the commissioner, shall be paid
  over by the recording officer receiving the  same  as  provided  by  the
  determination of said commissioner.
    3.  On  or before the tenth day of each month the recording officer of
  each county shall pay over to the county treasurer of said  county,  and
  in  the  counties  of New York, Kings, Queens, Richmond and Bronx to the
  commissioner of finance of the city  of  New  York  for  credit  to  the
  general fund of such city, the balance of the moneys received during the
  preceding  month  upon  account  of  taxes  paid to him or her as herein
  prescribed, after deducting the necessary expenses of his or her  office
  as  provided  in  section  two hundred sixty-two of this article, except
  taxes paid upon mortgages which under  the  provisions  of  section  two
  hundred  sixty  of  this  article  are  first  to  be apportioned by the
  commissioner,  which  taxes  and  money  shall  be  paid  over  by   the
  commissioner  of  finance  of  the  city  of New York as provided by the
  determination of the commissioner. In each county not within the city of
  New York, the whole of  the  net  amount  of  such  balance,  after  the
  deduction  by  the  county treasurer of the necessary expenses of his or
  her office provided in section two hundred sixty-two  of  this  article,
  shall  be held by him or her and shall be allocated to the tax districts
  of the county according to the location of the real property covered  by
  the respective mortgages upon which the tax was collected. The recording
  officer and county treasurer shall prepare a joint semi-annual report on
  or before May fifteenth and on or before November fifteenth in each year
  showing the amounts to be credited to each tax district of the county of
  the  moneys collected under this article during the preceding periods of
  six months each which  ended  respectively  on  March  thirty-first  and
  September   thirtieth.  Such  report  shall  be  made  in  duplicate  in
  accordance with the rules and regulations of the commissioner and  filed
  with  the  clerk  of  the board of supervisors and the commissioner. The
  board of supervisors, on or before the fifteenth day of June and  on  or
  before  the  fifteenth  day  of  December  in each year, shall issue its
  warrant for the payment to the respective tax districts of  the  amounts
  so  credited,  provided,  however,  that  in  a  county  in which a town
  contains within its limits an incorporated village, or portion  thereof,
  the  board of supervisors shall apportion to such village so much of the
  share credited to the town as the assessed  value  of  said  village  or
  portion thereof bears to twice the total assessed valuation of the town,
  and provided, further, that, at the option of the governing board of the
  county,  the county may instead prepare and file such a joint report and
  make such payments on a monthly or quarterly  basis.  Where  the  county
  elects  to  make  monthly  payments,  the  recording  officer and county
  treasurer shall prepare a joint report on or before the fifteenth day of
  each month showing the amounts to be credited to each  tax  district  of


 the  county  and  the  moneys collected under this article for the month
  preceding  the  most  recently  concluded  month,  and  the   board   of
  supervisors  shall  issue  its  warrant  for  payment  on  or before the
  fifteenth  day  of  the following month. Where the county elects to make
  quarterly payments, the recording officer  and  county  treasurer  shall
  prepare  such  a  joint  report  on  or before the fifteenth day of May,
  August, November, and February, showing the amounts to  be  credited  to
  each  tax  district of the county of moneys collected under this article
  for the preceding three-month period  ending  March  thirty-first,  June
  thirtieth,  September thirtieth, and December thirty-first, respectively
  and the board of supervisors shall issue its warrant for payment  on  or
  before  the  fifteenth  day  of  June,  September,  December, and March,
  respectively. The warrant shall direct payment to the city treasurer  of
  the  amount  due  the city, to the town supervisor of the amount due the
  town, and to the village treasurer of the amount to  which  the  village
  shall  be  entitled.  Mortgage  tax moneys allotted to cities, towns and
  villages shall be  applied  to  the  payment  of  the  general  expenses
  thereof.  The  commissioner shall prescribe the method of adjustment and
  correction of errors heretofore or hereafter made in the distribution of
  moneys collected under this article. Provided, however that in the  town
  of  Ossining,  county  of  Westchester, monies due to the unincorporated
  portion of the town shall be placed  in  the  unincorporated  town  fund
  instead of into the general fund of such town.




   §  262.    Expenses  of  officers.    Recording  officers  and  county
  treasurers shall severally be entitled to receive  all  their  necessary
  expenses  for  the purposes of this article, including printing, hire of
  clerks and assistants, being first  approved  and  allowed  by  the  tax
  commission  and,  after  audit  by the comptroller, shall be retained by
  them out of the moneys coming into their  hands.    In  counties  wholly
  within the city of New York for the purposes of retirement the recording
  officers,  clerks  and  assistants  shall  be  considered as in the city
  service to the same extent as though their salaries  had  actually  been
  paid by the city of New York.




   §  262.    Expenses  of  officers.    Recording  officers  and  county
  treasurers shall severally be entitled to receive  all  their  necessary
  expenses  for  the purposes of this article, including printing, hire of
  clerks and assistants, being first  approved  and  allowed  by  the  tax
  commission  and,  after  audit  by the comptroller, shall be retained by
  them out of the moneys coming into their  hands.    In  counties  wholly
  within the city of New York for the purposes of retirement the recording
  officers,  clerks  and  assistants  shall  be  considered as in the city
  service to the same extent as though their salaries  had  actually  been
  paid by the city of New York.




   §  263.  Supervisory power of commissioner of taxation and finance and
  comptroller.  1. (a) The commissioner of taxation and finance shall have
  general supervisory power over all recording officers in respect of  the
  duties  imposed  by  this  article  and  he  may  make  such  rules  and
  regulations for the government of recording officers in respect  to  the
  matters  provided  for  in  this article as he may deem proper, provided
  that such rules and regulations shall not be inconsistent with  this  or
  any other statute.  Whenever a duly verified application for a refund of
  mortgage  taxes erroneously paid is made to the commissioner of taxation
  and finance or where a discharge has been recorded  in  the  case  of  a
  mortgagor  exercising a statutory right of rescission in accordance with
  section two hundred fifty-seven-a of this article  who  has  filed  such
  application,  it shall be the duty of such commissioner, or the delegate
  duly authorized by him in writing, to determine the amount that has been
  so paid or which is refundable by reason of the exercise of the right of
  rescission and, after audit thereof by the comptroller, to make an order
  directing the appropriate recording officer  to  refund  the  amount  so
  determined,  together  with  interest at the rate of one-half of one per
  centum thereof for each month or fraction of a month for the period from
  the date the application for refund in processible form is  received  by
  the commissioner of taxation and finance to a date preceding the date of
  the  refund  check  by  not  more  than thirty days, except as otherwise
  provided in paragraph (b) of this  subdivision.  Provided,  however,  no
  such  interest  shall  be  allowed or paid if the refund check is issued
  within ninety days of the date  such  application  is  received  and  no
  interest  shall  be  allowed  or paid if the amount of interest would be
  less than one dollar. The amount so ordered to be  paid  shall  be  paid
  from  mortgage  tax  moneys  in such recording officer's hands, or which
  shall come to his hands, to the party entitled to  receive  it  and  the
  recording  officer  shall  charge  such amount back to the state, public
  benefit corporation or tax district, as the case may be, that  may  have
  been  credited  with  the same. No refund of tax paid under this article
  shall be allowed unless the application for refund is filed  within  two
  years from the time the erroneous payment of tax was received or, in the
  case of a refund arising out of the exercise of the right of rescission,
  within  two  years  from the time of payment of tax or one year from the
  date of discharge of the mortgage which is  subject  to  such  exercise,
  whichever  is  later.  If any recording officer shall have collected and
  paid over to the treasurer of any county, or to the state  or  a  public
  benefit  corporation,  a  tax  paid  upon  a  mortgage  which  under the
  provisions of section two  hundred  sixty  of  this  chapter  is  to  be
  apportioned  by  the  commissioner  of  taxation and finance before such
  apportionment has been made, or if any recording officer shall have paid
  over to a county treasurer, the state or a  public  benefit  corporation
  more  money  than  required on account of mortgage taxes, such recording
  officer shall make a report to the commissioner of taxation and  finance
  in the form of a verified statement of facts and said commissioner shall
  determine  the  method  of  adjustment  and,  after audit thereof by the
  comptroller, shall issue his order accordingly.
    (b) In any city of this state having a population of  one  million  or
  more,  the  overpayment  rate  referred  to  in  paragraph  (a)  of this
  subdivision shall be set by the commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance
  pursuant  to  subsection  (e) of section one thousand ninety-six of this
  chapter, or if no rate is set, at the rate of six percent per annum  for
  the  period from the date the application for refund in processible form
  is received by the commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  to  a  date
  preceding the date of the refund check by not more than thirty days.


   2.  The  comptroller  shall  have  general  supervisory power over all
  county treasurers in respect to the duties imposed  upon  them  by  this
  article,  and may make such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with
  this or any other statute, for the government of said county  treasurers
  as  he  deems proper to secure a due accounting for all taxes and moneys
  collected or received and refunds and  interest  paid  pursuant  to  any
  provision of this article.






	   §  264.    Tax  on prior advance mortgages.   Whenever any part of the
  amount of the principal indebtedness which is or under  any  contingency
  may  be  secured  by  a  mortgage recorded prior to July first, nineteen
  hundred and six, is advanced after July first, nineteen hundred and six,
  the tax prescribed by  section  two  hundred  and  fifty-three  of  this
  article  is  hereby  imposed  on the amount of principal indebtedness so
  advanced, which tax shall be payable at the same time and  in  the  same
  manner  as  taxes  imposed by section two hundred and fifty-nine of this
  article, and all the provisions of section two hundred and fifty-nine in
  relation to the time and manner  of  paying  such  tax,  the  filing  of
  statements  in  relation  to  the  time and amount of such advances, and
  penalties for failure to file the same  shall  apply  to  advances  made
  under  this section and the payment of a tax thereon, except that if the
  mortgagor is not a corporation, such statements shall be  filed  by  the
  owner  of  the  mortgage, who, for failure to do so, shall be subject to
  the penalties prescribed by such section.   In case  said  mortgage  was
  given  to secure the payment of a series of bonds, the mortgagor may, at
  the time of paying such tax, present to the recording officer, the bonds
  representing the portion of the principal indebtedness secured  by  said
  mortgage  upon  which  the  tax  is  to be paid, and also file with said
  recording officer a statement verified by the mortgagor or an officer or
  duly authorized agent or attorney of the mortgagor specifying that  said
  bonds,  so  presented,  are  the  bonds representing that portion of the
  principal indebtedness secured by said mortgage upon which the tax is to
  be paid and that said bonds are secured by a mortgage recorded  in  said
  office  stating  the date of said mortgage and the liber and page of the
  record of the same.  It shall be the duty of such recording  officer  to
  indorse upon each of said bonds, so presented to him, a statement signed
  by  him  to  the  effect  that  the  tax imposed by this article on that
  portion  of  the  principal  indebtedness  secured  by   said   mortgage
  represented  by  said  bonds  has been paid, and said statement shall be
  conclusive  proof  of  such  payment.    Notwithstanding  the  exception
  contained in section two hundred and fifty-four, the record owner of any
  mortgage  recorded  prior to July first, nineteen hundred and six, other
  than a corporate trust mortgage, may file in the office of the recording
  officer where such mortgage is first recorded a statement  in  form  and
  substance  as  required  by  section  two hundred and fifty-four of this
  article, except that it shall  specify  and  state  the  amount  of  all
  advancements made thereon prior to said date, giving the date and amount
  of  each advancement and the amount of such prior advancements remaining
  unpaid, and thereby elect that the same be taxed under this article; and
  any mortgagor or mortgagee under a corporate  trust  mortgage  given  to
  secure  a series of bonds or the owner of any such bond or bonds secured
  thereby may file in the office  of  the  recording  officer  where  such
  mortgage is first recorded a statement in form and substance as required
  by  section  two  hundred and fifty-four of this article, except that it
  shall specify the serial number, the date and amount of  each  bond  and
  otherwise sufficiently describe the same to identify it as being secured
  by  such  mortgage,  and  thereby elect that such bond or bonds be taxed
  under this article, and such bond or bonds shall be taxed upon the whole
  amount thereof notwithstanding the provisions of section two hundred and
  sixty of this article.  A tax shall thereupon, in the case of  mortgages
  other  than corporate trust mortgages, be computed, levied and collected
  upon the amount of the principal debt or obligation represented by  said
  unpaid  prior  advancements at the time of filing such statement, or, in
  the case of a corporate trust mortgage, upon the amount of the  bond  or
  bonds  specified  in  the  statement  filed,  at  the rate prescribed by
  section two hundred  and  fifty-three  of  this  article.    Said  bonds


 representing  prior  advancements  under  corporate  trust mortgages and
  taxed as herein provided may be  presented  to  the  recording  officer,
  whose  duty  it  is  to  collect  said tax, for indorsement and he shall
  thereupon  indorse  upon each of said bonds a statement, attested by his
  signature, of the payment of the tax as  provided  in  this  section  in
  respect  to  bonds  representing subsequent advancements, and the record
  owner of any other mortgage taxed  upon  prior  advancements  as  herein
  provided  may  present  said  mortgage  to  the  recording  officer  and
  thereupon such officer shall note  upon  the  same  the  filing  of  the
  statement and the amount of the tax paid, attested by his signature.  In
  all  such  cases  the  recording officer shall note on the margin of the
  record of such mortgage the filing of such statement and the  amount  of
  the  tax  paid,  and,  in  case  of  bonds  secured  by  corporate trust
  mortgages, the serial number of each such bond.   The words  "bond"  and
  "bonds"  as used in this section shall be deemed to embrace all notes or
  other evidences of indebtedness secured by mortgages taxable under  this
  section.    In  case  of  any  mortgage  taxable under this section, the
  portion of the indebtedness secured thereby upon which the  tax  imposed
  by  this  section  is  paid, and such portion only, shall be exempt from
  taxation under the provisions of section two hundred  and  fifty-one  of
  this  article.    Whenever  the  tax  imposed by section two hundred and
  sixty-four of  this  article  as  said  section  existed  prior  to  May
  thirteenth,  nineteen  hundred  and seven, has been paid with respect to
  any mortgage, no additional tax shall accrue on such mortgage under this
  section as hereby enacted and such mortgage and the debt  or  obligation
  secured  thereby,  shall  continue  to be entitled to the exemptions and
  immunities conferred by this article and all of the provisions  of  this
  article  shall remain applicable to such mortgage.  All taxes imposed by
  or which became due, payable or collectible on or before  the  thirtieth
  day of June, nineteen hundred and six, pursuant to chapter seven hundred
  and  twenty-nine of the laws of nineteen hundred and five, and all taxes
  which under section two hundred and fifty-eight of this  chapter  became
  due  and payable on the thirtieth day of July, nineteen hundred and six,
  and all other taxes, if any, which were imposed by chapter seven hundred
  and twenty-nine of the laws of nineteen hundred and five on any mortgage
  recorded prior to the first day of July, nineteen hundred  and  six,  in
  respect  to  any  period  ending  on  or  before  the first day of July,
  nineteen hundred  and six, shall be imposed, become due, be payable  and
  collectible  and  shall be paid over and distributed in the same manner,
  and with the same force and effect as  if  this  article  had  not  been
  enacted;  and  for  the purpose of collecting, paying over, distributing
  and enforcing any such taxes, chapter seven hundred and  twenty-nine  of
  the  laws  of  nineteen hundred and five shall be deemed to be in force,
  and the lien for such taxes shall attach and such taxes shall be  levied
  and  collected  as  provided in chapter seven hundred and twenty-nine of
  the laws of nineteen hundred and five, anything herein contained to  the
  contrary notwithstanding.




   § 265.  Tax a lien; exceptions.  The tax in this article imposed shall
  be  deemed  and  is  hereby declared to be a lien upon the mortgage upon
  which such tax is imposed  and  upon  the  debt  or  obligation  secured
  thereby,  except  that  upon  mortgages  recorded  prior  to July first,
  nineteen hundred six, such  lien  shall  extend  only  to  that  portion
  thereof represented by the amount advanced subsequently to such date and
  to  the  debt  or  obligation  secured  by such advancement, and for the
  purpose of enforcing the payment of the tax  in  this  article  imposed,
  such  mortgage  and  the  debt  thereby  secured  shall  be deemed to be
  property within this state notwithstanding that  such  mortgage  may  be
  owned  by or be in the possession of a person or corporation outside the
  state and a copy thereof duly certified by the recording officer of  any
  county  in  which  such  mortgage  is recorded shall, for the purpose of
  enforcing the payment of such tax, be deemed to be, and shall  have  the
  same  force  and  effect  as  the  original  mortgage and may be sold to
  satisfy such tax and upon a sale of the whole or any part thereof, shall
  carry with it and transfer to the purchaser all  the  rights,  interests
  and  obligations  of  the  mortgagee  therein  named  or his assignee or
  successor in interest in and to  such  mortgage  and  the  debt  secured
  thereby,  or the part thereof to which such lien attaches, together with
  interest and costs.  The lien of the tax resulting from a deed of  trust
  or  a  deed  absolute  on  its  face  which  is  security  for a debt or
  obligation shall cease ten years after the recording  thereof,  provided
  such a mortgage is in the hands of a bona fide purchaser for value.




   § 266. Enforcement; procedure. In case the tax imposed by this article
  is  not  paid as in this article provided, the tax commission may notify
  the attorney-general of such failure or refusal to pay and it shall then
  be the duty of the attorney-general to enforce the payment of such  tax,
  and for that purpose he may maintain an action in the name of the people
  of the state of New York, in any court of competent jurisdiction, either
  to  sell  such  mortgage;  or,  he  may  maintain  an action against the
  mortgagee or his assignee  or  successor  in  interest  personally;  or,
  whereby  stipulations  contained in such mortgage it is made the duty of
  the mortgagor to pay such tax, or where the mortgagor is liable for  the
  tax  imposed  under  this  article,  then  against  the mortgagor or his
  successor in interest personally; or, in the case of  a  trust  mortgage
  against  the  trust mortgagee, personally; or, he may pursue either, any
  or all such remedies. All actions instituted by the attorney-general, as
  herein provided, shall, if the amount involved is fifty dollars or more,
  be brought in the county of Albany. Where, in any action, a recovery  is
  had  there  shall be added to the amount of such tax and included in the
  judgment, interest at the rate of one per centum per month on the amount
  of such tax, to be computed from the date on which such tax  became  due
  and  payable,  except  that  in the case of taxable mortgages heretofore
  recorded and upon which the tax imposed by this  article  has  not  been
  paid,  and  where, in such case, no penalty is prescribed by law for the
  nonpayment of such tax, interest shall be added at the rate of  six  per
  centum  per  annum.  In any action brought as herein provided, where the
  judgment provides for the sale of the mortgage, such judgment shall also
  prescribe the time, place and manner of such  sale  and  of  the  notice
  thereof  to  be  given,  and, in the discretion of the court, may direct
  that such sale be made by or under the direction of the  comptroller  or
  the  recording  officer  of  the county in which such mortgage was first
  recorded, and all money recovered in such action shall be  paid  by  the
  attorney-general to the proper recording officer in satisfaction of such
  tax,  and  all  costs  recovered  therein  shall  be paid into the state
  treasury.
    Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see article  thirty-seven  of
  this chapter.




   § 267. Idem.; where recovery is had against trust mortgagee.--In every
  case  where  recovery  is  had  personally  against a trust mortgagee as
  herein provided, and payment of the amount recovered has  been  made  by
  such trust mortgagee, or where such trust mortgagee has voluntarily paid
  such  tax,  he  shall  be  deemed to have and possess and to have become
  subrogated to all the rights and  interests  in  and  to  the  tax  lien
  imposed  by  section  two hundred and sixty-five hereof, and may enforce
  the repayment of any such sum so paid by him with interest at  the  rate
  of  six per centum per annum and for that purpose may maintain an action
  in his own name in any court in the state having  jurisdiction,  against
  any  person,  association  or corporation liable to pay such tax, or for
  the sale of such mortgage and the debt secured  thereby  to  which  such
  lien attaches.




   §  270.    Amount  of  tax.    1.    There is hereby imposed and shall
  immediately accrue and be collected a tax, as herein  provided,  on  all
  sales,  or  agreements to sell, or memoranda of sales and all deliveries
  or transfers of shares or certificates  of  stock,  or  certificates  of
  rights   to   stock,   or   certificates  of  interest  in  property  or
  accumulations, or  certificates  of  deposit  representing  certificates
  taxable  under  this  article,  in  any domestic or foreign association,
  company  or  corporation,  or  certificates  of  interest  in   business
  conducted  by  a  trustee or trustees, made after the first day of June,
  nineteen hundred five, whether made upon or shown by the  books  of  the
  association,  company,  corporation, or trustee, or by any assignment in
  blank, or by any delivery, or by any paper or agreement or memorandum or
  other evidence of sale or transfer, whether intermediate or  final,  and
  whether  investing  the  holder with the beneficial interest in or legal
  title to said stock, or other certificates taxable hereunder, or  merely
  with  the  possession  or  use thereof for any purpose, or to secure the
  future payment of money, or the future transfer of any  such  stock,  or
  certificates.    The  purchase, redemption or other reacquisition of its
  own shares by a corporation is subject to tax under this article  unless
  such shares are cancelled on reacquisition pursuant to the provisions of
  section  five hundred fifteen of the business corporation law, or unless
  within one year of the  date  of  such  purchase,  redemption  or  other
  reacquisition,  such shares are cancelled by an appropriate amendment to
  the corporation's certificate of incorporation or by action of the board
  of directors of such corporation.
    2.  Except as otherwise provided by section two hundred  seventy-a  of
  this  chapter, the tax imposed by this section shall be two and one-half
  cents for each share, except in cases where the shares  or  certificates
  are  sold,  in  which  cases  the  tax  shall  be at the rate of one and
  one-quarter cents for each share where the selling price  is  less  than
  five  dollars per share; two and one-half cents for each share where the
  selling price is five dollars or  more  per  share  and  less  than  ten
  dollars  per  share; three and three-quarters cents for each share where
  the selling price is ten dollars or more per share and less than  twenty
  dollars  per share and five cents for each share where the selling price
  is twenty dollars or more per share.
    3.   It shall  be  the  duty  of  the  person  or  persons  making  or
  effectuating  the  sale  or transfer, including the person or persons to
  whom the sale or transfer is made, to  pay  the  tax  provided  by  this
  article; provided, however, that this subdivision shall not apply to any
  sale  or  transfer  wherein  the  vendor or transferor is a governmental
  entity or international organization which is not subject to the tax.
    4.  The payment of such tax shall be denoted by an adhesive  stamp  or
  stamps affixed as follows:  In the case of a sale or transfer, where the
  evidence  of  the  transaction  is  shown  only  by  the  books  of  the
  association, company, corporation or trustee, the stamp shall be  placed
  upon  such  books,  and  it  shall  be  the duty of the person making or
  effectuating such sale  or  transfer  to  procure  and  furnish  to  the
  association,  company,  corporation or trustee the requisite stamps, and
  of such association, company, corporation or trustee to affix and cancel
  the same.  Where the transaction is effected by the delivery or transfer
  of a certificate,  the  stamp  shall  be  placed  upon  the  surrendered
  certificate and canceled; and in cases of an agreement to sell, or where
  the  sale  is effected by delivery of the certificate assigned in blank,
  there shall be made and delivered by the seller to the buyer, a bill  or
  memorandum  of such sale to which the stamp provided for by this article
  shall be affixed and canceled.  Every such bill or memorandum of sale or
  agreement to sell shall show  the  date  of  the  transaction  which  it


 evidences,  the  name of the seller, the stock, or other certificate, to
  which it relates, and the number of shares thereof.  All such  bills  or
  memoranda  of sale shall bear a number upon the face thereof and no more
  than one such bill or memorandum of sale made by the seller on any given
  day  shall bear the same number.  The aforesaid identification number of
  the bill or memorandum of  sale  shall  in  all  cases  be  entered  and
  recorded  in  the  book  of  account  required to be kept by section two
  hundred seventy-six of this  chapter;  and  no  further  tax  is  hereby
  imposed  upon  the delivery of the certificate, or upon the actual issue
  of a new certificate when the original certificate is accompanied by the
  duly stamped memorandum of sale as herein provided.
    5.  The tax imposed by this section shall not apply to the  following,
  provided  the  transaction  in each case is accompanied by a certificate
  setting forth the facts or such other certificate or record as  the  tax
  commission may require:
    (a)    A  sale,  agreement to sell, memorandum of sale, or delivery or
  transfer of shares or certificates of stock or any certificates  taxable
  under this section, made on an organized securities exchange within this
  state  registered  with  the  securities  and exchange commission of the
  United States, of less than one hundred shares and less than the unit of
  trading on such exchange, by any person, firm, company,  association  or
  corporation  registered  with  such  exchange,  and  engaged thereon, as
  dealer in less than the unit of trading;
    (b)  An agreement evidencing the deposit of certificates as collateral
  security, which certificates are not actually sold, or such certificates
  so deposited, or transfers of such certificates to the person with  whom
  they are deposited as collateral security or to a nominee of such person
  or  from  one  nominee  of  such  person  to  another, provided the same
  continue to be held by such person or nominee or nominees as  collateral
  security  as  aforesaid,  or  the retransfer of such certificates to the
  depositor;
    (c)  Transfers or deliveries of certificates pursuant to  a  statutory
  provision,  to  a trustee or public officer to secure the performance of
  obligations, or retransfers or redeliveries of such certificates to  the
  transferer or depositor;
    (d)    Transfers  of  certificates  from  the name of a fiduciary to a
  nominee of such fiduciary, or from one  nominee  of  such  fiduciary  to
  another,  provided  the  same  continue  to  be  held by such nominee or
  nominees for the same purpose for which they would be held  if  retained
  by such fiduciary, or from the nominee to such fiduciary;
    (e)  Transfers of certificates from the name of the owner thereof to a
  custodian  where  the certificates are to be held or disposed of by such
  custodian for and subject to the instructions of the owner, or from  the
  name  of  such  custodian  to  the  owner  by whom the certificates were
  transferred to such custodian, or from the name of such custodian  to  a
  nominee  of  such  custodian,  or  from one nominee of such custodian to
  another, provided the same continue  to  be  held  by  such  nominee  or
  nominees  for  the same purpose for which they would be held if retained
  by such custodian, or from the nominee to such custodian;
    (f)  Mere loans of stock or certificates, or the return thereof;
    (g)  Deliveries or transfers from the name of the owner  to  a  broker
  for  sale,  or deliveries by or transfers from the name of a broker to a

    (h)   Deliveries  or  transfers  of  shares  or  certificates  from  a
  corporation to its registered nominee, or from one registered nominee of
  such  corporation  to  another  such  nominee,  provided  the  shares or
  certificates continue to be held by such nominee for  the  same  purpose


 for  which  they  would be held if retained by such corporation, or from
  such nominee to such corporation.
    (i)    Transfers  or  deliveries  of  shares  or certificates upon the
  instructions of a broker,  whether  doing  business  as  a  corporation,
  partnership  or  individually,  from  his  name  or from the name of his
  customer to such broker's registered nominee for the purpose of  holding
  such  shares  or  certificates subject to the instructions of a clearing
  corporation affiliated with any securities exchange in  this  state,  as
  agent for such broker, and transfers or deliveries upon the instructions
  of  such  clearing corporation from the name of such broker's registered
  nominee to such broker or customer.  For the purposes of this paragraph,
  the term "broker" shall include any banking corporation or trust company
  incorporated under the laws of this  or  another  state  of  the  United
  States and any bank organized under the laws of the United States.
    (j)    Transfers  or  deliveries  of  shares  or certificates upon the
  instructions of a depositor in a system  for  the  central  handling  of
  securities   (including   the   clearing   and  settling  of  securities
  transactions) (a) established  by  a  national  securities  exchange  or
  association  registered  with  the securities and exchange commission of
  the United States or (b) maintained by a clearing corporation as defined
  in section 8--102 of the uniform commercial code, from the name of  such
  depositor or his nominee or from the name of his customer or the nominee
  of  such  customer  to the registered nominee of any such system for the
  purpose of holding such  shares  or  certificates,  as  agent  for  such
  depositor, and transfers or deliveries upon the instructions of any such
  depositor from the name of the registered nominee of such system to same
  depositor,  customer  or nominee.  For the purposes of this paragraph, a
  "depositor" shall include such  securities  exchanges  or  associations,
  registered  under  a statute of the United States such as the Securities
  Exchange  Act  of  1934  as  amended,  and  their  affiliated   clearing
  corporations,   such   banks,  trust  companies,  investment  companies,
  insurance companies and other financial organizations as are subject  to
  supervision or regulation pursuant to the provisions of federal or state
  banking  laws  or  state  insurance  laws  and such brokers, dealers and
  investment companies as are registered under the Securities Exchange Act
  of 1934 as amended, or the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended, if
  the foregoing individuals or organizations have been  accepted  by  such
  system for the central handling of securities as participants therein.
    (k)    Transfers  or  deliveries  of  shares  or certificates upon the
  instructions of a depositor in a system  for  the  central  handling  of
  securities  as  described  in paragraph (j) of this subdivision from the

  another  such  system,  provided  the  same  continue  to be held by the
  nominee of such other system for the same purpose as previously held for
  such depositor by the nominee of such other system.
    (l)  Where the sale, agreement of sale, memorandum of  sale,  delivery
  or  transfer  of  a  security  is effected   in a manner which would not
  otherwise subject such transaction to a tax, the  tax  shall  not  apply
  solely by reason of the receipt or payment of cash in this state as part
  of  a  system  for  the  central  handling  of  securities  described in
  paragraph (j) of this  subdivision  or  the  making  of  an  accounting,
  bookkeeping or similar entry in records maintained in this state as part
  of such system. The tax commission shall prescribe rules and regulations
  to effectuate the purposes of this paragraph and paragraphs (i), (j) and
  (k) of this subdivision, and shall have all the rights and powers as set
  forth  in section two hundred seventy-six of this chapter to examine any
  transactions or records of any nature of such system.


   6.  The tax imposed by this section  shall  not  apply  to  shares  or
  certificates   of   stock,  or  certificates  of  rights  to  stock,  or
  certificates of deposit representing certificates of the character taxed
  by this article, in any domestic association,  company  or  corporation,
  even  though  a record of the transfer is made in the stock book kept in
  compliance with section  ten  of  the  stock  corporation  law,  if  the
  transfer  is  made  upon  the  books  of  such  association,  company or
  corporation regularly kept at a transfer office or by a  transfer  agent
  outside  the state, provided the keeping of such books outside the state
  is necessary or convenient for the transaction of the ordinary  business
  affairs  of  such association, company or corporation and is approved by
  the tax commission, and neither the sale, nor the agreement to sell, nor
  the memorandum of sale, nor the delivery is made in this  state  and  no
  act  necessary to effect the transfer (other than the making of a record
  in the stock book kept in compliance  with  section  ten  of  the  stock
  corporation law) is done in this state.
    7.    As used in this section, the term "registered nominee" means any
  person registered with the tax commission in accordance with such  rules
  and regulations as it shall prescribe.
    8.    Nothing in this section contained shall be construed to impose a
  tax upon sales, agreements to sell, memoranda of  sales,  deliveries  or
  transfers of shares or certificates
    (a)    issued  under  a noncorporate investment trust agreement of the
  fixed type and no such sale, agreement  to  sell,  memorandum  of  sale,
  delivery  or  transfer shall result in imposing a tax under this section
  on the securities held in such an investment trust; or
    (b)   of an investment trust  between  the  investment  trust  and  an
  underwriter,  between  an  underwriter  and  a  dealer  in securities or
  between an underwriter or dealer and an  investor.    As  used  in  this
  paragraph,  the term "investment trust" means an investment trust of the
  management type, the shareholders of which are, upon reasonable  notice,
  entitled  to  require the investment trust to redeem or repurchase their
  shares or certificates for their proportionate interest in the  property
  of the investment trust, or the cash equivalent thereof, less a discount
  of  not  more  than three per centum thereof, and the term "underwriter"
  means a person, firm or corporation who has entered  into  an  agreement
  with such investment trust to effectuate, alone or through others, sales
  of shares or certificates of the investment trust.




   §  270-b.  Exemption of certain transfers to legatees and others.  The
  tax imposed by sections two hundred seventy and two hundred seventy-a of
  this chapter shall not be imposed upon any deliveries or transfers by an
  executor or administrator to a legatee, heir or distributee of shares or
  certificates of stock if it is shown to  the  satisfaction  of  the  tax
  commission  that the value of such shares or certificates is not greater
  than the amount of the tax that  would  otherwise  be  imposed  on  such
  delivery or transfer.




   § 270-c.  Transfers  by  operation  of  law;  special  exemptions.  No
  transaction taxable under sections two hundred seventy and  two  hundred
  seventy-a  of this chapter shall be exempt because effected by operation
  of law. The tax imposed by sections two hundred seventy and two  hundred
  seventy-a  of  this  chapter  shall  not be imposed upon any delivery or
  transfer:
    1. From a decedent to his executor or administrator;
    2. From a minor to his guardian or from a guardian to  his  ward  upon

  such officer or commission or by a court, in  the  taking  over  of  its
  assets,  in  whole  or in part, under state or federal law regulating or
  supervising such institutions, nor upon redelivery or retransfer by  any
  such transferee or successor thereto;
    6.  From a bankrupt or person in receivership due to insolvency to the
  trustee in bankruptcy or receiver, from such receiver to such trustee or
  from such trustee to such receiver, nor upon redelivery or retransfer by
  any such transferee or successor thereto;
    7. From a transferee under paragraphs one to six,  inclusive,  to  his
  successor  acting  in  the  same capacity, or from one such successor to
  another;
    8. From a foreign country or national thereof to the United States  or
  any agency thereof, or to the government of any foreign country directed
  pursuant  to  the authority vested in the president of the United States
  by section five (b) of the trading with the enemy act (40 Stat. 415), as
  amended by the first war powers act (55 Stat. 838);
    9. From trustees to surviving, substitute,  succeeding  or  additional

  necessary  or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of section eleven
  (b) of the Public  Utility  Holding  Company  Act  of  Nineteen  Hundred
  Thirty-five  and specifies and itemizes the securities which are ordered

  consist of said capital stock immediately after such exchange.
    The  tax commission may require that each such delivery or transfer be
  accompanied by a certificate setting forth the facts.




   §  270-d.    Tax  surcharge.    1.   In addition to the tax imposed by
  subdivision one of section two hundred seventy of this article, there is
  hereby imposed and shall immediately accrue  and  be  collected  a  like
  additional  tax on all sales, agreements to sell, memoranda of sales and
  all deliveries or transfers of shares or  certificates  subject  to  tax
  under  such  subdivision  during  the period commencing on August first,
  nineteen hundred seventy-five and  ending  July  thirty-first,  nineteen
  hundred   seventy-eight.    Such  additional  tax  is  at  the  rate  of
  twenty-five per cent of the rates of tax on  sales  or  transfers  under
  subdivision  two  of  section  two  hundred  seventy  and on sales under
  subdivision one of section two hundred seventy-a and the maximum  amount
  of  tax  on a single qualifying sale under section two hundred seventy-e
  of this article.  Provided, however, that the tax  so  calculated  shall
  not  be  carried out in its computation beyond four decimal points, that
  is, it shall be computed to the nearest one one-hundredth of one cent.
    2.  All the provisions of this article shall apply with respect to the
  additional tax imposed by this section to the same extent as if it  were
  imposed  by subdivision one of section two hundred seventy and expressly
  increased the rates of tax under subdivision two of section two  hundred
  seventy  and  subdivision  one  of section two hundred seventy-a and the
  maximum amount of tax on a single taxable sale under subdivision two  of
  section two hundred seventy-a and the term "tax" as used in this article
  shall include the tax imposed by this section as well as the tax imposed
  by  subdivision  one  of  section two hundred seventy and a reference to
  such tax, subdivision one of section two hundred seventy or section  two
  hundred   seventy  shall  include  the  tax  imposed  by  this  section,
  subdivision one of this section and this section, respectively.






	   §  270-e.  Maximum amounts of tax.  1.  Notwithstanding the provisions
  of section two hundred seventy of this chapter,  where  any  transaction
  subject to the tax imposed by this article involves a sale which relates
  to  shares  or  certificates  of  the  same class and issued by the same
  issuer, the amount of tax upon any such transaction which involves  such
  single  qualifying  sale shall not exceed the sum of three hundred fifty
  dollars, provided, however, that such transactions  involving  sales  by
  any  member of a securities exchange or by any registered dealer, who is
  permitted or required pursuant to any rules and regulations  promulgated
  by  the tax commission pursuant to the provisions of section two hundred
  eighty-one-a of this chapter to pay the taxes imposed  by  this  article
  without  the  use  of the stamps prescribed by this article, pursuant to
  one or more orders to sell such shares or certificates placed  with  the
  same  member  of  a securities exchange or the same registered dealer on
  one day, by the same person, each relating to shares or certificates  of
  the  same  class  and  issued by the same issuer, all of which sales are
  executed on the same day (regardless of whether it be  the  day  of  the
  placing  of  the  orders  to  sell),  shall,  for  the  purposes of this
  subdivision one, be considered to constitute a single qualifying sale.
    2.  All the provisions of this article shall apply with respect to the
  maximum amounts of tax provided for by this section to the  same  extent
  and  in  the  same  manner  and with the same force and effect as if the
  language of such provisions had been  incorporated  in  full  into  this
  section  and  had  expressly  referred  to  the  maximum  amounts of tax
  provided for under this section, except to  the  extent  that  any  such
  provision  is either inconsistent with a provision of this section or is
  not relevant to this section.  Provided, further, any reference in  this
  article  to  the  maximum  amounts of tax on a single taxable sale under
  subdivision two of section two hundred seventy-a of this  article  shall
  mean the maximum amounts of tax on a single qualifying sale provided for
  by  this section.   The term "tax" as used in this article shall include
  the maximum amounts of tax provided for by this section as well  as  the
  taxes  imposed  by  subdivisions one of sections two hundred seventy and
  two hundred seventy-d of this article, and  a  reference  to  such  tax,
  subdivision  one  of  section  two hundred seventy or subdivision two of
  section two hundred seventy-a shall include the maximum amounts  of  tax
  provided for by this section or this subdivision, as the case may be.




   § 271.  Stamps, how prepared and sold. Adhesive stamps for the purpose
  of paying the state tax provided for by this article shall  be  prepared
  by  the  tax  commission, in such form, and of such denominations and in
  such quantities as it may from time to time prescribe, and it shall make
  provision for the sale of such stamps by its duly  authorized  agent  or
  agents  in  such  places  and  at  such  times as in its judgment may be
  necessary.
    The tax commission may from time to time and  as  often  as  it  deems
  advisable  provide for the issuance and exclusive use of stamps of a new
  design and forbid the use of stamps of any other  design.  In  order  to
  effect  such  a  change and to discontinue the use of stamps of a former
  design the tax commission shall publish or cause to be published once in
  each week for each of three months immediately preceding  the  time  for
  taking  effect of such change, in one or more daily newspapers published
  in each of the first and second class cities of the state, a  notice  to
  the  effect  that  after  a  certain  day, which shall be at least three
  months after the first publication of said notice, none other  than  the
  new  issue  or  design  of  stamps  shall  be accepted or made use of in
  payment of the tax provided for by this  article.  After  such  date  it
  shall  be  unlawful for any person to make use of any other than the new
  issue or design of stamps in payment of such tax. Any  person  violating
  any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
    Any  person  lawfully  in  possession  of  unused  stamps of an old or
  superseded issue or design may, within ninety days from  the  time  when
  such  change  becomes  effective as aforesaid, surrender the same to the
  tax commission together with a sworn statement setting  forth  the  name
  and  address  of the owner and party surrendering said stamps, how, when
  and  from  whom  the  same  were  acquired  and  such  other   pertinent
  information  as  the  tax  commission  may  require;  whereupon  the tax
  commission shall redeem such unused and surrendered stamps by exchanging
  therefor stamps of a like denomination  of  the  new  issue  or  design.
  Failure  or  refusal of the tax commission to redeem the same by such an
  exchange may be enforced by mandamus.




   § 271-a.  Sale  of  stamps.  No  person, firm, company, association or
  corporation other than a corporation organized under the banking law  of
  this  state  or  under  the national bank act of the United States, or a
  duly authorized agent of the tax commission, shall sell  or  expose  for
  sale, traffic in, trade, barter or exchange any stamp issued pursuant to
  this  article,  without  first  obtaining  from  the  tax commission its
  written consent to sell, traffic in,  trade,  barter  or  exchange  such
  stamps,  except  that  in connection with a sale of or agreement to sell
  stock a broker or agent of the principal making such sale  or  agreement
  to  sell  may  supply  and  affix  the  stamp or stamps required by this
  article. No persons shall sell or expose for sale any stamp so purchased
  or acquired for a sum less than  the  face  value  thereof  without  the
  written consent of the tax commission. Any person lawfully in possession
  of  unused  stamps  of  the  issue  then  in  effect may request the tax
  commission for its consent to redeem the same. He shall present  to  the
  tax commission, if so required, a sworn statement setting forth the name
  and  address  of the owner and the party desiring to redeem said stamps,
  how, when and from whom the same were acquired and such other  pertinent
  and  relevant  information  as the tax commission may require. Thereupon
  the tax commission may authorize the redemption of such  stamps  through
  its  fiscal  agent appointed for the sale of stock transfer stamps. Upon
  the failure or refusal of the tax commission to give such authority  the
  same  may  be  enforced  by  mandamus.  Any  person violating any of the
  provisions of this section shall be guilty of a  misdemeanor,  and  upon
  conviction  thereof  shall be punishable by a fine of not less than five
  hundred nor more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment  for  not
  more  than  six  months,  or  by both such fine and imprisonment, in the
  discretion of the court.




   § 272.  Penalty  for failure to pay tax; liability for tax of agent or
  broker. 1. Except as provided in subdivision three of this section,  any
  person or persons liable to pay the tax by this article imposed, and any
  one  who  acts  in  the  matter  as  agent  or broker for such person or
  persons, who shall make any sale, transfer  or  delivery  of  shares  or
  certificates  taxable  under this article without paying the tax by this
  article imposed, and any person who shall  in  pursuance  of  any  sale,
  transfer  or  agreement, deliver any certificate or evidence of the sale
  or transfer of or agreement to sell any such  certificate,  or  bill  or
  memorandum  thereof,  or  who  shall  transfer  or  cause the same to be
  transferred upon the books  or  records  of  the  association,  company,
  corporation,  or  business  conducted  by a trustee or trustees, and any
  association, company, corporation or business conducted by a trustee  or
  trustees, whose stock or other certificates taxable hereunder is sold or
  transferred,  which  shall  transfer or cause the same to be transferred
  upon its books, without having affixed thereto the stamps  provided  for
  in this article, and where required by the provisions of this article, a
  declaration as prescribed by paragraph (c) of subdivision one of section
  two  hundred  seventy-a  of  this  article  shall  be deemed guilty of a
  misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall pay a fine  of  not  less
  than  five  hundred nor more than one thousand dollars, or be imprisoned
  for not more than six months or by both such fine and  imprisonment,  in
  the discretion of the court.
    2.  Any  person who acts as agent or broker for a person liable to pay
  the tax by this article imposed, who shall be subject to or  liable  for
  the  penalty  provided  for  by  subdivision  one of this section shall,
  regardless of whether he has been prosecuted for or  acquitted  of  such
  criminal  liability,  in  addition to such criminal liability, be liable
  for the payment of the tax, and such liability may be  enforced  in  the
  same  manner  as  any liability for tax imposed by this article, and its
  determination and collection shall be effected pursuant to  and  subject
  to  the  provisions  of sections two hundred seventy-nine-a, two hundred
  seventy-nine-b and two hundred eighty-one of this chapter.  The  burden,
  in any hearing held pursuant to such section two hundred seventy-nine-a,
  of  proving  the  facts  to  show  the  absence of liability for the tax
  imposed by this subdivision upon such agent or  broker,  shall  be  upon
  such agent or broker.
    3. The penalties provided by subdivision one of this section shall not
  apply  to  any  agent or broker or to any other person who shall perform
  any of the acts set  forth  in  such  subdivision,  in  good  faith,  in
  reliance  upon  a  declaration  furnished  pursuant  to paragraph (c) of
  subdivision one of section two hundred seventy-a of this chapter, as  to
  which  declaration  such  broker, agent or other person, before such act
  had received no notice of cancellation of such declaration  pursuant  to
  the provisions of clause (iii) of subparagraph (2) of such paragraph and
  has  no  knowledge  or  reasonable grounds to believe that the status of
  such nonresident as a nonresident has changed.




   § 273.  Canceling  stamps; penalty for failure. In every case where an
  adhesive stamp shall be used to denote the payment of the  tax  provided
  by  this  article,  the person using or affixing the same shall write or
  stamp thereupon the initials of his name and the  date  upon  which  the
  same  shall be attached or used, and shall cut or perforate the stamp in
  a substantial manner, so that such stamp cannot be again  used;  and  if
  any  person  makes use of an adhesive stamp to denote the payment of the
  tax imposed by this article, without so effectually canceling the  same,
  such person shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction
  thereof shall pay a fine of not less than two hundred nor more than five
  hundred  dollars or be imprisoned for not less than six months, or both,
  in the discretion of the court.




   § 274.  Contracts  for dies; expenses, how paid. The tax commission is
  hereby directed to make, enter into and execute for and in behalf of the
  state such contract or contracts for dies, plates and printing necessary
  for the manufacture of the stamps provided  for  by  this  article,  and
  provide  such  stationery  and  clerk  hire together with such books and
  blanks as in its discretion may be necessary for putting into  operation
  the  provisions  of  this  article;  the  tax  commission  shall  be the
  custodian of all  stamps,  dies,  plates  or  other  material  or  thing
  furnished  by  it  and used in the manufacture of such state tax stamps,
  and all expenses incurred by it and under its direction in carrying  out
  the  provisions  of  this  article  shall  be  paid  to  it by the state
  treasurer from any moneys appropriated for such purpose.




   § 275.  Illegal use of stamps; penalty. Any person who shall willfully
  remove or alter or  knowingly  permit  to  be  removed  or  altered  the
  canceling  or  defacing  marks of any stamp provided for by this article
  with intent to use such stamp, or who shall knowingly or willfully  buy,
  prepare  for  use,  use, have in his possession or suffer to be used any
  washed,  restored  or  counterfeit  stamp,  and  any  person  who  shall
  intentionally  remove  or  cause to be removed or knowingly permit to be
  removed any stamp, affixed pursuant to the requirements of this article,
  shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and  on  conviction  thereof  shall  be
  liable  to  a  fine  of  not  less  than  five hundred nor more than one
  thousand dollars, or be imprisoned for not more than  one  year,  or  by
  both such fine and imprisonment, at the discretion of the court.




   § 275-a.  Registration;  penalty  for  failure.  Every  person  acting
  individually or as a trustee, firm, company, association or  corporation
  engaged  in  whole  or  in  part  in the making or negotiating of sales,
  agreements to sell, deliveries or transfers of  shares  or  certificates
  taxable  under  this  article,  or  conducting  or  transacting  a stock
  brokerage business, and every corporation, stock association, company or
  trustee which shall maintain a principal office  or  place  of  business

  state of New York a place for the sale,  transfer  or  delivery  of  its
  stock,  or other certificates included within this article, shall within
  ten days after the amendment to this section shall take effect if such a
  certificate shall  not  have  been  theretofore  filed  with  the  state
  comptroller, or within ten days after engaging in such business or after
  establishing  such  principal office or place of business, or such place
  for the sale or transfer of its certificates, as the case may  be,  file
  in the office of the tax commission a certificate setting forth the name
  under  which such business is, or is to be, conducted or transacted, and
  the true or real full name or names of the person or persons  conducting
  or  transacting  the  same, with the post office address or addresses of
  said person or persons, unless the party so certifying be a  corporation
  or  trustee, in which event it shall set forth its said principal office
  or place of business and when and where incorporated or organized.  Said
  certificate  shall  be  executed  and duly acknowledged by the person or
  persons so conducting or intending to conduct said business  or  by  the
  president or secretary of the corporation as the case may be.
    In  the  event of a change in the persons composing such firm, company
  or association or of the persons acting  as  such  trustees  or  of  the
  address  of  any such person, firm, company, association, corporation or
  trustees, or termination  of  such  business  or  relationship,  a  like
  certificate  setting  forth  the  facts  with  respect to such change or
  termination shall within ten days thereafter be filed in the  office  of
  the tax commission.
    Any  such  person  acting individually or as a trustee, firm, company,
  association or corporation who shall fail to comply with the  provisions
  of  this  section  shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction
  thereof shall pay a fine of not less than one hundred dollars  nor  more
  than  five hundred dollars or be imprisoned for not more than six months
  or by both such fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.




   §  276.    Power  of  tax  commission.    Every person, firm, company,
  association, corporation or business conducted by a trustee or trustees,
  engaged in whole or in part in  the  making  or  negotiating  of  sales,
  agreements  to  sell,  deliveries or transfers of shares or certificates
  taxable under this article, or conducting  or  transacting  a  brokerage
  business,  hereinafter  in  this  section called "broker", shall keep or
  cause to be kept at some accessible place within the state of New  York,
  a  just  and  true book of account, in such form as may be prescribed by
  the tax commission, wherein shall be plainly  and  legibly  recorded  in
  separate  columns (1) unless provided otherwise by rules and regulations
  of the tax commission, providing for its recording in some other  manner
  in  records  kept by such broker, the date of receipt of every order for
  every sale, agreement to sell, delivery or transfer of  such  shares  or
  certificates together with the name, class and number of shares to which
  such  order  relates  and  the name and address (or other identification
  which refers to records kept by such broker  containing  such  name  and
  address)  of  the person placing the order; (2) the date of making every
  sale, agreement  to  sell,  delivery  or  transfer  of  such  shares  or
  certificates,  the  name  and  the number of shares thereof, the selling
  price, the date of  the  order  or  orders  to  which  such  transaction
  relates;  (3) the name and address (or other identification which refers
  to records kept by such broker, containing such name and address) of the
  seller or transferrer,  and  his  resident  or  nonresident  status,  as
  defined  in  the  provisions  of  section  two hundred seventy-a of this
  chapter; (4) the name of the purchaser or transferee; (5) the face value
  of the adhesive stamps affixed; and (6) the identifying  number  of  the
  bill  or  memorandum of sale used as provided for by section two hundred
  and seventy of this chapter.  This book shall also have recorded therein
  each separate purchase of stock transfer stamps, showing the  date,  the
  amount and from whom purchased.
    Every  association,  company or corporation or business conducted by a
  trustee or trustees shall keep or cause to be kept  at  some  accessible
  place  within  the state of New York a stock certificate book and a just
  and true book of account, transfer ledger or register, in such  form  as
  may  be  prescribed  by the tax commission, wherein shall be plainly and
  legibly recorded in separate columns, the date of making every  transfer
  of  stock,  or other certificates included within this article, the name
  and number of shares thereof, the  serial  number  of  each  surrendered
  certificate,  the name of the parties surrendering such certificate, the
  serial number of the certificate issued in exchange therefor, the number
  of shares covered by said certificate, the name of  the  party  to  whom
  said certificate was issued and the face value of the stamps attached in
  payment  of the tax on the transfer of the certificate.  Evidence of the
  payment of the tax provided for by sections two hundred and seventy  and
  two  hundred  and  seventy-a of this chapter shall be provided in one of
  the following manners and not otherwise, to wit:
    (a)  By attaching to the certificate  surrendered  for  transfer,  the
  stamps  required  for  and any declaration permitted by paragraph (c) of
  subdivision one of section two hundred seventy-a of  this  chapter  with
  respect to such transfer, or
    (b)    If  the stamps and any such declaration are not attached to the
  certificate, but  are  attached  to  the  bill  or  memorandum  of  sale
  effecting  or  evidencing the transfer of such certificate, by attaching
  to said certificate the said bill or memorandum of sale with stamps  and
  declaration, if any, attached, or
    (c)   If the stamps and declaration, if any, covering the transfer are
  attached to a bill or memorandum effecting a transfer  of  one  or  more
  certificates or to one or more certificates included in said transfer, a


 notation must be made upon such certificates, bill or memorandum, as the
  case  may  be,  clearly  specifying  and  identifying the certificate or
  certificates to the sale or  transfer  of  which  the  said  stamps  and
  declaration apply, or
    (d)   If the bill or memorandum bearing such stamps and declaration is
  not attached to the surrendered certificate or certificates to which  it
  applies,  a  notation  must be made upon such bill or memorandum stating
  the serial number or numbers of the certificates to which said  bill  or
  memorandum  applies,  as  provided by section two hundred and seventy of
  this chapter.  It shall also retain and keep all surrendered or canceled
  shares or certificates and all memoranda and any  declarations  relating
  to  the  sale  or  transfer of any thereof.   All such books of account,
  transfer ledgers, registers and certificate books, shall be retained and
  kept as aforesaid for a period of at least four years subsequent to  the
  date  of  the  last  entry made therein as herein required; and all such
  surrendered  or  canceled  shares   or   certificates,   memoranda   and
  declarations  relating to the sale or transfer of shares or certificates
  taxable under this article, shall be retained and kept for a  period  of
  at  least  four  years  from  the date of the delivery thereof.  For the
  purpose of ascertaining whether the tax imposed by this article has been
  paid,  all  such  books  of  account,   transfer   ledgers,   registers,
  certificate  books,  surrendered  or canceled shares or certificates and
  memoranda and declarations relating to the  sale  or  transfer  thereof,
  shall  at all times between the hours of ten o'clock in the forenoon and
  three o'clock in the afternoon,  except  Saturdays,  Sundays  and  legal
  holidays,  be  open  to  examination  by  the tax commission or its duly
  authorized representative.   The  tax  commission  may  consent  to  the
  destruction  of  all  surrendered or canceled shares or certificates and
  all memoranda and any declarations relating  to  the  sale  or  transfer
  thereof  provided  the  tax commission has completed an examination with
  respect to the transactions to which such documents relate, is satisfied
  that the original of such documents  no  longer  need  be  preserved,  a
  record  of  such  documents  is  recorded,  copied  or reproduced by any
  process which accurately  reproduces  or  forms  a  durable  medium  for
  reproducing  the  original and such record is retained for the remainder
  of the applicable four year  period  specified  above  and  is  open  to
  examination  by  the tax commission on the days and during the hours set
  forth above.
    The tax commission by a special proceeding in the  supreme  court  may
  enforce  its  right to examine such books of account, bills or memoranda
  of sale or transfer, transfer ledger, register and certificate books and
  surrendered or canceled shares or certificates  and  declarations  or  a
  record  of  such  shares  or  certificates  and  all  memoranda  and any
  declarations relating to the sale or transfer thereof  recorded,  copied
  or reproduced as herein provided.  If the tax commission ascertains that
  the  tax  provided  for  in this article has not been paid, the attorney
  general, at the instance of the commission, shall bring an action in its
  name as such tax commission, in any court of competent jurisdiction  for
  the  recovery  of  such  tax  and for any penalty incurred by any person
  under the provisions of this article.
    Every person, firm, company, association or  corporation  or  business
  conducted  by a trustee or trustees that shall fail to keep such book of
  account or bills of memoranda of sale or transfer, or  transfer  ledger,
  register  or  certificate  book  or  surrendered  or  canceled shares or
  certificates or declarations as herein required, or who alters, cancels,
  obliterates or destroys any part  of  said  records,  except  as  herein
  permitted,  or  makes  any  false  entry therein, or who shall refuse to
  permit the tax commission  or  any  of  its  authorized  representatives


 freely  to  examine  any  of said books, records or papers at any of the
  times herein provided, or who shall in any other respect violate any  of
  the  provisions  of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor
  and  on  conviction  thereof shall for each and every such offense pay a
  fine of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than  five  thousand
  dollars,  or  be imprisoned not less than three months nor more than one
  year, or both in the discretion of the court.




   §  277.    Penalties;  how  recovered.    Any  person,  firm, company,
  association or corporation,  or  business  conducted  by  a  trustee  or
  trustees that shall violate any of the provisions of section two hundred
  seventy,   section   two   hundred  seventy-a  or  section  two  hundred
  seventy-two of this chapter shall, in addition to  the  other  penalties
  provided  for in this article, be subject to a penalty of one dollar for
  each and every share of stock or of other interest  taxable  under  this
  article so sold or transferred, or transferred or entered upon the books
  of  the corporation or trustees, as the case may be, without the payment
  of the tax by this  article  imposed  thereon.    Such  penalty  may  be
  compromised  by the tax commission.  Any person who shall violate any of
  the other provisions of this article shall, in  addition  to  the  other
  penalties  provided for in this article, be subject to a penalty of five
  hundred dollars for each and every such violation.
    The attorney-general at the instance of the tax commission shall bring
  an action in its name as such tax commission in any court  of  competent
  jurisdiction  for  the  recovery of any penalty imposed by this section.
  All moneys collected as penalties shall be paid into the stock  transfer
  tax  fund.    In  an action against a corporation or trustees, or its or
  their transfer agent to recover a penalty because of the transfer  of  a
  certificate,  upon  the  books or records of the corporation or trustees
  without requiring the payment of the tax by this  article  imposed,  the
  failure  of  the corporation or trustees or its or their transfer agent,
  on  the  demand  of  the  tax  commission   or   its   duly   authorized
  representative,  to  produce the surrendered certificate or memoranda of
  sale  with  the  required  stamps  and  any  declaration  prescribed  by
  paragraph  (c)  of  subdivision  one of section two hundred seventy-a of
  this chapter, if required, attached, shall constitute prima facie  proof
  of  the  nonpayment  of the taxes imposed by section two hundred seventy
  and section two hundred seventy-a of this chapter.




   §  278.    Effect  of failure to pay tax.  No transfer of certificates
  taxable under this article made after June first, nineteen  hundred  and
  five,  on  which  a tax is imposed by this article, and which tax is not
  paid at the time of such transfer shall be made the basis of any  action
  or  legal  proceedings, nor, except in a proceeding under articles ten-c
  and twenty-six of this  chapter,  shall  proof  thereof  be  offered  or
  received in evidence in any court in this state.




   §  279.    Application of taxes.  The taxes imposed under this article
  and the revenues thereof,  after  the  deduction  of  refunds  of  taxes
  erroneously  paid,  shall  be  paid by the tax commission into the stock
  transfer tax fund to the credit of  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance.




   §  279-a.  Determination  of  tax.  If any person fails to pay any tax
  required by this article, the commissioner of taxation and finance shall
  determine the amount of tax due at any time within five years after  the
  tax  became  payable and shall give written notice of such determination
  to the person or persons liable therefor.   Notwithstanding any  of  the
  foregoing  provisions  of  this section, where, before the expiration of
  the time prescribed in this section for the determination of  tax,  both
  the commissioner of taxation and finance and the taxpayer have consented
  in  writing  to  its  determination  after  such  time,  the  tax may be
  determined at any time prior to the  expiration  of  the  period  agreed
  upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements
  in  writing  made  before the expiration of the period previously agreed
  upon. Such a determination shall finally and  irrevocably  fix  the  tax
  unless  the  person against whom it is assessed shall within thirty days
  after the mailing of notice of such determination petition the  division
  of  tax  appeals  for  a hearing. After such hearing the division of tax
  appeals  shall  give  written  notice  of  the  determination   of   the
  administrative law judge to the person against whom the tax was assessed
  and  to the commissioner of taxation and finance. Such determination may
  be reviewed by the tax appeals tribunal as provided in article forty  of
  this  chapter.  The decision of the tax appeals tribunal may be reviewed
  as provided in section two thousand sixteen  of  this  chapter  but  the
  proceeding  may  not be commenced unless the amount of tax stated in the
  determination with penalties thereon, if  any,  shall  have  first  been
  deposited   with  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  and  an
  undertaking filed with him in such amount and with such  sureties  as  a
  justice  of  the  supreme  court shall approve to the effect that if the
  proceeding be dismissed or the determination  confirmed  the  petitioner
  will  pay  all  costs  and  charges  which may accrue against him in the
  prosecution of the proceeding or at the option of  the  petitioner  such
  undertaking  may  be  in  a  sum sufficient to cover the tax, penalties,
  costs and charges aforesaid in which event the petitioner shall  not  be
  required  to  pay such tax and penalties as a condition precedent to the
  commencement of the proceeding. The remedy provided by this section  for
  a  review  of  the  decision  of  the  tax appeals tribunal shall be the
  exclusive remedy available to judicially  determine  the  liability  for
  taxes under this article.




   §  279-b.    Warrant for the collection of taxes.  Whenever any person
  shall fail to pay any tax he is required to pay under the provisions  of
  this  article, the tax commission may issue a warrant under its official
  seal, directed to the sheriff of any county of the state, commanding him
  to levy upon and sell the real and personal  property  of  such  person,
  found within his county, for the payment of the amount thereof, with the
  penalties, interest and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return
  such  warrant to the tax commission and to pay to it the money collected
  by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of  such  warrant.
  The  sheriff  shall  within  five days after the receipt of the warrant,
  file with the clerk of his county a  copy  thereof,  and  thereupon  the
  clerk  shall  enter  in  the  judgment  docket  the  name  of the person
  mentioned in the warrant, and the amount of the tax  and  penalties  for
  which  the  warrant  is issued and the date when such copy is filed, and
  thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed  shall  become  a  lien
  upon  the title to and interest in real property or chattels real of the
  person against whom the warrant is  issued  in  the  same  manner  as  a
  judgment  duly  docketed in the office of such clerk.  The sheriff shall
  thereupon proceed upon the warrant in all respects,  with  like  effect,
  and in the same manner prescribed by law in respect to executions issued
  against  property  upon  judgments  of  a  court of record, and shall be
  entitled to the same fees for his services in executing the warrant,  to
  be  collected  in  the  same  manner.    In  the  discretion  of the tax
  commission a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be  issued  and
  directed  to  any  officer or employee of the department of taxation and
  finance, and in the execution thereof such  officer  or  employee  shall
  have  all  the  powers  conferred  by  law  upon  sheriffs, but shall be
  entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid  in
  the  performance of such duty.  Upon such filing of a copy of a warrant,
  the tax commission shall have the same remedies to enforce the claim for
  taxes against the person as if the people of  the  state  had  recovered
  judgment against such person for the amount of the tax.




   § 280.  Refund  of  tax erroneously paid. If any stamp or stamps shall
  have been erroneously affixed to  any  book,  certificate,  or  bill  or
  memorandum  of  sale,  or  if  any tax provided by this article shall be
  erroneously paid otherwise than by the use of a stamp or stamps, the tax
  commission may, upon presentation of a claim  for  the  amount  of  such
  stamp   or   stamps,  or  tax,  and  upon  the  production  of  evidence
  satisfactory to it that such stamp or stamps was or were so  erroneously
  affixed, or such tax was so erroneously paid, so as to cause loss to the
  person  or  persons  making  such  claim,  pay  such amount or such part
  thereof as it may allow, to such claimant out of  any  moneys  collected
  under this article. Provided, however, that where such erroneous payment
  was  made otherwise than by the use of stamps pursuant to the provisions
  of section two hundred eighty-one-a hereof, and resulted from payment of
  tax in excess of the amount due under subdivision  two  of  section  two
  hundred seventy-a of this chapter in lieu of the presentation of a claim
  for  refund  an adjustment for such erroneous payment may be made on the
  written report required to be made to the exchange, affiliated  clearing
  corporation  or  authorized  agency if such adjustment is made on such a
  written  report  filed  within  thirty  business  days  following   such
  erroneous payment, in such form and with such substantiating evidence as
  the  tax  commission may prescribe and provided further that at the time
  of  the  making  of  such  adjustment  the  person,  firm,  company   or
  association  making such report has either paid to the person or persons
  erroneously charged with such tax the amount of such overpayment or  has
  applied  such  amount  in  reduction  of any amount owing to it from the
  person or persons so charged. Any claim for refund shall be presented to
  the tax commission in writing, duly verified, and shall state  the  full
  name  and  address of the claimant, the date of such erroneous affixing,
  or other payment of the tax, the face value of such stamp or stamps,  or
  the amount of such tax, as the case may be, and contain such evidence as
  may  be available upon which the demand for such refund is based. If the
  claim is based on the erroneous affixing of a stamp or stamps the  claim
  shall describe the instrument to which the stamp or stamps were affixed.
  Such  claims  shall  be  presented within two years after such erroneous
  affixing or payment, as the case may be, except if  an  agreement  under
  the  provisions  of  section  two  hundred seventy-nine-a (extending the
  period for determination of tax imposed by this article) is made  within
  the two-year period for the filing of a claim for refund provided for in
  this  section, the period for filing a claim for refund shall not expire
  prior to six months after the expiration of the period  within  which  a
  determination  may  be  made  pursuant to the agreement or any extension
  thereof. The tax commission shall grant or deny such claim in  whole  or
  in part and shall notify the claimant by mail of its determination. Such
  determination  shall  be final and irrevocable unless the claimant shall
  within thirty days after the mailing of  notice  of  such  determination
  apply  to  the  tax commission for a hearing. After such hearing the tax
  commission shall mail notice  of  its  decision  to  the  claimant.  The
  decision   of   the   tax  commission  may  be  reviewed  under  article
  seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if a proceeding  under
  that  article  is  commenced within ninety days after the mailing of the
  notice of such decision. However, such a proceeding may not be commenced
  unless an undertaking is filed with the tax commission  in  such  amount
  and  with  such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve
  to the effect that if  the  proceeding  be  dismissed  or  the  decision
  confirmed the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue
  against him in the prosecution of the proceeding. The remedy provided by
  this  section  for review of the decision of the tax commission shall be


 the exclusive remedy available to judicially determine the liability for
  taxes under this article.




   § 280-a. Rebate for stock transfer tax paid; penalty for false claims.
  1.  Except as otherwise provided in subdivision fifteen of this section,
  where a tax shall have been paid under this article  a  portion  of  the
  amount  paid shall be allowed as a rebate and such portion shall be paid
  to the taxpayer but only to the extent that moneys are available for the
  payment of such rebates in the stock transfer incentive fund established
  pursuant to section ninety-two-i of the state finance law.  The  portion
  of  the  amount  of tax paid which is to be allowed as a rebate shall be
  thirty percent of the tax incurred and paid on transactions  subject  to
  the  stock  transfer  tax occurring on and after October first, nineteen
  hundred seventy-nine and on  or  before  September  thirtieth,  nineteen
  hundred  eighty  and  sixty percent of the tax incurred and paid on such
  transactions occurring on and  after  October  first,  nineteen  hundred
  eighty and on or before September thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-one
  and  all  of  the  amount of tax incurred and paid shall be allowed as a
  rebate on transactions subject to the stock transfer  tax  occurring  on
  and after October first, nineteen hundred eighty-one.
    2.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of subdivision one of this section
  with respect to the percentages of tax allowable as rebates, the portion
  of the amount of stock transfer tax paid which is to  be  allowed  as  a
  rebate  to  a nonresident shall be fifty percent of the tax incurred and
  paid on transactions subject to stock  transfer  tax  occurring  on  and
  after  October  first,  nineteen  hundred seventy-seven and on or before
  July thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight and  thirty-seven  and
  one-half  percent  with  respect  to  such transactions occurring on and
  after August first, nineteen hundred  seventy-eight  and  on  or  before
  September   thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty,  and  thereafter  the
  portions  set  forth  in  subdivision  one  of  this  section  shall  be
  applicable.
    2-a.  In  addition  to  the  rebate  allowable under the provisions of
  subdivision one of this section, the portion  of  the  amount  of  stock
  transfer  tax  paid  which  is  to be allowed as a rebate to any person,
  firm,  company  or  corporation  registered  with  the   United   States
  securities  and exchange commission in accordance with subsection (b) of
  section fifteen of the  securities  exchange  act  of  nineteen  hundred
  thirty-four,  as  amended,  and  acting  as  a  dealer  in a transaction
  described in paragraph (e) of subdivision twelve of this section,  other
  than such a person, firm, company or corporation liable to file a report
  or  return under article nine-A of this chapter, or article twenty-three
  of this chapter, (as such article was in effect on  or  before  December
  thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-two), shall be one hundred percent of
  the  stock transfer tax incurred and paid on transactions subject to the
  stock transfer tax executed by such person, firm, company or corporation
  pursuant to the acceptance of an order  placed  through  an  intermarket
  linkage  system developed pursuant to subsection (a) of section eleven-A
  of such securities exchange act under a plan submitted by  one  or  more
  national   securities  exchanges  or  national  securities  associations
  registered with such securities and exchange commission occurring on and
  after April seventeenth, nineteen hundred seventy-eight and on or before
  September thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-nine, seventy  percent  of
  the  tax  incurred and paid on such a transaction occurring on and after
  October first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine and on or before  September
  thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty and forty percent of the tax incurred
  and  paid  on  such  a transaction occurring on and after October first,
  nineteen hundred eighty and on or before September  thirtieth,  nineteen
  hundred  eighty-one. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the net
  amount to be rebated to any such person, firm,  company  or  corporation
  under  this  subdivision with respect to stock transfer tax allowable as


 rebates during  each  of  the  periods  ending  on  September  thirtieth
  hereinbefore  set  forth shall not be allowed or paid prior to the first
  day of the eighth month following September thirtieth of  each  of  such
  periods  nor  until  the  subsequent  date  on which the commissioner of
  taxation and finance  shall  next  determine  the  amount  allowable  as
  rebates  pursuant to the provisions of section ninety-two-i of the state
  finance law, provided, however, that the net amount to  be  allowed  for
  the  April seventeenth, nineteen hundred seventy-eight through September
  thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-eight period shall not be allowed or
  paid until the last business day of June, nineteen hundred seventy-nine.
    No rebate shall be allowed under this subdivision with respect to  any
  stock  transfer tax incurred in a market making transaction occurring on
  or after October first, nineteen hundred eighty-one. No rebate shall  be
  allowed  or  paid  under  this  subdivision  for stock transfer tax paid
  pursuant to section two hundred seventy-nine-a of this chapter nor shall
  any rebate be allowed  or  paid  until  the  person,  firm,  company  or
  corporation claiming the rebate complies with the rules, regulations and
  instructions  of  the  state  tax  commission  issued under this article
  including furnishing of a just and true book of account within the state
  as may be required by the state tax commission.
    3. Except as provided in subdivision six of this section, rebates  may
  be  paid  only  upon the filing of a claim for rebate with the state tax
  commission. All claims for rebate shall be presented in  such  form  and
  contain   such  information  as  the  state  tax  commission,  by  rule,
  regulation or instruction, shall prescribe and shall be presented within
  two years after the affixing and cancelling of stock transfer tax stamps
  or payment of the tax otherwise than by the use of stamps.
    4. Every such claim shall include a certificate by or on behalf of the
  party presenting the same to the  effect  that  it  is  just,  true  and
  correct,  that  the amount of stock transfer tax stated thereon has been
  paid to the state and that the amount of rebate  requested  is  actually
  due  and  owing. The state tax commission, if satisfied that the tax has
  actually been paid,  shall  rebate  the  same  in  accordance  with  the
  provisions  of  this  section  on  the  audit  and  warrant of the state
  comptroller on vouchers approved by the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance.
    5.  The  state  tax  commission  shall grant or deny such claim in the
  manner provided in section two hundred eighty of this  article  and  the
  remaining  provisions of such section, relating to determination of tax,
  hearing, decision of the state tax commission, the exclusive  manner  of
  review  of  such  decision, and the requirement of an undertaking, shall
  apply to the provisions of this section with the same force  and  effect
  as  if  the  language of such section had been incorporated in full into
  this section and  had  expressly  referred  to  the  rebate  under  this
  section,  except  to  the  extent  that  any  such  provision  is either
  inconsistent with or not relevant to this  section.  All  of  the  other
  provisions of this article relating to refunds shall apply to the rebate
  of tax provided for by this section in the same manner and with the same
  force  and  effect  as  if  the  language  of  such  provisions had been
  incorporated in full into this section and had expressly referred to the
  rebates of tax provided for under this section,  except  to  the  extent
  that  any such provision is either inconsistent with a provision of this
  section or is not relevant to this section  and  except  that  the  term
  "refund" as used in such provisions shall be read as "rebate".
    6.   (a)   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  section  two  hundred
  eighty-one-a of this chapter, the tax imposed by  this  article  may  be
  paid,  and  rebates  provided  for  in  subdivisions one and two of this
  section shall be allowed without the filing of  the  claim  required  by


 subdivision  three of this section, in the manner and upon the filing of
  the report referred to in paragraph (b) of this subdivision in the  case
  where  payment  of the tax imposed by this article is made by any member
  of  any  securities  exchange  or  any registered dealer who or which is
  permitted or required pursuant to the provisions  of  such  section  two
  hundred  eighty-one-a of this chapter to pay such tax without the use of
  the stamps prescribed by this article.
    (b) On the written  report  required  to  be  made  to  or  through  a
  securities  exchange  located  within  this  state,  affiliated clearing
  corporation or to a qualified securities  exchange,  qualified  clearing
  corporation, authorized agency or the tax commission by each such member
  or  dealer under such section two hundred eighty-one-a, there shall also
  be shown the amount of the rebate of tax shown to be due thereon,  which
  would  be  allowable  by  this section if the full amount of tax is paid
  with such report. The net amount required to be paid for the account  of
  the  tax  commission  to  or  through  such exchange located within this
  state, affiliated clearing corporation or to such authorized agency  and
  remitted  to  the tax commission pursuant to such section or such amount
  required to be paid to the tax commission shall be  the  amount  of  tax
  shown to be due on such written report (determined without regard to any
  rebate allowable under this section) less the amount of any such rebate,
  subject  to  the  provisions  of  subdivision  eight  of  this  section.
  Notwithstanding the provisions of section two  hundred  eighty-one-a  of
  this  article, on the next-to-the-last business day of the department of
  taxation and finance in each of the months of September, December, March
  and June, each such member or dealer  shall  show  on  such  report  the
  aggregate amount of rebates shown daily on such report for the period of
  three  full  months ending on such next-to-the-last business day. On the
  last business day of each of  such  months,  an  amount  equal  to  such
  aggregate  amount shall be paid by such member or dealer for the account
  of the tax commission to or through such exchange  located  within  this
  state, affiliated clearing corporation or authorized agency and remitted
  by  such  exchange, affiliated clearing corporation or authorized agency
  to the tax commission by separate check or wire transfer. The amount  so
  remitted  shall  constitute  the  total  amount  of  rebates provided in
  subdivisions one and two of this section payable in the manner described
  in this subdivision, which  amount  shall  be  included  in  the  amount
  required  to  be  paid  from  the stock transfer tax fund into the stock
  transfer incentive fund on each  such  last  day  pursuant  to  sections
  ninety-two-b  and  ninety-two-i  of  the  state  finance  law; provided,
  however, that if such exchange located  within  this  state,  affiliated
  clearing  corporation, qualified securities exchange, qualified clearing
  corporation or authorized agency shall determine that the payment by any
  member or dealer of any tax imposed by this article will be  jeopardized
  by  delay,  it  shall  forthwith  notify  the  tax  commission  of  such
  condition, or if the tax commission believes that the collection of  any
  tax  will  be  jeopardized by delay, it may determine the amount of such
  tax and assess the same against any such member or dealer prior  to  the
  filing  of  his report and prior to the date when his report is required
  to be made to an exchange located within this state, affiliated clearing
  corporation,   qualified   securities   exchange,   qualified   clearing
  corporation  or authorized agency. The amount so determined shall become
  due and payable to the tax commission by the member  or  dealer  against
  whom  such  a  jeopardy assessment is made, as soon as notice thereof is
  given to  him  personally  or  by  registered  or  certified  mail.  The
  provisions of section two hundred seventy-nine-a shall apply to any such
  determination  except  to  the extent that they may be inconsistent with
  the provisions of this subdivision. The tax  commission  may  abate  any


 jeopardy  assessment  if  it  finds  that  jeopardy  does not exist. The
  collection of any jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing  with  the
  tax  commission a bond issued by a surety company authorized to transact
  business  in  this state and approved by the superintendent of financial
  services as to solvency and responsibility, conditioned upon payment  of
  the  amount  assessed, or any lesser amount to which such assessment may
  be reduced by the tax  commission  or  by  a  proceeding  under  article
  seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules as provided in section
  two  hundred seventy-nine-a of this chapter such payment to be made when
  the assessment or any such reduction thereof shall have become final and
  not subject to further review. If such a bond is filed and thereafter  a
  proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
  rules is commenced as provided in section  two  hundred  seventy-nine-a,
  deposit  of  the  taxes  assessed  shall  not be required as a condition
  precedent to the commencement  of  such  proceeding.  Where  a  jeopardy
  assessment  is  made,  any property seized for the collection of the tax
  shall not be sold (i) until expiration  of  the  time  to  apply  for  a
  hearing  as  provided  in  such section, and (ii) if such application is
  timely filed,  until  the  expiration  of  ninety  days  after  the  tax
  commission mailed notice of its determination to the person against whom
  the  assessment is made; provided, however, such property may be sold at
  any time if such person has failed to attend a hearing of which  he  has
  been  duly  notified,  or  if  he  consents  to  the sale, or if the tax
  commission determines that the expenses of conservation and  maintenance
  will  greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property is perishable.
  The amount of any and all rebates of the tax  imposed  by  this  article
  paid  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall  be  credited or caused to be
  credited by such exchange located within this state, affiliated clearing
  corporation,   qualified   securities   exchange,   qualified   clearing
  corporation  or  authorized agency to or for the benefit of the taxpayer
  incurring liability for such tax.
    (c) If a rebate is paid in the manner provided in this subdivision, no
  further rebate shall be allowable but any stock transfer tax paid  to  a
  member  or  dealer by a taxpayer otherwise entitled to rebate under this
  section shall be paid by such member or dealer to the taxpayer.
    (d) The amounts of the rebates provided for under subdivisions one and
  two of this section paid in the  manner  provided  in  this  subdivision
  shall  be  shown  separately  on  all  reports  prescribed  by  the  tax
  commission  under  such  section  and  shall  be   evidenced   by   such
  certification as the tax commission may prescribe.
    (e)  The  tax  commission  may  require  any such member or registered
  dealer to file with the department of taxation and finance a bond issued
  by a surety company approved by the superintendent of financial services
  as to solvency and responsibility and authorized to transact business in
  the state, in such amount as the tax commission may fix, to  secure  the
  payment  of any taxes due from such member or dealer pursuant to section
  two hundred eighty-one-a. The tax commission may  require  that  such  a
  bond be filed before any tax due under this article from any such member
  or  dealer  may  be  reported  and  paid  under  the  provisions of this
  subdivision, or at any time when in its judgment the same  is  necessary
  as  a  protection  to  the  revenues under this article. In lieu of such
  bond, such member or dealer may deposit securities approved by  the  tax
  commission,  in  such amount as it may prescribe, which securities shall
  be kept in the joint custody of the comptroller and the commissioner  of
  taxation and finance and may be sold by the tax commission if it becomes
  necessary  so  to  do  in order to recover any sums due from such person
  pursuant to this article; but no such sale shall  be  held  until  after
  such  person  shall have had opportunity to litigate the validity of any


 tax if it elects so to do. Upon any such  sale,  the  surplus,  if  any,
  above  the sums due under this article, shall be returned to such member
  or dealer.
    7. If the commissioner of taxation and finance makes the determination
  that  rebates  payable  exceed  moneys  available  in the stock transfer
  incentive fund for paying such rebates and if any member or dealer shall
  advance and pay the amount of  tax,  imposed  by  this  article  without
  taking  account  of  rebates,  either for himself or for which any other
  taxpayer is entitled to claim a rebate pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
  subdivision six of this section, such member or dealer shall be entitled
  to  a  rebate  for  the  amount  of such tax advanced and paid by him on
  behalf of such other taxpayer in the amount of the rebate  allowable  to
  such  taxpayer  and  in  the  amount  of the rebate allowable to himself
  whenever  such  commissioner  determines  that  sufficient   funds   are
  available in the stock transfer incentive fund for paying such rebate.
    8.  The  amount  of  any erroneous or excessive rebate paid or allowed
  under this section may be determined by the state tax commission and may
  be recovered from such claimant in the same  manner  as  a  tax  imposed
  under this article, provided, however, that any such determination shall
  be  made within five years after the date of such erroneous or excessive
  rebate.
    9. Any taxpayer, broker or dealer who or which files or causes  to  be
  filed any claim for or report of rebate permitted or required under this
  article which is willfully false shall be guilty of a felony.
    10. If any part of any claim for or report of rebate of stock transfer
  tax  is  false  or  fraudulent, any person who files such claim or makes
  such report shall, in addition to any other penalties provided  by  this
  article,  be  subject  to a penalty of five hundred dollars for each and
  every violation. The state tax commission may determine  the  amount  of
  any  such  penalty  to be due from any such person in the same manner as
  the tax imposed by  this  article,  provided,  however,  that  any  such
  determination shall be made at any time.
    11.  The  state  tax  commission  shall make rules and regulations and
  issue instructions to effectuate the purposes of  this  section  and  to
  provide  for  payments  to  and  from  and  administration  of the stock
  transfer tax fund and the stock transfer incentive fund and  shall  have
  all  the  rights  and  powers  as  set  forth  in  section  two  hundred
  seventy-six of this article to examine transactions and require  records
  to  be  kept  and declarations and certifications to be made and kept as
  may be required for such purposes. If any member or dealer described  in
  subdivision  six  of  this  section  shall violate any provision of this
  section or any reasonable rule, regulation or instruction made or issued
  pursuant  thereto,  such  member  or  dealer  may  upon  notice  thereof
  thereafter  be  denied rebates by the state tax commission in accordance
  with rules and regulations promulgated  by  such  commission.  Provided,
  that  nothing  herein  shall  limit the right to file a claim for rebate
  under this section.
    12. For the purposes of this section the following  terms  shall  have
  the following meanings:
    (a)  A  "nonresident" shall mean an individual or group of individuals
  jointly owning securities (but including partnerships only if  organized

  who is not, or no one of whom is, a resident.
    (b) A "resident" means an individual who on the day upon which the tax

  registered  with  the  attorney  general  of  the state of New York as a
  dealer in securities other than upon any such exchange  (hereinafter  in
  this  section referred to as a "registered dealer"), who is permitted or
  required pursuant to any rules and regulations promulgated  by  the  tax
  commission   pursuant   to   the   provisions  of  section  two  hundred
  eighty-one-a of this chapter, to pay the tax  imposed  by  this  article
  without   the  use  of  the  stamps  prescribed  by  this  article,  the
  transaction is certified,  in  such  form  as  the  tax  commission  may
  prescribe, in the report required to be made to or through such exchange
  located  within this state, or its affiliated clearing corporation or to
  a qualified securities exchange, qualified clearing corporation  or  any
  authorized  agency  by  rules  and  regulations  promulgated  by the tax
  commission pursuant to section two hundred eighty-one-a of this chapter,
  as being a transaction by  a  nonresident.  The  certification  in  such
  report may be made by such member of a securities exchange or registered
  dealer if he either (i) has obtained from such nonresident a declaration
  in  the  form  prescribed  by  the  tax  commission,  or  (ii)  has  met
  requirements set forth in rules and regulations promulgated by  the  tax
  commission  establishing  that  the transaction is made by a nonresident
  and (iii) has not, on or after the date of obtaining such declaration or
  its delivery and filing, received from such nonresident either a  notice


 of  cancellation, in the form prescribed in clause (iii) of subparagraph
  two of paragraph (d)  of  this  subdivision,  or  has  no  knowledge  or
  reasonable  grounds  to believe that the status of such nonresident as a
  nonresident has changed.
    (d)  (1)  Any person who shall knowingly make any false statement in a
  declaration provided for by paragraph (c) of this subdivision  shall  be
  guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be liable to a
  fine  of  not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars,
  or be imprisoned for not more than one year, or be subject to both  such
  fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.
    (2) Any person who--
    (i)  having  executed,  filed  with  and  delivered  to  a member of a
  securities exchange or a registered dealer a declaration provided for by
  paragraph (c) of this subdivision;
    (ii) thereafter ceases knowingly to be a nonresident;
    (iii) fails to execute, file and deliver a notice of  cancellation  of
  such declaration, with and to such member or dealer; and
    (iv)  after  ceasing  to  be  such  a  nonresident  and  prior  to the
  execution, filing and delivery of  such  notice  of  cancellation,  with
  intent  to  cause  a rebate to be made from the stock transfer incentive
  fund in excess of the rebate allowable to  residents  under  subdivision
  one of this section, places and allows to be executed an order with such
  member  or dealer where the sale, agreement to sell, memorandum of sale,
  delivery or transfer of any shares or certificates described in  section
  two  hundred  seventy of this chapter is subject to the taxes imposed by
  this chapter; shall be guilty  of  a  misdemeanor  and  upon  conviction
  thereof shall be liable to a fine of not less than five hundred nor more
  than  one thousand dollars, or be imprisoned for not more than one year,
  or be subject to both such fine and imprisonment, in the  discretion  of
  the court.
    (e)  The  term  "market making transaction" shall mean any transaction
  involving a sale (including a short sale)  by  a  dealer  of  shares  or
  certificates  subject  to the tax imposed by this article, provided such
  shares or certificates are sold:
    (1) as stock in trade or inventory or as property held for sale in the
  ordinary course of such dealer's trade or business (including  transfers
  which are part of an underwriting),
    (2)  in  (i) a bona fide arbitrage transaction; (ii) a bona fide hedge
  transaction involving a long or short position in  any  equity  security
  and  a  long  or  short  position  in a security entitling the holder to
  acquire or  sell  such  equity  security;  or  (iii)  a  risk  arbitrage
  transaction  in  connection  with  a  merger, acquisition, tender offer,
  recapitalization, reorganization, or similar transaction, or
    (3) to offset a transaction made in error.
    Provided, however, that, except as to clause (iii) of subparagraph two
  of this paragraph,  the  term  "market  making  transaction"  shall  not
  include  any  sale of shares or certificates identified in such dealer's
  records as a security held for investment within the meaning of  section
  twelve hundred thirty-six of the internal revenue code.
    13.  The state tax commission may provide that where a declaration has
  been executed, filed and delivered to a member of a securities  exchange
  or  a  registered  dealer  under  subdivision one of section two hundred
  seventy-a of this article and kept by such member or dealer pursuant  to
  rules,  regulations  and  instructions of the state tax commission, such
  declaration shall constitute the declaration of  the  nonresident  under
  subdivision twelve of this section.
    14.  Where there has been a determination of the maximum amount of tax
  on a single qualifying sale under section two hundred seventy-e of  this


 chapter,  the  foregoing  provisions  of this section shall not apply to
  such a single qualifying sale  until  October  first,  nineteen  hundred
  seventy-nine and thereafter, provided, however, for the period beginning
  October  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-nine  and  ending  September
  thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty, the portion of the maximum amount of
  tax to be rebated on such single qualifying sale shall not exceed thirty
  percent.
    15. (a) For the purpose of allowing  the  rebate  authorized  by  this
  section to a taxpayer, other than a taxpayer regarding which subdivision
  six of this section is applicable, any person liable for the tax imposed
  by  this  article  who  or  which  purchases stamps issued to denote the
  payment of the tax imposed by this article or any agent  of  a  taxpayer
  who purchases such stamps, provided such purchase was made from a fiscal
  agent  appointed  for  the  sale  of  such  stamps, may claim the rebate
  authorized by subdivision one of this section by filing a claim in  such
  form  and  containing  such  information as the state tax commission, by
  rule, regulation or instruction shall prescribe,  but  all  such  claims
  under  this  subdivision  shall  be presented within two years after the
  purchase of such stamps, provided, however,  all  such  claims  must  be
  accompanied  by  the  receipt  for  the  purchase  of stamps in the form
  approved by the tax commission. The tax commission,  if  satisfied  that
  the  moneys  from  the  purchase  of such stamps have been paid from the
  stock transfer tax fund into the stock transfer  incentive  fund,  shall
  rebate  the  same  to  the  person  or agent who or which purchased such
  stamps from such fund. All of  the  other  provisions  of  this  section
  regarding  rebates  shall  apply to the method of rebate of tax provided
  for by this subdivision in the same manner and with the same  force  and
  effect  as  if  the language of such provisions had been incorporated in
  full into this subdivision and had expressly referred to the  claim  for
  rebate  of  tax  provided  for by this subdivision, except to the extent
  that any such provision is either inconsistent with a provision of  this
  section or is not relevant to this subdivision.
    (b) If a rebate is paid in the manner provided in this subdivision, no
  further  rebate  shall  be  allowable  under  this section but any stock
  transfer tax paid by a taxpayer otherwise entitled to rebate under  this
  section  shall  be  paid  to  such  taxpayer  by the claimant under this
  subdivision.
    (c) If a rebate is paid in the manner provided  by  this  subdivision,
  any  refund  or redemption allowable by this article shall be reduced by
  the amount of rebate allowed and paid pursuant to this subdivision,  any
  other provision of this article to the contrary notwithstanding.
    (d)  The  state tax commission shall have all the rights and powers as
  set forth in section two hundred seventy-six of this article to  examine
  transactions  and  require  records  to  be  kept by claimant under this
  subdivision as if such claimant was a person required to comply with the
  provisions of such section two hundred seventy-six.
    (e) If any person liable for the tax or  any  agent  of  the  taxpayer
  shall  violate any provision of this subdivision or any reasonable rule,
  regulation or instruction made or issued pursuant thereto,  such  person
  or agent may upon notice thereof thereafter be denied rebates under this
  subdivision  by  the  state  tax commission in accordance with rules and
  regulations promulgated  by  such  commission.  Provided,  that  nothing
  herein  shall  limit  the  right  to  file  a  claim  for  rebate  under
  subdivision three of this section.
    (f)  If  the  commissioner  of  taxation   and   finance   makes   the
  determination  that rebates payable exceed moneys available in the stock
  transfer incentive fund for paying such rebates and if any person liable
  for the tax imposed by this article or any agent of the  taxpayer  shall


 have  purchased  stamps to pay the amount of tax imposed by this article
  without charging the  taxpayer  or  principal  for  the  amount  of  the
  rebatable  portion of the cost of such stamps allowable to such taxpayer
  or  principal at the time of purchase of such stamps, such person liable
  for the tax or such agent  shall  be  entitled  to  a  rebate  for  such
  rebatable portion of such tax advanced and paid by him on behalf of such
  other  taxpayer  in  the amount of the rebate allowable to such taxpayer
  and in the amount of any  rebate  allowable  to  himself  whenever  such
  commissioner determines that sufficient funds are available in the stock
  transfer incentive fund for paying such rebate.




   § 280-a. Rebate for stock transfer tax paid; penalty for false claims.
  1.  Except as otherwise provided in subdivision fifteen of this section,
  where a tax shall have been paid under this article  a  portion  of  the
  amount  paid shall be allowed as a rebate and such portion shall be paid
  to the taxpayer but only to the extent that moneys are available for the
  payment of such rebates in the stock transfer incentive fund established
  pursuant to section ninety-two-i of the state finance law.  The  portion
  of  the  amount  of tax paid which is to be allowed as a rebate shall be
  thirty percent of the tax incurred and paid on transactions  subject  to
  the  stock  transfer  tax occurring on and after October first, nineteen
  hundred seventy-nine and on  or  before  September  thirtieth,  nineteen
  hundred  eighty  and  sixty percent of the tax incurred and paid on such
  transactions occurring on and  after  October  first,  nineteen  hundred
  eighty and on or before September thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-one
  and  all  of  the  amount of tax incurred and paid shall be allowed as a
  rebate on transactions subject to the stock transfer  tax  occurring  on
  and after October first, nineteen hundred eighty-one.
    2.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of subdivision one of this section
  with respect to the percentages of tax allowable as rebates, the portion
  of the amount of stock transfer tax paid which is to  be  allowed  as  a
  rebate  to  a nonresident shall be fifty percent of the tax incurred and
  paid on transactions subject to stock  transfer  tax  occurring  on  and
  after  October  first,  nineteen  hundred seventy-seven and on or before
  July thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight and  thirty-seven  and
  one-half  percent  with  respect  to  such transactions occurring on and
  after August first, nineteen hundred  seventy-eight  and  on  or  before
  September   thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty,  and  thereafter  the
  portions  set  forth  in  subdivision  one  of  this  section  shall  be
  applicable.
    2-a.  In  addition  to  the  rebate  allowable under the provisions of
  subdivision one of this section, the portion  of  the  amount  of  stock
  transfer  tax  paid  which  is  to be allowed as a rebate to any person,
  firm,  company  or  corporation  registered  with  the   United   States
  securities  and exchange commission in accordance with subsection (b) of
  section fifteen of the  securities  exchange  act  of  nineteen  hundred
  thirty-four,  as  amended,  and  acting  as  a  dealer  in a transaction
  described in paragraph (e) of subdivision twelve of this section,  other
  than such a person, firm, company or corporation liable to file a report
  or  return under article nine-A of this chapter, or article twenty-three
  of this chapter, (as such article was in effect on  or  before  December
  thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-two), shall be one hundred percent of
  the  stock transfer tax incurred and paid on transactions subject to the
  stock transfer tax executed by such person, firm, company or corporation
  pursuant to the acceptance of an order  placed  through  an  intermarket
  linkage  system developed pursuant to subsection (a) of section eleven-A
  of such securities exchange act under a plan submitted by  one  or  more
  national   securities  exchanges  or  national  securities  associations
  registered with such securities and exchange commission occurring on and
  after April seventeenth, nineteen hundred seventy-eight and on or before
  September thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-nine, seventy  percent  of
  the  tax  incurred and paid on such a transaction occurring on and after
  October first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine and on or before  September
  thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty and forty percent of the tax incurred
  and  paid  on  such  a transaction occurring on and after October first,
  nineteen hundred eighty and on or before September  thirtieth,  nineteen
  hundred  eighty-one. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the net
  amount to be rebated to any such person, firm,  company  or  corporation
  under  this  subdivision with respect to stock transfer tax allowable as


 rebates during  each  of  the  periods  ending  on  September  thirtieth
  hereinbefore  set  forth shall not be allowed or paid prior to the first
  day of the eighth month following September thirtieth of  each  of  such
  periods  nor  until  the  subsequent  date  on which the commissioner of
  taxation and finance  shall  next  determine  the  amount  allowable  as
  rebates  pursuant to the provisions of section ninety-two-i of the state
  finance law, provided, however, that the net amount to  be  allowed  for
  the  April seventeenth, nineteen hundred seventy-eight through September
  thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-eight period shall not be allowed or
  paid until the last business day of June, nineteen hundred seventy-nine.
    No rebate shall be allowed under this subdivision with respect to  any
  stock  transfer tax incurred in a market making transaction occurring on
  or after October first, nineteen hundred eighty-one. No rebate shall  be
  allowed  or  paid  under  this  subdivision  for stock transfer tax paid
  pursuant to section two hundred seventy-nine-a of this chapter nor shall
  any rebate be allowed  or  paid  until  the  person,  firm,  company  or
  corporation claiming the rebate complies with the rules, regulations and
  instructions  of  the  state  tax  commission  issued under this article
  including furnishing of a just and true book of account within the state
  as may be required by the state tax commission.
    3. Except as provided in subdivision six of this section, rebates  may
  be  paid  only  upon the filing of a claim for rebate with the state tax
  commission. All claims for rebate shall be presented in  such  form  and
  contain   such  information  as  the  state  tax  commission,  by  rule,
  regulation or instruction, shall prescribe and shall be presented within
  two years after the affixing and cancelling of stock transfer tax stamps
  or payment of the tax otherwise than by the use of stamps.
    4. Every such claim shall include a certificate by or on behalf of the
  party presenting the same to the  effect  that  it  is  just,  true  and
  correct,  that  the amount of stock transfer tax stated thereon has been
  paid to the state and that the amount of rebate  requested  is  actually
  due  and  owing. The state tax commission, if satisfied that the tax has
  actually been paid,  shall  rebate  the  same  in  accordance  with  the
  provisions  of  this  section  on  the  audit  and  warrant of the state
  comptroller on vouchers approved by the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance.
    5.  The  state  tax  commission  shall grant or deny such claim in the
  manner provided in section two hundred eighty of this  article  and  the
  remaining  provisions of such section, relating to determination of tax,
  hearing, decision of the state tax commission, the exclusive  manner  of
  review  of  such  decision, and the requirement of an undertaking, shall
  apply to the provisions of this section with the same force  and  effect
  as  if  the  language of such section had been incorporated in full into
  this section and  had  expressly  referred  to  the  rebate  under  this
  section,  except  to  the  extent  that  any  such  provision  is either
  inconsistent with or not relevant to this  section.  All  of  the  other
  provisions of this article relating to refunds shall apply to the rebate
  of tax provided for by this section in the same manner and with the same
  force  and  effect  as  if  the  language  of  such  provisions had been
  incorporated in full into this section and had expressly referred to the
  rebates of tax provided for under this section,  except  to  the  extent
  that  any such provision is either inconsistent with a provision of this
  section or is not relevant to this section  and  except  that  the  term
  "refund" as used in such provisions shall be read as "rebate".
    6.   (a)   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  section  two  hundred
  eighty-one-a of this chapter, the tax imposed by  this  article  may  be
  paid,  and  rebates  provided  for  in  subdivisions one and two of this
  section shall be allowed without the filing of  the  claim  required  by


 subdivision  three of this section, in the manner and upon the filing of
  the report referred to in paragraph (b) of this subdivision in the  case
  where  payment  of the tax imposed by this article is made by any member
  of  any  securities  exchange  or  any registered dealer who or which is
  permitted or required pursuant to the provisions  of  such  section  two
  hundred  eighty-one-a of this chapter to pay such tax without the use of
  the stamps prescribed by this article.
    (b) On the written  report  required  to  be  made  to  or  through  a
  securities  exchange  located  within  this  state,  affiliated clearing
  corporation or to a qualified securities  exchange,  qualified  clearing
  corporation, authorized agency or the tax commission by each such member
  or  dealer under such section two hundred eighty-one-a, there shall also
  be shown the amount of the rebate of tax shown to be due thereon,  which
  would  be  allowable  by  this section if the full amount of tax is paid
  with such report. The net amount required to be paid for the account  of
  the  tax  commission  to  or  through  such exchange located within this
  state, affiliated clearing corporation or to such authorized agency  and
  remitted  to  the tax commission pursuant to such section or such amount
  required to be paid to the tax commission shall be  the  amount  of  tax
  shown to be due on such written report (determined without regard to any
  rebate allowable under this section) less the amount of any such rebate,
  subject  to  the  provisions  of  subdivision  eight  of  this  section.
  Notwithstanding the provisions of section two  hundred  eighty-one-a  of
  this  article, on the next-to-the-last business day of the department of
  taxation and finance in each of the months of September, December, March
  and June, each such member or dealer  shall  show  on  such  report  the
  aggregate amount of rebates shown daily on such report for the period of
  three  full  months ending on such next-to-the-last business day. On the
  last business day of each of  such  months,  an  amount  equal  to  such
  aggregate  amount shall be paid by such member or dealer for the account
  of the tax commission to or through such exchange  located  within  this
  state, affiliated clearing corporation or authorized agency and remitted
  by  such  exchange, affiliated clearing corporation or authorized agency
  to the tax commission by separate check or wire transfer. The amount  so
  remitted  shall  constitute  the  total  amount  of  rebates provided in
  subdivisions one and two of this section payable in the manner described
  in this subdivision, which  amount  shall  be  included  in  the  amount
  required  to  be  paid  from  the stock transfer tax fund into the stock
  transfer incentive fund on each  such  last  day  pursuant  to  sections
  ninety-two-b  and  ninety-two-i  of  the  state  finance  law; provided,
  however, that if such exchange located  within  this  state,  affiliated
  clearing  corporation, qualified securities exchange, qualified clearing
  corporation or authorized agency shall determine that the payment by any
  member or dealer of any tax imposed by this article will be  jeopardized
  by  delay,  it  shall  forthwith  notify  the  tax  commission  of  such
  condition, or if the tax commission believes that the collection of  any
  tax  will  be  jeopardized by delay, it may determine the amount of such
  tax and assess the same against any such member or dealer prior  to  the
  filing  of  his report and prior to the date when his report is required
  to be made to an exchange located within this state, affiliated clearing
  corporation,   qualified   securities   exchange,   qualified   clearing
  corporation  or authorized agency. The amount so determined shall become
  due and payable to the tax commission by the member  or  dealer  against
  whom  such  a  jeopardy assessment is made, as soon as notice thereof is
  given to  him  personally  or  by  registered  or  certified  mail.  The
  provisions of section two hundred seventy-nine-a shall apply to any such
  determination  except  to  the extent that they may be inconsistent with
  the provisions of this subdivision. The tax  commission  may  abate  any


 jeopardy  assessment  if  it  finds  that  jeopardy  does not exist. The
  collection of any jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing  with  the
  tax  commission a bond issued by a surety company authorized to transact
  business  in  this state and approved by the superintendent of financial
  services as to solvency and responsibility, conditioned upon payment  of
  the  amount  assessed, or any lesser amount to which such assessment may
  be reduced by the tax  commission  or  by  a  proceeding  under  article
  seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules as provided in section
  two  hundred seventy-nine-a of this chapter such payment to be made when
  the assessment or any such reduction thereof shall have become final and
  not subject to further review. If such a bond is filed and thereafter  a
  proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and
  rules is commenced as provided in section  two  hundred  seventy-nine-a,
  deposit  of  the  taxes  assessed  shall  not be required as a condition
  precedent to the commencement  of  such  proceeding.  Where  a  jeopardy
  assessment  is  made,  any property seized for the collection of the tax
  shall not be sold (i) until expiration  of  the  time  to  apply  for  a
  hearing  as  provided  in  such section, and (ii) if such application is
  timely filed,  until  the  expiration  of  ninety  days  after  the  tax
  commission mailed notice of its determination to the person against whom
  the  assessment is made; provided, however, such property may be sold at
  any time if such person has failed to attend a hearing of which  he  has
  been  duly  notified,  or  if  he  consents  to  the sale, or if the tax
  commission determines that the expenses of conservation and  maintenance
  will  greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property is perishable.
  The amount of any and all rebates of the tax  imposed  by  this  article
  paid  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall  be  credited or caused to be
  credited by such exchange located within this state, affiliated clearing
  corporation,   qualified   securities   exchange,   qualified   clearing
  corporation  or  authorized agency to or for the benefit of the taxpayer
  incurring liability for such tax.
    (c) If a rebate is paid in the manner provided in this subdivision, no
  further rebate shall be allowable but any stock transfer tax paid  to  a
  member  or  dealer by a taxpayer otherwise entitled to rebate under this
  section shall be paid by such member or dealer to the taxpayer.
    (d) The amounts of the rebates provided for under subdivisions one and
  two of this section paid in the  manner  provided  in  this  subdivision
  shall  be  shown  separately  on  all  reports  prescribed  by  the  tax
  commission  under  such  section  and  shall  be   evidenced   by   such
  certification as the tax commission may prescribe.
    (e)  The  tax  commission  may  require  any such member or registered
  dealer to file with the department of taxation and finance a bond issued
  by a surety company approved by the superintendent of financial services
  as to solvency and responsibility and authorized to transact business in
  the state, in such amount as the tax commission may fix, to  secure  the
  payment  of any taxes due from such member or dealer pursuant to section
  two hundred eighty-one-a. The tax commission may  require  that  such  a
  bond be filed before any tax due under this article from any such member
  or  dealer  may  be  reported  and  paid  under  the  provisions of this
  subdivision, or at any time when in its judgment the same  is  necessary
  as  a  protection  to  the  revenues under this article. In lieu of such
  bond, such member or dealer may deposit securities approved by  the  tax
  commission,  in  such amount as it may prescribe, which securities shall
  be kept in the joint custody of the comptroller and the commissioner  of
  taxation and finance and may be sold by the tax commission if it becomes
  necessary  so  to  do  in order to recover any sums due from such person
  pursuant to this article; but no such sale shall  be  held  until  after
  such  person  shall have had opportunity to litigate the validity of any


 tax if it elects so to do. Upon any such  sale,  the  surplus,  if  any,
  above  the sums due under this article, shall be returned to such member
  or dealer.
    7. If the commissioner of taxation and finance makes the determination
  that  rebates  payable  exceed  moneys  available  in the stock transfer
  incentive fund for paying such rebates and if any member or dealer shall
  advance and pay the amount of  tax,  imposed  by  this  article  without
  taking  account  of  rebates,  either for himself or for which any other
  taxpayer is entitled to claim a rebate pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
  subdivision six of this section, such member or dealer shall be entitled
  to  a  rebate  for  the  amount  of such tax advanced and paid by him on
  behalf of such other taxpayer in the amount of the rebate  allowable  to
  such  taxpayer  and  in  the  amount  of the rebate allowable to himself
  whenever  such  commissioner  determines  that  sufficient   funds   are
  available in the stock transfer incentive fund for paying such rebate.
    8.  The  amount  of  any erroneous or excessive rebate paid or allowed
  under this section may be determined by the state tax commission and may
  be recovered from such claimant in the same  manner  as  a  tax  imposed
  under this article, provided, however, that any such determination shall
  be  made within five years after the date of such erroneous or excessive
  rebate.
    9. Any taxpayer, broker or dealer who or which files or causes  to  be
  filed any claim for or report of rebate permitted or required under this
  article which is willfully false shall be guilty of a felony.
    10. If any part of any claim for or report of rebate of stock transfer
  tax  is  false  or  fraudulent, any person who files such claim or makes
  such report shall, in addition to any other penalties provided  by  this
  article,  be  subject  to a penalty of five hundred dollars for each and
  every violation. The state tax commission may determine  the  amount  of
  any  such  penalty  to be due from any such person in the same manner as
  the tax imposed by  this  article,  provided,  however,  that  any  such
  determination shall be made at any time.

  intent  to  cause  a rebate to be made from the stock transfer incentive
  fund in excess of the rebate allowable to  residents  under  subdivision
  one of this section, places and allows to be executed an order with such
  member  or dealer where the sale, agreement to sell, memorandum of sale,

  involving a sale (including a short sale)  by  a  dealer  of  shares  or
  certificates  subject  to the tax imposed by this article, provided such
  shares or certificates are sold:

  ordinary course of such dealer's trade or business (including  transfers
  which are part of an underwriting),
    (2)  in  (i) a bona fide arbitrage transaction; (ii) a bona fide hedge
  transaction involving a long or short position in  any  equity  security

  acquire or  sell  such  equity  security;  or  (iii)  a  risk  arbitrage
  transaction  in  connection  with  a  merger, acquisition, tender offer,
  recapitalization, reorganization, or similar transaction, or
    (3) to offset a transaction made in error.
    Provided, however, that, except as to clause (iii) of subparagraph two
  of this paragraph,  the  term  "market  making  transaction"  shall  not
  include  any  sale of shares or certificates identified in such dealer's
  records as a security held for investment within the meaning of  section
  twelve hundred thirty-six of the internal revenue code.
    13.  The state tax commission may provide that where a declaration has
  been executed, filed and delivered to a member of a securities  exchange
  or  a  registered  dealer  under  subdivision one of section two hundred
  seventy-a of this article and kept by such member or dealer pursuant  to
  rules,  regulations  and  instructions of the state tax commission, such
  declaration shall constitute the declaration of  the  nonresident  under
  subdivision twelve of this section.
    14.  Where there has been a determination of the maximum amount of tax
  on a single qualifying sale under section two hundred seventy-e of  this


 chapter,  the  foregoing  provisions  of this section shall not apply to
  such a single qualifying sale  until  October  first,  nineteen  hundred
  seventy-nine and thereafter, provided, however, for the period beginning
  October  first,  nineteen  hundred  seventy-nine  and  ending  September
  thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty, the portion of the maximum amount of
  tax to be rebated on such single qualifying sale shall not exceed thirty
  percent.
    15. (a) For the purpose of allowing  the  rebate  authorized  by  this
  section to a taxpayer, other than a taxpayer regarding which subdivision
  six of this section is applicable, any person liable for the tax imposed
  by  this  article  who  or  which  purchases stamps issued to denote the
  payment of the tax imposed by this article or any agent  of  a  taxpayer
  who purchases such stamps, provided such purchase was made from a fiscal
  agent  appointed  for  the  sale  of  such  stamps, may claim the rebate
  authorized by subdivision one of this section by filing a claim in  such
  form  and  containing  such  information as the state tax commission, by
  rule, regulation or instruction shall prescribe,  but  all  such  claims
  under  this  subdivision  shall  be presented within two years after the
  purchase of such stamps, provided, however,  all  such  claims  must  be
  accompanied  by  the  receipt  for  the  purchase  of stamps in the form
  approved by the tax commission. The tax commission,  if  satisfied  that
  the  moneys  from  the  purchase  of such stamps have been paid from the
  stock transfer tax fund into the stock transfer  incentive  fund,  shall
  rebate  the  same  to  the  person  or agent who or which purchased such
  stamps from such fund. All of  the  other  provisions  of  this  section
  regarding  rebates  shall  apply to the method of rebate of tax provided
  for by this subdivision in the same manner and with the same  force  and
  effect  as  if  the language of such provisions had been incorporated in
  full into this subdivision and had expressly referred to the  claim  for
  rebate  of  tax  provided  for by this subdivision, except to the extent
  that any such provision is either inconsistent with a provision of  this
  section or is not relevant to this subdivision.
    (b) If a rebate is paid in the manner provided in this subdivision, no
  further  rebate  shall  be  allowable  under  this section but any stock
  transfer tax paid by a taxpayer otherwise entitled to rebate under  this
  section  shall  be  paid  to  such  taxpayer  by the claimant under this
  subdivision.
    (c) If a rebate is paid in the manner provided  by  this  subdivision,
  any  refund  or redemption allowable by this article shall be reduced by
  the amount of rebate allowed and paid pursuant to this subdivision,  any
  other provision of this article to the contrary notwithstanding.
    (d)  The  state tax commission shall have all the rights and powers as
  set forth in section two hundred seventy-six of this article to  examine
  transactions  and  require  records  to  be  kept by claimant under this
  subdivision as if such claimant was a person required to comply with the
  provisions of such section two hundred seventy-six.
    (e) If any person liable for the tax or  any  agent  of  the  taxpayer
  shall  violate any provision of this subdivision or any reasonable rule,
  regulation or instruction made or issued pursuant thereto,  such  person
  or agent may upon notice thereof thereafter be denied rebates under this
  subdivision  by  the  state  tax commission in accordance with rules and
  regulations promulgated  by  such  commission.  Provided,  that  nothing
  herein  shall  limit  the  right  to  file  a  claim  for  rebate  under
  subdivision three of this section.
    (f)  If  the  commissioner  of  taxation   and   finance   makes   the
  determination  that rebates payable exceed moneys available in the stock
  transfer incentive fund for paying such rebates and if any person liable
  for the tax imposed by this article or any agent of the  taxpayer  shall


 have  purchased  stamps to pay the amount of tax imposed by this article
  without charging the  taxpayer  or  principal  for  the  amount  of  the
  rebatable  portion of the cost of such stamps allowable to such taxpayer
  or  principal at the time of purchase of such stamps, such person liable
  for the tax or such agent  shall  be  entitled  to  a  rebate  for  such
  rebatable portion of such tax advanced and paid by him on behalf of such
  other  taxpayer  in  the amount of the rebate allowable to such taxpayer
  and in the amount of any  rebate  allowable  to  himself  whenever  such
  commissioner determines that sufficient funds are available in the stock
  transfer incentive fund for paying such rebate.




   §  281.  Statute of limitations not applicable.  The provisions of the
  civil practice law and rules relative  to  the  limitation  of  time  of
  enforcing  a  civil  remedy  shall not apply to any proceeding or action
  taken to levy, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty
  prescribed by this article, provided, however, that no  such  proceeding
  or  action  shall be commenced after the expiration of ten years after a
  tax became due or a penalty incurred, except  that  such  proceeding  or
  action  may  be  commenced  at any time if the failure to pay the tax or
  penalty was with intent, in any manner, to defeat or evade the same.




   §  281-a.   Alternative method of collection.  1.  Notwithstanding any
  other provisions of this article,  the  tax  commission  may  by  rules,

  shall  be  paid to or through such exchange located within this state or
  in the discretion of the tax commission to  or  through  its  affiliated
  clearing  corporation  by  the  person,  firm,  company  or  association
  executing or effecting the sale, delivery or transfer, without  the  use
  of  the  stamps  prescribed by this article; provided that if such taxes
  are paid through such exchange located within this state or  through  an
  affiliated  clearing  corporation,  payment by any member of a qualified
  securities exchange shall be made to a qualified securities exchange  or
  a qualified clearing corporation which has agreed to abide by the rules,
  regulations  and  instructions of the state tax commission and which the
  commission has authorized to  accept  payment  and  any  such  qualified
  securities  exchange  or  qualified  clearing corporation shall pay such
  taxes to such exchange located  within  this  state  or  its  affiliated
  clearing  corporation.  The taxes imposed by this article on any sale or
  transfer executed or effected within this state  by  any  person,  firm,
  corporation,  company  or association required to be registered with the
  attorney general of the state of New York as  a  dealer  in  securities,
  other  than  upon any such exchange, may also be paid without the use of
  the stamps prescribed by this article, under such rules and  regulations
  as  the  tax  commission may prescribe, to any agency duly authorized by
  the tax commission or to  the  tax  commission,  by  the  person,  firm,
  company,  corporation or association executing or effecting such sale or
  transfer without the use of the stamps prescribed by this article.    In
  such  event,  a  written  report  shall be made to such exchange located
  within this state, affiliated clearing corporation, authorized agency or
  the tax commission for each business day  or  such  period  as  the  tax
  commission  may  prescribe,  by  each  such  person,  corporation, firm,
  company or  association  showing  the  amount  of  tax  payable  on  all
  transactions  taxable  under  this  article  and  such  other reasonable
  information as the tax commission may prescribe, provided, however, that
  if such taxes are paid through such exchange located within  this  state
  or  its  affiliated  clearing  corporation  by  a  member of a qualified
  securities exchange, such written report shall be made to the  qualified
  securities   exchange   or  qualified  clearing  corporation,  and  such
  qualified securities exchange or qualified  clearing  corporation  shall
  render  a  report  to  such  exchange  located  within this state or its
  affiliated clearing  corporation  through  which  such  taxes  are  paid
  showing the amount of tax payable on all transactions taxable under this
  article  and such other reasonable information as the tax commission may
  prescribe.  Such reports shall be preserved for such period as  the  tax
  commission  may  prescribe.    At  the  time of making such reports, the
  amount of tax shown  to  be  due  thereon  shall  be  paid  to  the  tax
  commission  or  for the account of the tax commission to or through such
  exchange located within this state, affiliated clearing  corporation  or
  authorized   agency  and  shall  be  remitted  daily,  unless  otherwise
  prescribed by the tax commission, by such exchange, affiliated  clearing
  corporation  or  authorized agency to the tax commission together with a
  report in such form as may be prescribed by the  tax  commission.    The
  payment  of  the  tax  to  or  through  an exchange, affiliated clearing
  corporation, authorized agency or the tax commission on each transaction
  as hereinbefore provided shall be evidenced by a certification  in  such


 form  and manner as the tax commission may prescribe.  In the event that
  collection of the tax  is  prescribed  without  the  use  of  stamps  as
  hereinbefore  provided,  all  of  the  provisions  of  this  article not
  inconsistent with this section shall apply.

   §  282-a.  Imposition of excise tax on Diesel motor fuel.  1. There is
  hereby levied and imposed with respect to Diesel motor  fuel  an  excise
  tax  of  four cents per gallon upon the sale or use of Diesel motor fuel
  in this state.
    The excise tax is imposed on the first sale or  use  of  Diesel  motor
  fuel to occur which is not exempt from tax under this article. Provided,
  however,  if  the  tax  has  not been imposed prior thereto, it shall be
  imposed on the removal of highway Diesel motor  fuel  from  a  terminal,
  other  than  by pipeline, barge, tanker or other vessel, or the delivery
  of Diesel motor fuel  to  a  filling  station  or  into  the  fuel  tank
  connecting  with  the engine of a motor vehicle for use in the operation
  thereof whichever event shall be  first  to  occur.  The  tax  shall  be
  computed  based  upon  the  number of gallons of Diesel motor fuel sold,
  removed or used or the number of gallons of Diesel fuel  delivered  into
  the  fuel  tank  of a motor vehicle, as the case may be. Nothing in this
  article shall be construed to require the payment  of  such  excise  tax
  more than once upon the same Diesel motor fuel. Nor shall the collection
  of  such  tax be made applicable to the sale or use of Diesel motor fuel
  under circumstances which preclude the collection of such tax by  reason
  of  the  United  States  constitution  and  of laws of the United States
  enacted pursuant thereto. Provided, further, no Diesel motor fuel  shall
  be  included  in  the measure of the tax unless it shall have previously
  come to rest within the meaning of federal decisional  law  interpreting
  the  United  States  constitution.  All  tax  for the period for which a
  return is required to be filed shall be due on the date limited for  the
  filing  of the return for such period, regardless of whether a return is
  filed as required by this article or whether the return which  is  filed
  correctly shows the amount of tax due.
    2.  No  person  shall  sell or use Diesel motor fuel within this state
  (other than a retail sale not in bulk or self-use of Diesel  motor  fuel
  which  has  been  the  subject  of  a  retail sale), import or cause the
  importation of Diesel motor fuel into  the  state  or  produce,  refine,
  manufacture  or  compound Diesel motor fuel within the state unless such
  person shall be registered by the department as a distributor of  Diesel
  motor   fuel.  Provided,  the  commissioner  shall  not  register  as  a
  distributor of Diesel motor fuel any person who is engaged solely in one
  or both of the following: (i) any person who makes or offers to  make  a
  retail  sale  not  in bulk of such fuel or (ii) any person who purchases
  Diesel motor fuel in  bulk  in  this  state  for  the  sole  purpose  of
  self-use.  The  commissioner  may, however, register as a distributor of
  kero-jet fuel only a fixed base operator who makes no sales of  kero-jet
  fuel  other  than  retail  sales not in bulk delivered directly into the
  fuel tank of an airplane for use in the operation of such  airplane  and
  who  makes  no other sales of diesel motor fuel. Such registration shall
  apply only to the wholesale purchase of kero-jet  fuel  and  the  retail
  sale  of  such fuel not in bulk for delivery directly into the fuel tank
  of an airplane for use in the operation thereof. Provided, further, that
  if the commissioner is satisfied that full registration is not necessary
  in order to protect tax revenues, the commissioner may limit  or  modify
  the  requirement  of  registration  as a distributor with respect to any
  person otherwise required to register solely because such person engages
  in the sale of non-highway Diesel motor fuel  where  such  person  makes
  sales  of  non-highway  Diesel motor fuel to the consumer solely for the
  purposes described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b)  of  subdivision
  three  of  this  section, provided that if the commissioner so limits or
  modifies such registration requirement with respect to such person, then
  such  registration  shall  apply  only  to  the  importation,  sale  and
  distribution of such non-highway Diesel motor fuel. The commissioner may


 also  waive  any  other  requirement  imposed  by this article on such a
  distributor. All the provisions of section two hundred  eighty-three  of
  this  article shall apply to applicants for registration and registrants
  with  respect  to Diesel motor fuel, and, in addition, distributors with
  respect to Diesel motor fuel shall be subject to all other provisions of
  this article relating to distributors of motor fuel, including  but  not
  limited  to,  the  keeping  of  records,  the  fixing, determination and
  payment  of  tax  and  filing  of  returns.   Provided,   further,   the
  commissioner  may  limit  or modify the requirement of registration as a
  distributor with respect  to  any  person  who  produces  for  self  use
  "unqualified biodiesel."
    3.  (a) The tax imposed by this section shall not apply to the sale of
  untaxed Diesel motor fuel to or the use of such fuel by an  organization
  described  in  paragraph one or two of subdivision (a) of section eleven
  hundred sixteen of this chapter where such Diesel motor fuel is used  by
  such organization for its own use or consumption.
    (b) The tax on the incidence of sale or use imposed by subdivision one
  of  this  section shall not apply to: (i) the sale or use of non-highway
  Diesel motor fuel, but only if all of such fuel is consumed  other  than
  on  the  public highways of this state (except for the use of the public
  highway by farmers to reach adjacent farmlands); provided, however, this
  exemption shall in no event apply to a sale of non-highway Diesel  motor
  fuel which involves a delivery at a filling station or into a repository
  which  is equipped with a hose or other apparatus by which such fuel can
  be dispensed into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle (except for  delivery
  at  a  farm site which qualifies for the exemption under subdivision (g)
  of section three hundred one-b of this chapter); or (ii) a sale  to  the
  consumer  consisting  of  not  more  than  twenty gallons of water-white
  kerosene to be used and consumed exclusively for  heating  purposes;  or
  (iii)  the  sale  to  or  delivery  at a filling station or other retail
  vendor of water-white kerosene provided such filling  station  or  other
  retail  vendor  only  sells  such  water-white  kerosene exclusively for
  heating purposes in containers of no more than twenty gallons; or (iv) a
  sale of kero-jet fuel to an airline for use in its airplanes or a use of
  kero-jet fuel by an airline in its airplanes; or (v) a sale of  kero-jet
  fuel  by  a  registered distributor of Diesel motor fuel to a fixed base
  operator registered under this article as a distributor of kero-jet fuel
  only where such fixed base operator  is  engaged  solely  in  making  or
  offering to make retail sales not in bulk of kero-jet fuel directly into
  the fuel tank of an airplane for the purpose of operating such airplane;
  or  (vi)  a  retail  sale  not  in bulk of kero-jet fuel by a fixed base
  operator registered under this article as a distributor of kero-jet fuel
  only where such fuel is delivered directly into  the  fuel  tank  of  an
  airplane for use in the operation of such airplane; or (vii) the sale of
  previously untaxed qualified biodiesel to a person registered under this
  article  as  a  distributor of Diesel motor fuel other than (A) a retail
  sale to such person or (B) a  sale  to  such  person  which  involves  a
  delivery  at  a  filling  station or into a repository which is equipped
  with a hose or other apparatus by which such qualified biodiesel can  be
  dispensed  into  the fuel tank of a motor vehicle; or (viii) the sale of
  previously untaxed highway Diesel motor  fuel  by  a  person  registered
  under  this  article  as  a distributor of Diesel motor fuel to a person
  registered under this article as a  distributor  of  Diesel  motor  fuel
  where  the  highway  Diesel motor fuel is either: (A) being delivered by
  pipeline, railcar, barge, tanker or other  vessel  to  a  terminal,  the
  operator  of  which  terminal  is  registered  under section two hundred
  eighty-three-b of this article, or (B) within such a terminal  where  it
  has  been  so delivered. Provided, however, that the exemption set forth


 in this subparagraph shall not apply to any highway Diesel motor fuel if
  it is removed from a terminal, other than by pipeline, barge, tanker  or
  other vessel.
    (c) Nothing in this article shall exempt non-highway diesel motor fuel
  from  the  imposition of the tax under this section, if such non-highway
  diesel motor fuel is intended for use on  the  waterways  of  the  state
  including  any  other  waterways  bordering  on the state, for operating
  pleasure or recreational motor boats thereon.
    4. The tax imposed by this section  on  Diesel  motor  fuel  shall  be
  passed  through  by the seller and included as part of the selling price
  to each purchaser of such fuel. Provided, however, the amount of the tax
  imposed by this section may be excluded from the selling price of Diesel
  motor fuel where (i)  a  sale  of  Diesel  motor  fuel  is  made  to  an
  organization  described  in  paragraph  (a) of subdivision three of this
  section  solely  for  the  purpose  stated  therein;  (ii)  a  sale   of
  non-highway  Diesel  motor  fuel  is made to a consumer but only if such
  non-highway Diesel motor fuel is not delivered to a filling station, nor
  delivered into a storage tank which is equipped with  a  hose  or  other
  apparatus  by  which  such fuel can be dispensed into the fuel tank of a
  motor vehicle; or (iii) the sale to or delivery at a filling station  or
  other  retail  vendor  of  water-white  kerosene  provided  such filling
  station or other retail vendor  only  sells  such  water-white  kerosene
  exclusively  for  heating  purposes in containers of no more than twenty
  gallons; or (iv) a sale of kero-jet fuel is made to an airline  for  use
  in its airplanes.
    5.  All  the provisions of this article relating to the administration
  and collection of the taxes on motor fuel, except  section  two  hundred
  eighty-three-a  of  this article, shall be applicable to the tax imposed
  by this section with such limitation as  specifically  provided  for  in
  this   article   with  respect  to  Diesel  motor  fuel  and  with  such
  modification  as  may  be  necessary  to  adapt  the  language  of  such
  provisions  to the tax imposed by this section. With respect to the bond
  or other security required by subdivision three of section  two  hundred
  eighty-three  of  this  article,  the  commissioner,  in determining the
  amount of bond or other security required for the  purpose  of  securing
  tax  payments,  shall take into account the volume of non-highway Diesel
  motor fuel and other Diesel motor fuel sold for  exempt  purposes  by  a
  distributor  of  Diesel  motor  fuel  during  prior  periods as a factor
  reducing potential tax liability along with any other  relevant  factors
  in determining the amount of security required. With respect to the bond
  required  to  be  filed  prior  to  registration  as a Diesel motor fuel
  distributor, no bond shall be required of an applicant upon a finding of
  the applicant's fiscal responsibility, as reflected by such  factors  as
  net worth, current assets and liabilities, and tax reporting and payment
  history,  and  the  department  shall  not provide for a minimum bond of
  every applicant.

  of  this  article  on  behalf  of  such other person at the time any tax
  imposed under this chapter or any related statute as defined in  section
  eighteen  hundred of this chapter was finally determined to be due, from
  such other person and where such tax has not been paid in  full,  or  at
  the time such other person was convicted of a crime provided for in this
  chapter  or  has  been convicted under the tax laws or penal laws of any
  other state, or a political subdivision of  this  state  or  such  other
  state, or of the United States of a criminal offense which, if committed
  and  prosecuted  in  this  state, would constitute a similar crime under
  this chapter, within the preceding  five  years,  or  at  the  time  the
  registration of such other person was cancelled or suspended pursuant to
  subdivision  four of this section within the preceding five years, or at
  the time such other person committed any of the acts or omissions  which
  are,  or was convicted as, specified in subdivision four of this section
  within the preceding five years, provided, however, where  an  applicant
  or  such  officer,  director,  partner,  shareholder or employee of such
  applicant was  only  an  employee  of  another  person,  the  applicable
  examination of tax payment history of such other person shall be limited
  to  the  taxes  imposed  by  this  article  or by or pursuant to article
  twenty-eight or twenty-nine of this chapter with respect to  motor  fuel
  and  the  applicable  examination of prior criminal convictions shall be
  limited to those which relate to motor fuel,  (f)  the  registration  of
  such  applicant or of an officer, director or partner of such applicant,
  shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than ten percent  of  the
  number  of  shares of stock of such applicant (where such applicant is a
  corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for  the  election  of
  directors  or  trustees,  or  employee  or shareholder of such applicant
  under a duty to file a return under or pursuant to the authority of this
  article or to pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant to the  authority  of
  this article on behalf of such applicant has been cancelled or suspended
  pursuant  to  subdivision four of this section within the preceding five
  years, or (g) the applicant, an officer,  director  or  partner  of  the
  applicant,  a  shareholder  directly  or indirectly owning more than ten
  percent of the number of shares of stock of such applicant  (where  such
  applicant is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for the
  election of directors or trustees, or an employee or shareholder of such
  applicant  under  a  duty  to  file  a  return  under or pursuant to the
  authority of this article or to pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant  to


 the  authority of this article on behalf of the applicant, has committed
  any of the acts or omissions which are, or was convicted  as,  specified
  in subdivision four of this section within the preceding five years, the
  commissioner may refuse to register such applicant.
    3.  The  tax  commission  shall require a distributor to file with the
  department of taxation and finance a bond issued  by  a  surety  company
  approved  by the superintendent of financial services as to solvency and
  responsibility and authorized to transact  business  in  this  state  or
  other  security  acceptable to the tax commission, in such amount as the
  tax commission may fix, in an amount determined in accordance with rules
  and regulations prescribed by it, to secure the payment of any sums  due
  from  such distributor (i) pursuant to this article and (ii) pursuant to
  articles twenty-eight and twenty-nine of this chapter  with  respect  to
  sales and uses of motor fuel. The tax commission shall require that such
  a  bond  or  other security be filed before a distributor is registered,
  and the amount thereof may be increased at any time when in its judgment
  the same is necessary as a protection to the revenues under this article
  and articles twenty-eight and twenty-nine of this chapter. If securities
  are deposited as security under this subdivision, such securities  shall
  be  kept in the joint custody of the comptroller and the commissioner of
  taxation and finance and may be sold by the tax commission if it becomes
  necessary so  to  do  in  order  to  recover  any  sums  due  from  such
  distributor  (i)  pursuant to this article and (ii) pursuant to articles
  twenty-eight and twenty-nine of this chapter with respect to  sales  and
  uses  of  motor  fuel,  but  no  such sale shall be had until after such
  distributor shall have had opportunity to litigate the validity  of  any
  tax if it elects so to do. Upon any such sale the surplus, if any, above
  the  sums  due  (i)  under  this  article  and (ii) pursuant to articles
  twenty-eight and twenty-nine of this chapter with respect to  sales  and
  uses   of  motor  fuel  shall  be  returned  to  such  distributor.  The
  department,  when  authorized  by   the   distributor,   shall   furnish
  information  regarding  the  distributor's  registration  and  any other
  information which the distributor authorizes it to disclose.
    4. The registration of any distributor may be cancelled  or  suspended
  by  the  commissioner  where  a  registrant,  or  an  officer, director,
  shareholder, employee or partner of the registrant who as such  officer,
  director,  shareholder,  employee  or partner is under a duty to act for
  such registrant or any shareholder directly or  indirectly  owning  more
  than  ten  percent  of  the  number of shares of stock of the registrant
  (where such registrant is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to
  vote for the election of directors or trustees of such registrant, fails
  to file a bond or other  security  when  required  or  when  the  amount
  thereof is increased, or fails to continue to maintain in full force and
  effect  at  all times the required bond or other security filed with the
  commissioner, or fails to comply with any  of  the  provisions  of  this
  article  or  article  twenty-eight of this chapter with respect to motor
  fuel or any rule or regulation  adopted  pursuant  to  this  article  or
  article  twenty-eight  of this chapter with respect to motor fuel by the
  department of taxation and finance or by the commissioner, or  knowingly
  aids and abets another person in violating any of the provisions of such
  articles  or  of any such rule or regulation with respect to motor fuel,
  or transfers its registration as a distributor without the prior written
  approval of the commissioner. A registration may also  be  cancelled  or
  suspended  if  the  commissioner  determines  that  a  registrant  or an
  officer, director, shareholder, employee or partner  of  the  registrant
  who as such officer, director, shareholder, employee or partner is under
  a  duty  to  act  for  such  registrant  or  any shareholder directly or
  indirectly owning more than ten percent of the number of shares of stock


 of the registrant (where such registrant is a corporation) entitling the
  holder thereof to vote for the election of directors or trustees of such
  registrant:
    (i)  commits fraud or deceit in his operations as a distributor or has
  committed fraud or deceit in procuring his registration;
    (ii) has been convicted in a court of competent  jurisdiction,  either
  within  or  without  the  state,  of  a  felony,  within  the meaning of
  subdivision eight of this section, bearing on such distributor's  duties
  and obligations under this chapter;
    (iii)  has  knowingly aided and abetted a person who is not registered
  as a distributor in the importation, production,  refining,  manufacture
  or compounding of motor fuel;
    (iv) has impersonated any person represented to be a distributor under
  this article but not in fact registered under this section; or
    (v)  has  knowingly  aided  and abetted the distribution of motor fuel
  imported, caused to be  imported,  produced,  refined,  manufactured  or
  compounded  by  a distributor who is not registered by the department of
  taxation and finance.
    A registration may also be cancelled or suspended if the  commissioner
  determines  that  a  registrant  or  an  officer, director, shareholder,
  employee or partner of the registrant who  as  such  officer,  director,
  shareholder,  employee  or  partner  is  under  a  duty  to act for such
  registrant or any shareholder directly or indirectly  owning  more  than
  ten  percent  of  the number of shares of stock of the registrant (where
  such registrant is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof  to  vote
  for  the  election  of  directors or trustees of such registrant, was an
  officer, director, shareholder, employee or partner  of  another  person
  who  as  such  officer,  director,  shareholder, employee or partner was
  under a duty to act for such other person or was a shareholder  directly
  or  indirectly  owning  more than ten percent of the number of shares of
  stock of such other person (where such other person  is  a  corporation)
  entitling  the  holder  thereof to vote for the election of directors or
  trustees of such other person at the time such  other  person  committed
  any  of  the acts or omissions which are, or was convicted as, specified
  in this subdivision within the preceding five years.
    5. A registration shall not be cancelled or  suspended  nor  shall  an
  application  for  registration  be  refused  unless  the  registrant  or
  applicant has had an opportunity for a hearing, provided, however,  that
  an  application  for registration may be denied without a prior hearing.
  Provided, further, a registration may be cancelled or suspended  without
  a  prior  hearing,  for  failure to file a return within ten days of the
  date prescribed for filing  a  return  under  this  article  or  article
  twenty-eight  of  this  chapter  with respect to sales and uses of motor
  fuel, or for nonpayment of any taxes due pursuant  to  this  article  or
  article  twenty-eight  or  twenty-nine  of  this chapter with respect to
  sales and uses of motor fuel if the registrant shall have failed to file
  such return or pay such taxes within ten days after the date the  demand
  therefor  is  sent by registered or certified mail to the address of the
  distributor given in his application for  registration,  or  an  address
  substituted therefor as provided in this subdivision. A registration may
  be cancelled or suspended prior to a hearing for the failure to continue
  to  maintain  in full force and effect at all times the required bond or
  other security filed with the tax commission. Provided,  however,  if  a
  surety  bond is cancelled prior to expiration, the tax commission, after
  considering  all  the  relevant  circumstances,  may  make  such   other
  arrangements and require the filing of such other bond or other security
  as  it  deems  appropriate.  Provided,  further,  a  registration may be
  cancelled or suspended prior to a  hearing  for  the  transfer  of  such


 registration  without  the  prior  written  approval  of  the  state tax
  commission. A distributor shall immediately inform  the  department,  in
  writing,  of  any  change  in  its  address and, if the distributor is a
  corporation or partnership, the distributor shall immediately inform the
  department,  in  writing,  of  any  change in its officers, directors or
  partners or their residence addresses as shown in  its  application  for
  registration.
    6. (a) A notice of proposed cancellation or suspension of registration
  or  refusal to register shall be given to the person registered pursuant
  to this article or to a person applying for  such  registration  in  the
  manner  prescribed  for  a  notice  of  determination of tax and all the
  provisions of this article applicable to a notice of determination under
  section two hundred eighty-eight of this  chapter,  including,  but  not
  limited  to,  those  provisions  authorizing  the commissioner to make a
  redetermination on the commissioner's  own  motion,  shall  apply  to  a
  notice  issued  pursuant to this subdivision, insofar as such provisions
  can be made applicable to the notice  authorized  by  this  subdivision,
  with  such  modifications  as  may  be  necessary  in order to adapt the
  language  of  such  provisions  to  the  notice   authorized   by   this
  subdivision.  In  the case of a person applying to register, a notice of
  proposed refusal to register shall be issued promptly after  application
  for   registration   is   received  by  the  commissioner.  Upon  timely
  application therefor, a hearing shall be scheduled in  the  division  of
  tax  appeals,  and within three months from such application for hearing
  (determined with regard to any postponements of any scheduled hearing or
  conference or other delay made at the  request  of  the  applicant)  the
  administrative  law  judge shall render a determination either upholding
  the commissioner's refusal to register or ordering the  commissioner  to
  register  the  applicant. Within fifteen days after the giving of notice
  of the administrative law judge's determination, the  applicant  or  the
  commissioner may take exception to the determination. If an exception is
  taken,  the tax appeals tribunal, within seventy-five days from the date
  of  notice  to  the  tribunal  that  exception  is  being  taken  to  an
  administrative  law judge's determination, shall issue a decision either
  affirming or reversing such determination.  If  the  administrative  law
  judge  renders a determination ordering the commissioner to register the
  applicant and the commissioner takes exception  to  such  determination,
  the commissioner shall not be required to register such applicant unless
  and  until  the  tax  appeals  tribunal issues a decision affirming such
  determination. The applicant shall not be  registered  until  there  has
  been  filed a bond or other security in the required amount. Such notice
  of proposed  cancellation  or  suspension  or  of  proposed  refusal  to
  register must be given to such person within five years from the date of
  the  act  or  omission  referred  to  in subdivision two or four of this
  section, except that in the case of acts  involving  falsity  or  fraud,
  such  notice  may be issued at any time. All of such notices of proposed
  cancellation or suspension or of  proposed  refusal  to  register  shall
  contain  a  statement  advising the person to whom it is issued that the
  cancellation, suspension  or  refusal  to  register  may  be  challenged
  through  a hearing process and that the petition for such challenge must
  be filed with the division of tax appeals within ninety days  after  the
  giving  of  such  notice. Where a registration is cancelled or suspended
  prior to a hearing, the cancellation or  suspension  may  be  challenged
  through  the hearing process provided the petition for such challenge is
  filed within ninety days after the giving of notice of such cancellation
  or suspension.
    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary:


   (i) In the event that the commissioner determines that an increase  in
  the  amount  of  the  bond  or  other  security filed by a registrant is
  required to secure the liability of such registrant, such bond  increase
  or  other  security  increase  must  be  filed by such registrant within
  thirty  days  from the day the notice and demand therefor has been given
  by the commissioner. If the registrant fails to (A) file  such  increase
  in  the  amount of bond or other security within such period or (B) make
  timely application for a hearing with particular respect to  the  amount
  of  the  increase of such bond or other security, the commissioner shall
  cancel or suspend the registration of such registrant.
    (ii) The registrant may apply to the division of  tax  appeals  for  a
  hearing  to  review  an  increase  in  the  amount  of the bond or other
  security required to be filed  by  making  application  therefor  within
  seven  days  of  the  day  that the notice and demand for an increase is
  given by the commissioner, provided, the division of tax appeals may, by
  regulation, for the causes stated  therein,  extend  such  period  to  a
  period not exceeding fifteen days from the day such notice and demand is
  given.  If  the  registrant  timely  applies for a hearing to review the
  increase, such hearing shall be held, unless extended by the division of
  tax appeals for good cause, no less than seven days and no more than ten
  days after the application for a hearing is received by the division  of
  tax appeals. Within fifteen days of the receipt of the application for a
  hearing,   unless   extended   by  the  division  of  tax  appeals,  the
  administrative law judge shall render a determination  with  respect  to
  the  increase  in  the  amount of the bond or other security and, if the
  amount of such bond or other security is  determined  to  be  due,  such
  increase   shall   be   filed   within  seven  days  from  the  day  the
  administrative law judge gives  notice  of  the  determination,  or,  if
  later,  thirty  days from the day the notice and demand for the increase
  had been given by the commissioner. Notwithstanding that the  registrant
  takes  exception to the administrative law judge's determination that an
  increased bond or other security is due, if the increased bond or  other
  security is not filed within such time, the commissioner shall cancel or
  suspend the registration of the registrant. Where the administrative law
  judge determines that an increased bond or other security is not due but
  such  determination  is  reversed  by  the  tax appeals tribunal, if the
  increased bond or other security is not filed within seven days from the
  day  the  tax  appeals   tribunal   gives   notice   of   its   decision
  notwithstanding  any judicial review of such decision of the tax appeals
  tribunal, the commissioner shall cancel or suspend the  registration  of
  the registrant.
    7.  Temporary  restraining  order  and  permanent  injunction  against
  unlawful importation and forfeiture of unlawfully imported  or  produced
  motor  fuel  or diesel motor fuel. (a) Whenever evidence is furnished by
  the commissioner to any justice of the supreme court,  in  court  or  at
  chambers,  showing  that  any  person not registered as a distributor as
  required by this article has imported motor fuel or  diesel  motor  fuel
  into this state or caused motor fuel or diesel motor fuel to be imported
  into  this  state  or  has produced, refined, manufactured or compounded
  motor fuel or diesel motor fuel, such justice may make a temporary order
  without notice prohibiting such person  and  his  agents  from  selling,
  transferring  or  otherwise  disposing  of any such fuel or any fuel and
  also prohibiting all other persons in possession of  or  having  control
  over  the  same  from  selling,  releasing,  transferring  or  otherwise
  disposing of any motor fuel or diesel  motor  fuel  imported,  produced,
  refined,  manufactured,  compounded,  sold or transferred by such person
  not so registered pending a hearing for a preliminary injunction.


   (b) Upon granting a temporary order, the court  shall  direct  that  a
  hearing  be  held  at  the  earliest  possible time upon such notice and
  service as the court shall direct and at the same time, if  such  action
  has not yet been commenced, the commissioner shall commence an action in
  supreme court for a permanent injunction and forfeiture of motor fuel or
  diesel  motor fuel pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subdivision. Where,
  after such opportunity for a hearing, the court determines that there is
  a substantial probability that the commissioner  will  prevail  in  such
  action,  the  court shall grant a preliminary injunction restraining the
  sale, release, transfer or other disposition  of  fuel  subject  to  the
  temporary order.
    (c)  (1)  If  it  is established by clear and convincing evidence that
  motor fuel or diesel motor fuel was imported,  caused  to  be  imported,
  produced,   refined,  manufactured  or  compounded  by  any  person  not
  registered as a distributor as required by this article, the court shall
  grant a judgment (i) permanently enjoining such person  and  his  agents
  from  selling,  transferring  or otherwise disposing of any such fuel or
  any fuel within this state and (ii) declaring the forfeiture of any fuel
  that  was  so  imported,  caused  to  be  imported,  produced,  refined,
  manufactured, or compounded by such person.
    (2) With respect to motor fuel or diesel motor fuel that was imported,
  caused to be imported, produced, refined, manufactured or compounded, by
  a  person not registered as a distributor as required by this article or
  that was unlawfully sold  or  transferred  by  such  person,  if  it  is
  established  by  clear  and convincing evidence that any other person in
  possession of or having control over such fuel was not  a  purchaser  or
  transferee in good faith of such fuel with respect to the fact that such
  fuel  was  so  imported,  caused  to  be  imported,  produced,  refined,
  manufactured, or compounded by a person not registered as a  distributor
  as  required by this article or that such fuel was so unlawfully sold or
  transferred by such  person,  the  court  shall  grant  a  judgment  (i)
  permanently  enjoining  such  other  person  and  his or her agents from
  selling, releasing, transferring or otherwise disposing of any such fuel
  and (ii) declaring the forfeiture of such  fuel  in  the  possession  or
  under the control of such other person.
    (d)  The  commissioner  may, at any time subsequent to the granting of
  the temporary order pursuant to paragraph (a) of  this  subdivision,  in
  his  or  her  sole  discretion consent to a sale of motor fuel or diesel
  motor fuel subject to such temporary order which is in the possession or
  under the control of a person other than the person or the agent of  the
  person   who   imported,  caused  to  be  imported,  produced,  refined,
  manufactured, compounded or unlawfully sold or transferred such fuel. As
  a condition of granting permission to a sale of  motor  fuel  or  diesel
  motor  fuel pursuant to this subdivision, the commissioner shall require
  the payment of all taxes, penalties and interest imposed by and pursuant
  to the authority of this chapter with respect to such fuel.
    (e) (1) At any time during  the  pendency  of  an  action  under  this
  section,  the  motor  fuel  or diesel motor fuel subject to a temporary,
  preliminary or permanent order hereunder may be released from the  scope
  of  such  order  if there is given an undertaking, in an amount equal to
  the market value of such fuel plus state  excise  and  sales  taxes  and
  federal  excise  taxes,  to  the  effect  that there will be paid to the
  commissioner the amount of the market value of such fuel and such  taxes
  in the event that such fuel is adjudged forfeited.
    (2)  Any  person  enjoined  by  a  temporary  order  or  a preliminary
  injunction issued pursuant to this subdivision may move at any time,  on
  notice, to vacate or modify it.


   (f)  The  procedures of the civil practice law and rules applicable to
  temporary restraining  orders,  preliminary  injunctions  and  permanent
  injunctions  not  inconsistent  with  this  subdivision  shall  apply to
  temporary orders,  preliminary  injunctions  and  permanent  injunctions
  issued  under  this  subdivision  and  any provision of this subdivision
  which  is  not  in  accord  with  the  constitutional  mandate  of  such
  procedures  of  the  civil  practice law and rules shall be deemed to be
  modified as necessary to accord with  such  a  mandate.  The  procedural
  provisions  set  forth  in  paragraph  three  of  subdivision (d) and in
  subdivision (j) of section eighteen hundred forty-eight of this  chapter
  shall apply to the forfeiture proceedings under this subdivision and, in
  respect to a declaration of forfeiture under this subdivision, the court
  shall  direct  the  commissioner  to  sell  or otherwise dispose of such
  forfeited motor fuel  or  diesel  motor  fuel  on  such  conditions  the
  commissioner  deems  most advantageous and just under the circumstances.
  The commissioner shall not  be  required  to  file  any  undertaking  in
  connection with an action pursuant to this subdivision.
    8.  (a)  For  the purposes of this section, in determining whether any
  person  has  been  convicted  of  a  felony,  the  provisions  of   this
  subdivision  shall  apply;  provided,  however if any such conviction be
  subsequently set aside or reversed upon appeal and the accused acquitted
  or discharged, the registration which has been cancelled or suspended as
  a result of such conviction shall be restored.
    (b) A conviction of a felony shall include the conviction of a  felony
  by  any  court  in this state or by any court of the United States or by
  any court of any other state of the United  States;  provided,  however,
  that  if  a  crime  of  which  a person is convicted by any court of the
  United States or any other state is a  felony  in  the  jurisdiction  in
  which  the  conviction  is  had  but is not a felony in the state of New
  York, then the conviction shall not be deemed a conviction of  a  felony
  for  the  purpose  of this article. In the event that a crime of which a
  person is convicted by any court of the United States or by any court of
  any other state is not  a  felony  in  the  jurisdiction  in  which  the
  conviction  is  had  but  is a felony in the state of New York, then the
  conviction shall be deemed a conviction of a felony for the purposes  of
  this article.
    (c)  If  a person convicted of a felony or crime deemed hereby to be a
  felony is subsequently pardoned by the governor of the state where  such
  conviction  was  had, or by the president of the United States, or shall
  receive a certificate of relief from disabilities or  a  certificate  of
  good  conduct pursuant to article twenty-three of the correction law for
  the purpose of removing the disability under  this  section  because  of
  such   conviction,  the  tax  commission  may,  in  its  discretion,  on
  application of such person and compliance with subdivision two  of  this
  section,  and  on  the submission to it of satisfactory evidence of good
  moral character  and  suitability,  again  register  such  person  as  a
  distributor under this article.
    9.  (a)  The  registration  granted  to a distributor by the state tax
  commission shall be personal to the person to whom it  is  granted.  The
  transfer  of such registration without the prior written approval of the
  state tax commission is invalid and such transfer without approval shall
  be  grounds  for  the  immediate  cancellation  or  suspension  of   the
  registration  of  the  registrant. The tax commission shall establish by
  rule or regulation a specific procedure for the review of an application
  for registration in these instances where  there  has  been  a  proposed
  transfer   of  registration,  and  the  tax  commission  in  making  its
  determination  with  respect  to  such  approval   shall   review   such
  application  in  such instance as any other application for registration


 under this section and shall make its determination in  accordance  with
  the  criteria set forth in this section. Provided further, the state tax
  commission shall issue a determination with respect to such  application
  where  there  has  been  a  proposed  transfer  of  registration  within
  seventy-five days after the day of the receipt of a  properly  completed
  application  containing  such information as the said tax commission may
  require. If the tax commission fails to  issue  a  determination  within
  such  time,  the  tax  commission  shall  be  required  to register such
  proposed transferee.
    (b) For the purposes of this  subdivision,  a  registration  shall  be
  considered  to  be  transferred  where, among other things, there is any
  addition  or  substitution  of  a  partner  of  the  registrant  or  the
  acquisition  by  any  person  of  such shares of stock of the registrant
  (where such registrant is a corporation) so that such person becomes the
  owner of more than ten percent of the number of shares of stock of  such
  registrant  entitling  the  holder  thereof  to vote for the election of
  directors or trustees. Provided, however, where stock of the  registrant
  or  a partnership interest in the registrant or, where the registrant is
  a sole proprietorship, the interest of the decedent therein  along  with
  the  registration,  is transferred pursuant to bequest or inheritance to
  (A) an ancestor of the decedent, (B) the spouse of the decedent,  (C)  a
  lineal  descendent  of the decedent, of the descendent's spouse, or of a
  parent of the decedent, or (D)  the  spouse  of  any  lineal  descendent
  described  in  (C) hereof, such transfer shall not, in and of itself, be
  grounds for cancellation or suspension. Provided, however, within ninety
  days of the death of the decedent in such instance, the registrant,  the
  personal   representative  of  the  decedent's  estate  or  such  person
  described in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C) or (D) of this  paragraph  must
  submit  a  revised  application  for  registration as a distributor. The
  state tax commission may then cancel or suspend the registration because
  of the existence of grounds to do  so  specified  in  this  section  for
  refusal or denial of an application for registration or for cancellation
  or  suspension  of  a  registration.  The  failure  to  submit a revised
  application for registration within such  ninety  day  period  shall  be
  grounds for immediate cancellation or suspension of the registration.
    10.  For  purposes  of  this  section,  where  reference  is  made  to
  ownership, directly or indirectly, of  more  than  ten  percent  of  the
  shares  of stock of the applicant or another person entitling the holder
  thereof to vote for the election of directors or trustees, in  the  case
  of an applicant or another person which at the relevant time has four or
  fewer  shareholders holding shares entitling the holders thereof to vote
  for the election of directors or trustees, twenty-five percent  or  more
  shall  be substituted as the applicable percentage in such references to
  ownership, directly or indirectly, of voting stock.

  case  may  be, under this article except as provided in subdivisions two
  and five of this section. The application shall be in a form and contain
  such data as the department shall prescribe. No person, unless  licensed

  where such motor  fuel  is  being  imported  into  the  state  for  use,
  distribution,  storage  or sale in the state. No person, unless licensed

  where  such  motor  fuel is being exported from a point in this state to
  without this state.

  chapter  or  has  been convicted under the tax laws or penal laws of any
  other state, or a political subdivision of  this  state  or  such  other

  this chapter, within the preceding five years, or an  employee  of  such
  applicant was, in his capacity as a person under a duty to file a return

  imposed by or pursuant to the authority of this article on behalf of any

  imposed  under this chapter or any related statute as defined in section
  eighteen hundred of this chapter was finally determined to be  due  from
  such  other  person  and where such tax has not been paid in full, or at
  the time such other person was convicted of a crime provided for in this
  chapter or has been convicted under the tax laws or penal  laws  of  any

  this chapter, within the preceding five years or at the time the license
  of such other person was cancelled or suspended pursuant to  subdivision

  the preceding five years, provided, however, where an applicant or  such
  officer,  director,  partner,  shareholder or employee of such applicant
  was only an employee of another person, the  applicable  examination  of
  tax  payment  history of such other person shall be limited to the taxes
  imposed by this article or by or pursuant  to  article  twenty-eight  or
  twenty-nine  of  this  chapter  with  respect  to  motor  fuel  and  the
  applicable examination of prior criminal convictions shall be limited to
  those which relate to motor fuel, (f) the license of such  applicant  or
  of  an  officer,  director  or  partner  of  such applicant, shareholder
  directly or indirectly owning more than ten percent  of  the  number  of
  shares   of   stock  of  such  applicant  (where  such  applicant  is  a
  corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for  the  election  of
  directors  or  trustees,  or  employee  or shareholder of such applicant
  under a duty to file a return under or pursuant to the authority of this
  article or to pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant to the  authority  of
  this article on behalf of such applicant has been cancelled or suspended
  pursuant  to  subdivision four of this section within the preceding five
  years, or (g) the applicant, an officer,  director  or  partner  of  the
  applicant,  a  shareholder  directly  or indirectly owning more than ten
  percent of the number of shares of stock of such applicant  (where  such
  applicant is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for the
  election of directors or trustees, or an employee or shareholder of such

 any of the acts or omissions which are, or was convicted  as,  specified
  in subdivision four of this section within the preceding five years, the
  commissioner may refuse to register such applicant.
    3.  The  commissioner  may  require a transporter seeking licensing to
  file with the department a bond issued by a surety company  approved  by
  the   superintendent   of   financial   services   as  to  solvency  and
  responsibility and authorized to transact  business  in  this  state  or
  other  security  acceptable  to  the commissioner, in such amount as the
  commissioner may fix, in an amount determined in accordance  with  rules
  and   regulations   prescribed   by  the  commissioner,  to  secure  the
  performance by such  transporter  of  the  duties  and  responsibilities
  required  (i)  pursuant  to  this  article and (ii) pursuant to articles
  twenty-eight and twenty-nine of this chapter with respect to motor fuel.
  The commissioner may require that such a bond or other security be filed
  before a  transporter  is  licensed,  and  the  amount  thereof  may  be
  increased  at  any  time when in the commissioner's judgment the same is
  necessary.  If  securities  are  deposited  as   security   under   this
  subdivision,  such  securities shall be kept in the joint custody of the
  comptroller and the commissioner and may be sold by the commissioner  if
  it  becomes  necessary  so  to  do  in  order  to  recover  against such
  transporter but no such sale shall be had until after  such  transporter
  shall  have had opportunity to litigate the validity of the liability if
  it elects so to do. Upon any such sale the surplus, if  any,  above  the
  sums  due  shall  be  returned to such transporter. The department, when
  authorized by the transporter, shall furnish information  regarding  the
  transporter's  license  and  any other information which the transporter
  authorizes it to disclose.
    4. The license of  any  importing  or  exporting  transporter  may  be
  cancelled  or  suspended  by  the  commissioner  where a licensee, or an
  officer, director, shareholder, employee or partner of the licensee  who
  as  such  officer, director, shareholder, employee or partner is under a
  duty to act for such licensee or any shareholder directly or  indirectly
  owning  more  than  ten  percent of the number of shares of stock of the
  licensee (where such licensee is a  corporation)  entitling  the  holder
  thereof  to  vote  for  the  election  of  directors or trustees of such
  licensee, fails to file a bond or other security when required  or  when
  the  amount  thereof  is  increased,  or fails to comply with any of the
  provisions of this article or article twenty-eight of this chapter  with
  respect  to  motor  fuel or any rule or regulation with respect to motor
  fuel adopted pursuant to such articles  by  the  department  or  by  the
  commissioner,  or  knowingly  aids and abets another person in violating
  any of the provisions of such articles or of any such rule or regulation
  with respect to motor fuel, or transfers its  license  as  an  importing
  transporter or exporting transporter. A license may also be cancelled or
  suspended  if the commissioner determines that a licensee or an officer,
  director, shareholder, employee or partner of the licensee who  as  such
  officer,  director,  shareholder, employee or partner is under a duty to
  act for such licensee or any shareholder directly or  indirectly  owning
  more  than  ten percent of the number of shares of stock of the licensee
  (where such licensee is a corporation) entitling the holder  thereof  to
  vote for the election of directors or trustees of such licensee:
    (i)  commits fraud or deceit in his operations as a transporter or has
  committed fraud or deceit in procuring his license;
    (ii) has been convicted in a court of competent  jurisdiction,  either
  within  or  without the state, of a felony, as defined under subdivision
  eight of section two hundred eighty-three of this  article,  bearing  on
  such transporter's duties and obligations under this chapter;


   (iii)  has  knowingly aided and abetted a person who is not registered
  as a distributor in the importation, production,  refining,  manufacture
  or compounding of motor fuel; or
    (iv)  has  knowingly  aided and abetted the distribution of motor fuel
  imported, caused to be  imported,  produced,  refined,  manufactured  or
  compounded by a distributor who is not registered by the department.
    A  license  may  also  be  cancelled  or suspended if the commissioner
  determines  that  a  licensee  or  an  officer,  director,  shareholder,
  employee  or  partner  of  the  licensee  who as such officer, director,
  shareholder, employee or partner  is  under  a  duty  to  act  for  such
  licensee  or any shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than ten
  percent of the number of shares of stock of  the  licensee  (where  such
  licensee  is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for the
  election of directors or trustees of  such  licensee,  was  an  officer,
  director, shareholder, employee or partner of another person who as such
  officer,  director, shareholder, employee or partner was under a duty to
  act for such other person or was a shareholder  directly  or  indirectly
  owning  more  than  ten percent of the number of shares of stock of such
  other person (where such other person is a  corporation)  entitling  the
  holder thereof to vote for the election of directors or trustees of such
  other  person at the time such other person committed any of the acts or
  omissions which are, or was convicted as, specified in this  subdivision
  within the preceding five years.
    5.  A  license  shall  not  be  cancelled  or  suspended  nor shall an
  application for a license be refused unless the  licensee  or  applicant
  for  a  license has had an opportunity for a hearing, provided, however,
  that an application for a license may be denied without a prior hearing.
  Provided, further, a license may be cancelled  or  suspended  without  a
  prior hearing, for failure to file a return or report within ten days of
  the  date  prescribed for filing under this article or for nonpayment of
  any sums due  pursuant  to  this  article  or  article  twenty-eight  or
  twenty-nine  of  this chapter with respect to motor fuel if the licensee
  shall have failed to file such return or report or pay such sums  within
  ten  days  after  the  date the demand therefor is sent by registered or
  certified  mail  to  the  address  of  the  transporter  given  in   his
  application for a license, or an address substituted therefor as in this
  subdivision.  A  license  may  also be cancelled or suspended prior to a
  hearing for the failure to continue to maintain in full force and effect
  at all times the bond or other security  filed  with  the  commissioner.
  Provided,  however,  if  a surety bond is cancelled prior to expiration,
  the commissioner, after considering all the relevant circumstances,  may
  make  such  other arrangements and require the filing of such other bond
  or other security  as  the  commissioner  deems  appropriate.  Provided,
  further,  a license may be cancelled or suspended prior to a hearing for
  the transfer of such license. A transporter shall immediately inform the
  department, in writing, of  any  change  in  its  address  and,  if  the
  transporter  is  a  corporation  or  partnership,  the transporter shall
  immediately inform the department, in writing,  of  any  change  in  its
  officers, directors or partners or their residence addresses as shown in
  its application for a license.
    6.  The provisions of subdivisions six, eight, nine and ten of section
  two hundred eighty-three of this article shall apply to  the  provisions
  of this section in the same manner and with the same force and effect as
  if the language of these subdivisions had been incorporated in full into
  this  section  and had expressly referred to the importing transporter's
  license or the  exporting  transporter's  license  under  this  section,
  except to the extent that any such provision is either inconsistent with
  a provision of this section or is not relevant to this section.




   §  283-b.  Licensing  of  terminal  operators.  1.  The  department of
  taxation and finance, upon the application of a person  who  operates  a
  facility  where  motor fuel is deposited, shall license such person as a
  terminal operator under this article except  as  otherwise  provided  in
  this  section.  The  application  shall  be  in  a form and contain such
  information as the department of taxation and finance  shall  prescribe.
  No  person,  unless so licensed, shall operate a terminal, except that a
  person may operate a terminal without a license if all of the motor fuel
  stored in such  facility  is  solely  for  such  person's  own  use  and
  consumption.
    2.  Where  a  person  files  an  application  for a license under this
  section and in considering such application the commissioner  ascertains

  convicted under the tax laws or penal laws of  any  other  state,  or  a
  political  subdivision  of  this  state  or  such other state, or of the

  article, has been convicted of a crime provided for in this  chapter  or
  has  been convicted under the tax laws or penal laws of any other state,

  section  within  the  preceding  five  years,  or at the time such other

  tax  payment  history of such other person shall be limited to the taxes
  imposed by this article or by or pursuant  to  article  twenty-eight  or

  department of taxation and finance a bond issued  by  a  surety  company
  approved  by the superintendent of financial services as to solvency and
  responsibility and authorized to transact  business  in  this  state  or
  other  security  acceptable to the tax commission, in such amount as the
  tax commission may fix, in an amount determined in accordance with rules
  and regulations prescribed by it, to  secure  the  performance  by  such
  terminal  operator  of  the  duties  and  responsibilities  required (i)
  pursuant to this article and (ii) pursuant to articles twenty-eight  and
  twenty-nine  of  this  chapter  with  respect  to  motor  fuel.  The tax
  commission may require that such a  bond  or  other  security  be  filed
  before  a  terminal  operator is licensed, and the amount thereof may be
  increased at any time when in its judgment the  same  is  necessary.  If
  securities  are  deposited  as  security  under  this  subdivision, such
  securities shall be kept in the joint custody of the comptroller and the
  commissioner of taxation  and  finance  and  may  be  sold  by  the  tax


 commission  if it becomes necessary so to do in order to recover against
  such terminal operator but no such sale shall be had  until  after  such
  terminal operator shall have had opportunity to litigate the validity of
  the  liability if it elects so to do. Upon any such sale the surplus, if
  any, above the sums due shall be returned to such terminal operator. The
  department, when authorized by  the  terminal  operator,  shall  furnish
  information  regarding  the  terminal  operator's  license and any other
  information which the terminal operator authorizes it to disclose.
    4. The license of any terminal operator may be cancelled or  suspended
  by   the  commissioner  where  a  licensee,  or  an  officer,  director,
  shareholder, employee or partner of the registrant who as such  officer,
  director,  shareholder,  employee  or partner is under a duty to act for
  such licensee or any shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than
  ten percent of the number of shares of stock of the licensee (where such
  licensee is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for  the
  election of directors or trustees of such licensee, fails to file a bond
  or other security when required or when the amount thereof is increased,
  or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this article or article

  by  the  department  of  taxation and finance or by the commissioner or,
  knowingly aids  and  abets  another  person  in  violating  any  of  the
  provisions  of  such  articles  or  of  any such rule or regulation with
  respect to motor fuel, or transfers its license as a terminal  operator.
  A  license  may  also  be  cancelled  or  suspended  if the commissioner
  determines  that  a  licensee  or  an  officer,  director,  shareholder,

  shareholder, employee or partner  is  under  a  duty  to  act  for  such
  licensee  or any shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than ten

  licensee  is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for the
  election of directors or trustees of such licensee:
    (i) commits fraud or deceit in his operations as a  terminal  operator
  or has committed fraud or deceit in procuring his license;
    (ii)  has  been convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction, either
  within or without  the  state,  of  a  felony,  within  the  meaning  of

  chapter;
    (iii)  has  knowingly aided and abetted a person who is not registered
  as a distributor in the importation, production,  refining,  manufacture
  or compounding of motor fuel; or
    (iv)  has  knowingly  aided and abetted the distribution of motor fuel
  which he has knowledge of as being  imported,  caused  to  be  imported,
  produced,  refined,  manufactured  or compounded by a distributor who is
  not registered by the department of taxation and finance.
    A license may also be  cancelled  or  suspended  if  the  commissioner
  determines  that  a  licensee  or  an  officer,  director,  shareholder,
  employee or partner of the  licensee  who  as  such  officer,  director,
  shareholder,  employee  or  partner  is  under  a  duty  to act for such
  licensee or any shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than  ten
  percent  of  the  number  of shares of stock of the licensee (where such
  licensee is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for  the
  election  of  directors  or  trustees  of such licensee, was an officer,
  director, shareholder, employee or partner of another person who as such
  officer, director, shareholder, employee or partner was under a duty  to
  act  for  such  other person or was a shareholder directly or indirectly
  owning more than ten percent of the number of shares of  stock  of  such


 other  person  (where  such other person is a corporation) entitling the
  holder thereof to vote for the election of directors or trustees of such
  other person at the time such other person committed any of the acts  or
  omissions  which are, or was convicted as, specified in this subdivision
  within the preceding five years.
    5. A license  shall  not  be  cancelled  or  suspended  nor  shall  an
  application  for  a  license be refused unless the licensee or applicant
  for a license has had an opportunity for a hearing,  provided,  however,
  that an application for a license may be denied without a prior hearing.
  Provided,  further,  a  license  may be cancelled or suspended without a
  prior hearing, for failure to file a return or report within ten days of
  the date prescribed for filing under this article or nonpayment  of  any
  sums due pursuant to this article or article twenty-eight or twenty-nine
  of  this  chapter  with respect to motor fuel if the licensee shall have
  failed to file such return or report or pay taxes within ten days  after
  the  date the demand therefor is sent by registered or certified mail to
  the address of the terminal operator given  in  his  application  for  a
  license,  or  an  address substituted therefor as in this subdivision. A
  license may be cancelled or suspended prior to a hearing for the failure
  to continue to maintain in full  force  and  effect  at  all  times  the
  required bond or other security filed with the tax commission. Provided,
  however,  if  a  surety  bond  is cancelled prior to expiration, the tax
  commission, after considering all the relevant circumstances,  may  make
  such  other  arrangements  and  require the filing of such other bond or
  other security as it deems appropriate. Provided, further, a license may
  be cancelled or suspended prior to a hearing for the  transfer  of  such
  license. A terminal operator shall immediately inform the department, in
  writing, of any change in its address and, if the terminal operator is a
  corporation  or  partnership,  the  terminal  operator shall immediately
  inform the department, in  writing,  of  any  change  in  its  officers,
  directors  or  partners  or  their  residence  addresses as shown in its
  application for a license.
    6. The provisions of subdivisions six, eight, nine and ten of  section
  two  hundred  eighty-three of this article shall apply to the provisions
  of this section in the same manner and with the same force and effect as
  if the language of these subdivisions had been incorporated in full into
  this section and had  expressly  referred  to  the  terminal  operator's
  license under this section, except to the extent that any such provision
  is  either  inconsistent  with  a  provision  of  this section or is not
  relevant to this section.

  finance, upon the application of a person, shall register such person as
  a  distributor under this article except as provided in subdivisions two

  the  state  cannot  impose such condition by reason of the United States
  constitution and of laws of the United States enacted pursuant thereto.
    2. Where a person files an application  for  registration  under  this

  years, (d)  an  officer,  director  or  partner  of  such  applicant,  a

 person, convicted of a crime provided for in this chapter  or  has  been
  convicted  under  the  tax  laws  or penal laws of any other state, or a
  political subdivision of this state or  such  other  state,  or  of  the
  United  States  of a criminal offense which, if committed and prosecuted
  in this state, would constitute a  similar  crime  under  this  chapter,
  within  the  preceding  five  years,  (e) such applicant, or an officer,
  director  or  partner  of  such  applicant,  shareholder   directly   or
  indirectly owning more than ten percent of the number of shares of stock
  of  such applicant (where such applicant is a corporation) entitling the
  holder thereof to vote for the election of  directors  or  trustees,  or
  employee  or shareholder of such applicant under a duty to file a return
  under or pursuant to the authority of this article or to pay  the  taxes
  imposed  by  or  pursuant  to the authority of this article on behalf of
  such applicant, who was an  officer,  director  or  partner  of  another
  person, or who directly or indirectly owned more than ten percent of the
  number  of shares of stock of another person (where such other person is
  a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for the election  of

  person under a duty to file a return under or pursuant to the  authority
  of this article or pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant to the authority
  of  this  article  on  behalf  of  such other person at the time any tax
  imposed under this chapter or any related statute as defined in  section
  eighteen  hundred of this chapter was finally determined to be due, from
  such other person and where such tax has not been paid in  full,  or  at
  the time such other person was convicted of a crime provided for in this
  chapter  or  has  been convicted under the tax laws or penal laws of any
  other state, or a political subdivision of  this  state  or  such  other

  this chapter, within the preceding  five  years,  or  at  the  time  the
  registration of such other person was cancelled or suspended pursuant to
  subdivision  four of this section within the preceding five years, or at
  the time such other person committed any of the acts or omissions  which

  within the preceding five years, provided, however, where  an  applicant
  or  such  officer,  director,  partner,  shareholder or employee of such
  applicant was  only  an  employee  of  another  person,  the  applicable
  examination of tax payment history of such other person shall be limited
  to  the  taxes  imposed  by  this  article  or by or pursuant to article
  twenty-eight or twenty-nine of this chapter with respect to  motor  fuel
  and  the  applicable  examination of prior criminal convictions shall be
  limited to those which relate to motor fuel,  (f)  the  registration  of
  such  applicant or of an officer, director or partner of such applicant,
  shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than ten percent  of  the
  number  of  shares of stock of such applicant (where such applicant is a
  corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for  the  election  of
  directors  or  trustees,  or  employee  or shareholder of such applicant
  under a duty to file a return under or pursuant to the authority of this
  article or to pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant to the  authority  of
  this article on behalf of such applicant has been cancelled or suspended
  pursuant  to  subdivision four of this section within the preceding five
  years, or (g) the applicant, an officer,  director  or  partner  of  the
  applicant,  a  shareholder  directly  or indirectly owning more than ten
  percent of the number of shares of stock of such applicant  (where  such
  applicant is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for the
  election of directors or trustees, or an employee or shareholder of such
  applicant  under  a  duty  to  file  a  return  under or pursuant to the

 the  authority of this article on behalf of the applicant, has committed
  any of the acts or omissions which are, or was convicted  as,  specified
  in subdivision four of this section within the preceding five years, the
  commissioner may refuse to register such applicant.
    3.  The  tax  commission  shall require a distributor to file with the
  department of taxation and finance a bond issued  by  a  surety  company
  approved  by the superintendent of financial services as to solvency and
  responsibility and authorized to transact  business  in  this  state  or
  other  security  acceptable to the tax commission, in such amount as the
  tax commission may fix, in an amount determined in accordance with rules
  and regulations prescribed by it, to secure the payment of any sums  due
  from  such distributor (i) pursuant to this article and (ii) pursuant to
  articles twenty-eight and twenty-nine of this chapter  with  respect  to
  sales and uses of motor fuel. The tax commission shall require that such
  a  bond  or  other security be filed before a distributor is registered,
  and the amount thereof may be increased at any time when in its judgment
  the same is necessary as a protection to the revenues under this article
  and articles twenty-eight and twenty-nine of this chapter. If securities
  are deposited as security under this subdivision, such securities  shall
  be  kept in the joint custody of the comptroller and the commissioner of
  taxation and finance and may be sold by the tax commission if it becomes
  necessary so  to  do  in  order  to  recover  any  sums  due  from  such
  distributor  (i)  pursuant to this article and (ii) pursuant to articles
  twenty-eight and twenty-nine of this chapter with respect to  sales  and
  uses  of  motor  fuel,  but  no  such sale shall be had until after such
  distributor shall have had opportunity to litigate the validity  of  any
  tax if it elects so to do. Upon any such sale the surplus, if any, above
  the  sums  due  (i)  under  this  article  and (ii) pursuant to articles
  twenty-eight and twenty-nine of this chapter with respect to  sales  and
  uses   of  motor  fuel  shall  be  returned  to  such  distributor.  The
  department,  when  authorized  by   the   distributor,   shall   furnish
  information  regarding  the  distributor's  registration  and  any other
  information which the distributor authorizes it to disclose.
    4. The registration of any distributor may be cancelled  or  suspended
  by  the  commissioner  where  a  registrant,  or  an  officer, director,
  shareholder, employee or partner of the registrant who as such  officer,
  director,  shareholder,  employee  or partner is under a duty to act for
  such registrant or any shareholder directly or  indirectly  owning  more
  than  ten  percent  of  the  number of shares of stock of the registrant
  (where such registrant is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to
  vote for the election of directors or trustees of such registrant, fails
  to file a bond or other  security  when  required  or  when  the  amount
  thereof is increased, or fails to continue to maintain in full force and
  effect  at  all times the required bond or other security filed with the
  commissioner, or fails to comply with any  of  the  provisions  of  this
  article  or  article  twenty-eight of this chapter with respect to motor
  fuel or any rule or regulation  adopted  pursuant  to  this  article  or
  article  twenty-eight  of this chapter with respect to motor fuel by the
  department of taxation and finance or by the commissioner, or  knowingly
  aids and abets another person in violating any of the provisions of such
  articles  or  of any such rule or regulation with respect to motor fuel,
  or transfers its registration as a distributor without the prior written
  approval of the commissioner. A registration may also  be  cancelled  or
  suspended  if  the  commissioner  determines  that  a  registrant  or an
  officer, director, shareholder, employee or partner  of  the  registrant
  who as such officer, director, shareholder, employee or partner is under
  a  duty  to  act  for  such  registrant  or  any shareholder directly or
  indirectly owning more than ten percent of the number of shares of stock


 of the registrant (where such registrant is a corporation) entitling the
  holder thereof to vote for the election of directors or trustees of such
  registrant:
    (i)  commits fraud or deceit in his operations as a distributor or has
  committed fraud or deceit in procuring his registration;
    (ii) has been convicted in a court of competent  jurisdiction,  either
  within  or  without  the  state,  of  a  felony,  within  the meaning of
  subdivision eight of this section, bearing on such distributor's  duties
  and obligations under this chapter;
    (iii)  has  knowingly aided and abetted a person who is not registered
  as a distributor in the importation, production,  refining,  manufacture
  or compounding of motor fuel;
    (iv) has impersonated any person represented to be a distributor under
  this article but not in fact registered under this section; or
    (v)  has  knowingly  aided  and abetted the distribution of motor fuel
  imported, caused to be  imported,  produced,  refined,  manufactured  or
  compounded  by  a distributor who is not registered by the department of
  taxation and finance.
    A registration may also be cancelled or suspended if the  commissioner
  determines  that  a  registrant  or  an  officer, director, shareholder,
  employee or partner of the registrant who  as  such  officer,  director,
  shareholder,  employee  or  partner  is  under  a  duty  to act for such
  registrant or any shareholder directly or indirectly  owning  more  than
  ten  percent  of  the number of shares of stock of the registrant (where
  such registrant is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof  to  vote
  for  the  election  of  directors or trustees of such registrant, was an
  officer, director, shareholder, employee or partner  of  another  person
  who  as  such  officer,  director,  shareholder, employee or partner was
  under a duty to act for such other person or was a shareholder  directly
  or  indirectly  owning  more than ten percent of the number of shares of
  stock of such other person (where such other person  is  a  corporation)
  entitling  the  holder  thereof to vote for the election of directors or
  trustees of such other person at the time such  other  person  committed
  any  of  the acts or omissions which are, or was convicted as, specified
  in this subdivision within the preceding five years.
    5. A registration shall not be cancelled or  suspended  nor  shall  an
  application  for  registration  be  refused  unless  the  registrant  or
  applicant has had an opportunity for a hearing, provided, however,  that
  an  application  for registration may be denied without a prior hearing.
  Provided, further, a registration may be cancelled or suspended  without
  a  prior  hearing,  for  failure to file a return within ten days of the
  date prescribed for filing  a  return  under  this  article  or  article
  twenty-eight  of  this  chapter  with respect to sales and uses of motor
  fuel, or for nonpayment of any taxes due pursuant  to  this  article  or
  article  twenty-eight  or  twenty-nine  of  this chapter with respect to
  sales and uses of motor fuel if the registrant shall have failed to file
  such return or pay such taxes within ten days after the date the  demand
  therefor  is  sent by registered or certified mail to the address of the
  distributor given in his application for  registration,  or  an  address
  substituted therefor as provided in this subdivision. A registration may
  be cancelled or suspended prior to a hearing for the failure to continue
  to  maintain  in full force and effect at all times the required bond or
  other security filed with the tax commission. Provided,  however,  if  a
  surety  bond is cancelled prior to expiration, the tax commission, after
  considering  all  the  relevant  circumstances,  may  make  such   other
  arrangements and require the filing of such other bond or other security
  as  it  deems  appropriate.  Provided,  further,  a  registration may be
  cancelled or suspended prior to a  hearing  for  the  transfer  of  such


 registration  without  the  prior  written  approval  of  the  state tax
  commission. A distributor shall immediately inform  the  department,  in
  writing,  of  any  change  in  its  address and, if the distributor is a
  corporation or partnership, the distributor shall immediately inform the
  department,  in  writing,  of  any  change in its officers, directors or
  partners or their residence addresses as shown in  its  application  for
  registration.
    6. (a) A notice of proposed cancellation or suspension of registration
  or  refusal to register shall be given to the person registered pursuant
  to this article or to a person applying for  such  registration  in  the
  manner  prescribed  for  a  notice  of  determination of tax and all the
  provisions of this article applicable to a notice of determination under
  section two hundred eighty-eight of this  chapter,  including,  but  not
  limited  to,  those  provisions  authorizing  the commissioner to make a
  redetermination on the commissioner's  own  motion,  shall  apply  to  a
  notice  issued  pursuant to this subdivision, insofar as such provisions
  can be made applicable to the notice  authorized  by  this  subdivision,
  with  such  modifications  as  may  be  necessary  in order to adapt the
  language  of  such  provisions  to  the  notice   authorized   by   this
  subdivision.  In  the case of a person applying to register, a notice of
  proposed refusal to register shall be issued promptly after  application
  for   registration   is   received  by  the  commissioner.  Upon  timely
  application therefor, a hearing shall be scheduled in  the  division  of
  tax  appeals,  and within three months from such application for hearing
  (determined with regard to any postponements of any scheduled hearing or
  conference or other delay made at the  request  of  the  applicant)  the
  administrative  law  judge shall render a determination either upholding
  the commissioner's refusal to register or ordering the  commissioner  to
  register  the  applicant. Within fifteen days after the giving of notice
  of the administrative law judge's determination, the  applicant  or  the
  commissioner may take exception to the determination. If an exception is
  taken,  the tax appeals tribunal, within seventy-five days from the date
  of  notice  to  the  tribunal  that  exception  is  being  taken  to  an
  administrative  law judge's determination, shall issue a decision either
  affirming or reversing such determination.  If  the  administrative  law
  judge  renders a determination ordering the commissioner to register the
  applicant and the commissioner takes exception  to  such  determination,
  the commissioner shall not be required to register such applicant unless
  and  until  the  tax  appeals  tribunal issues a decision affirming such
  determination. The applicant shall not be  registered  until  there  has
  been  filed a bond or other security in the required amount. Such notice
  of proposed  cancellation  or  suspension  or  of  proposed  refusal  to
  register must be given to such person within five years from the date of
  the  act  or  omission  referred  to  in subdivision two or four of this
  section, except that in the case of acts  involving  falsity  or  fraud,
  such  notice  may be issued at any time. All of such notices of proposed
  cancellation or suspension or of  proposed  refusal  to  register  shall
  contain  a  statement  advising the person to whom it is issued that the
  cancellation, suspension  or  refusal  to  register  may  be  challenged
  through  a hearing process and that the petition for such challenge must
  be filed with the division of tax appeals within ninety days  after  the
  giving  of  such  notice. Where a registration is cancelled or suspended
  prior to a hearing, the cancellation or  suspension  may  be  challenged
  through  the hearing process provided the petition for such challenge is
  filed within ninety days after the giving of notice of such cancellation
  or suspension.
    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary:


   (i) In the event that the commissioner determines that an increase  in
  the  amount  of  the  bond  or  other  security filed by a registrant is
  required to secure the liability of such registrant, such bond  increase
  or  other  security  increase  must  be  filed by such registrant within
  thirty  days  from the day the notice and demand therefor has been given
  by the commissioner. If the registrant fails to (A) file  such  increase
  in  the  amount of bond or other security within such period or (B) make
  timely application for a hearing with particular respect to  the  amount
  of  the  increase of such bond or other security, the commissioner shall
  cancel or suspend the registration of such registrant.
    (ii) The registrant may apply to the division of  tax  appeals  for  a
  hearing  to  review  an  increase  in  the  amount  of the bond or other
  security required to be filed  by  making  application  therefor  within
  seven  days  of  the  day  that the notice and demand for an increase is
  given by the commissioner, provided, the division of tax appeals may, by
  regulation, for the causes stated  therein,  extend  such  period  to  a
  period not exceeding fifteen days from the day such notice and demand is
  given.  If  the  registrant  timely  applies for a hearing to review the
  increase, such hearing shall be held, unless extended by the division of
  tax appeals for good cause, no less than seven days and no more than ten
  days after the application for a hearing is received by the division  of
  tax appeals. Within fifteen days of the receipt of the application for a
  hearing,   unless   extended   by  the  division  of  tax  appeals,  the
  administrative law judge shall render a determination  with  respect  to
  the  increase  in  the  amount of the bond or other security and, if the
  amount of such bond or other security is  determined  to  be  due,  such
  increase   shall   be   filed   within  seven  days  from  the  day  the
  administrative law judge gives  notice  of  the  determination,  or,  if
  later,  thirty  days from the day the notice and demand for the increase
  had been given by the commissioner. Notwithstanding that the  registrant
  takes  exception to the administrative law judge's determination that an
  increased bond or other security is due, if the increased bond or  other
  security is not filed within such time, the commissioner shall cancel or
  suspend the registration of the registrant. Where the administrative law
  judge determines that an increased bond or other security is not due but
  such  determination  is  reversed  by  the  tax appeals tribunal, if the
  increased bond or other security is not filed within seven days from the
  day  the  tax  appeals   tribunal   gives   notice   of   its   decision
  notwithstanding  any judicial review of such decision of the tax appeals
  tribunal, the commissioner shall cancel or suspend the  registration  of
  the registrant.
    7.  Temporary  restraining  order  and  permanent  injunction  against
  unlawful importation and forfeiture of unlawfully imported  or  produced
  motor  fuel  or diesel motor fuel. (a) Whenever evidence is furnished by
  the commissioner to any justice of the supreme court,  in  court  or  at
  chambers,  showing  that  any  person not registered as a distributor as
  required by this article has imported motor fuel or  diesel  motor  fuel
  into this state or caused motor fuel or diesel motor fuel to be imported
  into  this  state  or  has produced, refined, manufactured or compounded
  motor fuel or diesel motor fuel, such justice may make a temporary order
  without notice prohibiting such person  and  his  agents  from  selling,
  transferring  or  otherwise  disposing  of any such fuel or any fuel and
  also prohibiting all other persons in possession of  or  having  control
  over  the  same  from  selling,  releasing,  transferring  or  otherwise
  disposing of any motor fuel or diesel  motor  fuel  imported,  produced,
  refined,  manufactured,  compounded,  sold or transferred by such person
  not so registered pending a hearing for a preliminary injunction.


   (b) Upon granting a temporary order, the court  shall  direct  that  a
  hearing  be  held  at  the  earliest  possible time upon such notice and
  service as the court shall direct and at the same time, if  such  action
  has not yet been commenced, the commissioner shall commence an action in
  supreme court for a permanent injunction and forfeiture of motor fuel or
  diesel  motor fuel pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subdivision. Where,
  after such opportunity for a hearing, the court determines that there is
  a substantial probability that the commissioner  will  prevail  in  such
  action,  the  court shall grant a preliminary injunction restraining the
  sale, release, transfer or other disposition  of  fuel  subject  to  the
  temporary order.
    (c)  (1)  If  it  is established by clear and convincing evidence that
  motor fuel or diesel motor fuel was imported,  caused  to  be  imported,
  produced,   refined,  manufactured  or  compounded  by  any  person  not
  registered as a distributor as required by this article, the court shall
  grant a judgment (i) permanently enjoining such person  and  his  agents
  from  selling,  transferring  or otherwise disposing of any such fuel or
  any fuel within this state and (ii) declaring the forfeiture of any fuel
  that  was  so  imported,  caused  to  be  imported,  produced,  refined,
  manufactured, or compounded by such person.
    (2) With respect to motor fuel or diesel motor fuel that was imported,
  caused to be imported, produced, refined, manufactured or compounded, by
  a  person not registered as a distributor as required by this article or
  that was unlawfully sold  or  transferred  by  such  person,  if  it  is
  established  by  clear  and convincing evidence that any other person in
  possession of or having control over such fuel was not  a  purchaser  or
  transferee in good faith of such fuel with respect to the fact that such
  fuel  was  so  imported,  caused  to  be  imported,  produced,  refined,
  manufactured, or compounded by a person not registered as a  distributor
  as  required by this article or that such fuel was so unlawfully sold or
  transferred by such  person,  the  court  shall  grant  a  judgment  (i)
  permanently  enjoining  such  other  person  and  his or her agents from
  selling, releasing, transferring or otherwise disposing of any such fuel
  and (ii) declaring the forfeiture of such  fuel  in  the  possession  or
  under the control of such other person.
    (d)  The  commissioner  may, at any time subsequent to the granting of
  the temporary order pursuant to paragraph (a) of  this  subdivision,  in
  his  or  her  sole  discretion consent to a sale of motor fuel or diesel
  motor fuel subject to such temporary order which is in the possession or
  under the control of a person other than the person or the agent of  the
  person   who   imported,  caused  to  be  imported,  produced,  refined,
  manufactured, compounded or unlawfully sold or transferred such fuel. As
  a condition of granting permission to a sale of  motor  fuel  or  diesel
  motor  fuel pursuant to this subdivision, the commissioner shall require
  the payment of all taxes, penalties and interest imposed by and pursuant
  to the authority of this chapter with respect to such fuel.
    (e) (1) At any time during  the  pendency  of  an  action  under  this
  section,  the  motor  fuel  or diesel motor fuel subject to a temporary,
  preliminary or permanent order hereunder may be released from the  scope
  of  such  order  if there is given an undertaking, in an amount equal to
  the market value of such fuel plus state  excise  and  sales  taxes  and
  federal  excise  taxes,  to  the  effect  that there will be paid to the
  commissioner the amount of the market value of such fuel and such  taxes
  in the event that such fuel is adjudged forfeited.
    (2)  Any  person  enjoined  by  a  temporary  order  or  a preliminary
  injunction issued pursuant to this subdivision may move at any time,  on
  notice, to vacate or modify it.


   (f)  The  procedures of the civil practice law and rules applicable to
  temporary restraining  orders,  preliminary  injunctions  and  permanent
  injunctions  not  inconsistent  with  this  subdivision  shall  apply to
  temporary orders,  preliminary  injunctions  and  permanent  injunctions
  issued  under  this  subdivision  and  any provision of this subdivision
  which  is  not  in  accord  with  the  constitutional  mandate  of  such
  procedures  of  the  civil  practice law and rules shall be deemed to be
  modified as necessary to accord with  such  a  mandate.  The  procedural
  provisions  set  forth  in  paragraph  three  of  subdivision (d) and in
  subdivision (j) of section eighteen hundred forty-eight of this  chapter
  shall apply to the forfeiture proceedings under this subdivision and, in
  respect to a declaration of forfeiture under this subdivision, the court
  shall  direct  the  commissioner  to  sell  or otherwise dispose of such
  forfeited motor fuel  or  diesel  motor  fuel  on  such  conditions  the
  commissioner  deems  most advantageous and just under the circumstances.
  The commissioner shall not  be  required  to  file  any  undertaking  in
  connection with an action pursuant to this subdivision.
    8.  (a)  For  the purposes of this section, in determining whether any
  person  has  been  convicted  of  a  felony,  the  provisions  of   this
  subdivision  shall  apply;  provided,  however if any such conviction be
  subsequently set aside or reversed upon appeal and the accused acquitted
  or discharged, the registration which has been cancelled or suspended as
  a result of such conviction shall be restored.
    (b) A conviction of a felony shall include the conviction of a  felony
  by  any  court  in this state or by any court of the United States or by
  any court of any other state of the United  States;  provided,  however,
  that  if  a  crime  of  which  a person is convicted by any court of the
  United States or any other state is a  felony  in  the  jurisdiction  in
  which  the  conviction  is  had  but is not a felony in the state of New
  York, then the conviction shall not be deemed a conviction of  a  felony
  for  the  purpose  of this article. In the event that a crime of which a
  person is convicted by any court of the United States or by any court of
  any other state is not  a  felony  in  the  jurisdiction  in  which  the
  conviction  is  had  but  is a felony in the state of New York, then the
  conviction shall be deemed a conviction of a felony for the purposes  of
  this article.
    (c)  If  a person convicted of a felony or crime deemed hereby to be a
  felony is subsequently pardoned by the governor of the state where  such
  conviction  was  had, or by the president of the United States, or shall
  receive a certificate of relief from disabilities or  a  certificate  of
  good  conduct pursuant to article twenty-three of the correction law for
  the purpose of removing the disability under  this  section  because  of
  such   conviction,  the  tax  commission  may,  in  its  discretion,  on
  application of such person and compliance with subdivision two  of  this
  section,  and  on  the submission to it of satisfactory evidence of good
  moral character  and  suitability,  again  register  such  person  as  a
  distributor under this article.
    9.  (a)  The  registration  granted  to a distributor by the state tax
  commission shall be personal to the person to whom it  is  granted.  The
  transfer  of such registration without the prior written approval of the
  state tax commission is invalid and such transfer without approval shall
  be  grounds  for  the  immediate  cancellation  or  suspension  of   the
  registration  of  the  registrant. The tax commission shall establish by
  rule or regulation a specific procedure for the review of an application
  for registration in these instances where  there  has  been  a  proposed
  transfer   of  registration,  and  the  tax  commission  in  making  its
  determination  with  respect  to  such  approval   shall   review   such
  application  in  such instance as any other application for registration


 under this section and shall make its determination in  accordance  with
  the  criteria set forth in this section. Provided further, the state tax
  commission shall issue a determination with respect to such  application
  where  there  has  been  a  proposed  transfer  of  registration  within
  seventy-five days after the day of the receipt of a  properly  completed
  application  containing  such information as the said tax commission may
  require. If the tax commission fails to  issue  a  determination  within
  such  time,  the  tax  commission  shall  be  required  to register such
  proposed transferee.
    (b) For the purposes of this  subdivision,  a  registration  shall  be
  considered  to  be  transferred  where, among other things, there is any
  addition  or  substitution  of  a  partner  of  the  registrant  or  the
  acquisition  by  any  person  of  such shares of stock of the registrant
  (where such registrant is a corporation) so that such person becomes the
  owner of more than ten percent of the number of shares of stock of  such
  registrant  entitling  the  holder  thereof  to vote for the election of
  directors or trustees. Provided, however, where stock of the  registrant
  or  a partnership interest in the registrant or, where the registrant is
  a sole proprietorship, the interest of the decedent therein  along  with
  the  registration,  is transferred pursuant to bequest or inheritance to
  (A) an ancestor of the decedent, (B) the spouse of the decedent,  (C)  a
  lineal  descendent  of the decedent, of the descendent's spouse, or of a
  parent of the decedent, or (D)  the  spouse  of  any  lineal  descendent
  described  in  (C) hereof, such transfer shall not, in and of itself, be
  grounds for cancellation or suspension. Provided, however, within ninety
  days of the death of the decedent in such instance, the registrant,  the
  personal   representative  of  the  decedent's  estate  or  such  person
  described in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C) or (D) of this  paragraph  must
  submit  a  revised  application  for  registration as a distributor. The
  state tax commission may then cancel or suspend the registration because
  of the existence of grounds to do  so  specified  in  this  section  for
  refusal or denial of an application for registration or for cancellation
  or  suspension  of  a  registration.  The  failure  to  submit a revised
  application for registration within such  ninety  day  period  shall  be
  grounds for immediate cancellation or suspension of the registration.
    10.  For  purposes  of  this  section,  where  reference  is  made  to
  ownership, directly or indirectly, of  more  than  ten  percent  of  the
  shares  of stock of the applicant or another person entitling the holder
  thereof to vote for the election of directors or trustees, in  the  case
  of an applicant or another person which at the relevant time has four or
  fewer  shareholders holding shares entitling the holders thereof to vote
  for the election of directors or trustees, twenty-five percent  or  more
  shall  be substituted as the applicable percentage in such references to
  ownership, directly or indirectly, of voting stock.




   §  283-a. Licensing of importing transporters. 1. The department, upon
  the application of a person who transports  motor  fuel,  shall  license
  such person as an importing transporter or exporting transporter, as the
  case  may  be, under this article except as provided in subdivisions two
  and five of this section. The application shall be in a form and contain
  such data as the department shall prescribe. No person, unless  licensed
  as  an  importing  transporter,  shall transport motor fuel in the state
  where such motor  fuel  is  being  imported  into  the  state  for  use,
  distribution,  storage  or sale in the state. No person, unless licensed
  as an exporting transporter, shall transport motor fuel  in  this  state
  where  such  motor  fuel is being exported from a point in this state to
  without this state.
    2. Where a person  files  an  application  for  licensing  under  this
  section  and in considering such application the commissioner ascertains
  that (a) any tax imposed under this chapter or any  related  statute  as
  defined  in  section  eighteen  hundred of this chapter has been finally
  determined to be due from such applicant or from any  officer,  director
  or  partner of such applicant, shareholder directly or indirectly owning
  more than ten percent of the number of shares of stock of such applicant
  (where such applicant is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof  to
  vote  for  the  election of directors or trustees, or any shareholder or
  employee of such applicant under a  duty  to  file  a  return  under  or
  pursuant to the authority of this article or pay the taxes imposed by or
  pursuant  to  the authority of this article on behalf of such applicant,
  and has not been paid in full, (b) a liability for the penalty  provided
  for  under  subdivision two of section two hundred eighty-nine-b of this
  article has been finally determined to be due from an officer, director,
  shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than ten percent  of  the
  number  of  shares of stock of such applicant (where such applicant is a
  corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for  the  election  of
  directors  or  trustees,  employee  or  partner  of  such applicant or a
  shareholder of such applicant under a duty to file  a  return  under  or
  pursuant to the authority of this article or pay the taxes imposed by or
  pursuant  to  the authority of this article on behalf of such applicant,
  and has not been paid in full, (c) such applicant has been convicted  of
  a crime provided for in this chapter or has been convicted under the tax
  laws  or  penal  laws  of any other state, or a political subdivision of
  this state or such other state, or of the United States  of  a  criminal
  offense  which,  if  committed  and  prosecuted  in  this  state,  would
  constitute a similar crime under this chapter, within the preceding five
  years, (d)  an  officer,  director  or  partner  of  such  applicant,  a
  shareholder  directly  or indirectly owning more than ten percent of the
  number of shares of stock of such applicant (where such applicant  is  a
  corporation)  entitling  the  holder thereof to vote for the election of
  directors or trustees, or an employee or shareholder of  such  applicant
  who,  as  such employee or shareholder, is under a duty to file a return
  under or pursuant to the authority of this  article  or  pay  the  taxes
  imposed  by  or  pursuant  to the authority of this article on behalf of
  such applicant, has been convicted of  a  crime  provided  for  in  this
  chapter  or  has  been convicted under the tax laws or penal laws of any
  other state, or a political subdivision of  this  state  or  such  other
  state, or of the United States of a criminal offense which, if committed
  and  prosecuted  in  this  state, would constitute a similar crime under
  this chapter, within the preceding five years, or an  employee  of  such
  applicant was, in his capacity as a person under a duty to file a return
  under  or  pursuant  to  the  authority of this article or pay the taxes
  imposed by or pursuant to the authority of this article on behalf of any
  person, convicted of a crime provided for in this chapter  or  has  been


 convicted  under  the  tax  laws  or penal laws of any other state, or a
  political subdivision of this state or  such  other  state,  or  of  the
  United  States  of a criminal offense which, if committed and prosecuted
  in  this  state,  would  constitute  a similar crime under this chapter,
  within the preceding five years, (e)  such  applicant,  or  an  officer,
  director   or   partner  of  such  applicant,  shareholder  directly  or
  indirectly owning more than ten percent of the number of shares of stock
  of such applicant (where such applicant is a corporation) entitling  the
  holder  thereof  to  vote  for the election of directors or trustees, or
  employee or shareholder of such applicant under a duty to file a  return
  under  or  pursuant to the authority of this article or to pay the taxes
  imposed by or pursuant to the authority of this  article  on  behalf  of
  such  applicant,  who  was  an  officer,  director or partner of another
  person, or who directly or indirectly owned more than ten percent of the
  number of shares of stock of another person (where such other person  is
  a  corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for the election of
  directors or trustees, or who was an employee or shareholder of  another
  person  under a duty to file a return under or pursuant to the authority
  of this article or pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant to the authority
  of this article on behalf of such other  person  at  the  time  any  tax
  imposed  under this chapter or any related statute as defined in section
  eighteen hundred of this chapter was finally determined to be  due  from
  such  other  person  and where such tax has not been paid in full, or at
  the time such other person was convicted of a crime provided for in this
  chapter or has been convicted under the tax laws or penal  laws  of  any
  other  state,  or  a  political  subdivision of this state or such other
  state, or of the United State of a criminal offense which, if  committed
  and  prosecuted  in  this  state, would constitute a similar crime under
  this chapter, within the preceding five years or at the time the license
  of such other person was cancelled or suspended pursuant to  subdivision
  four  of  this  section  within the preceding five years, or at the time
  such other person committed any of the acts or omissions which  are,  or
  was  convicted  as, specified in subdivision four of this section within
  the preceding five years, provided, however, where an applicant or  such
  officer,  director,  partner,  shareholder or employee of such applicant
  was only an employee of another person, the  applicable  examination  of
  tax  payment  history of such other person shall be limited to the taxes
  imposed by this article or by or pursuant  to  article  twenty-eight  or
  twenty-nine  of  this  chapter  with  respect  to  motor  fuel  and  the
  applicable examination of prior criminal convictions shall be limited to
  those which relate to motor fuel, (f) the license of such  applicant  or
  of  an  officer,  director  or  partner  of  such applicant, shareholder
  directly or indirectly owning more than ten percent  of  the  number  of
  shares   of   stock  of  such  applicant  (where  such  applicant  is  a
  corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for  the  election  of
  directors  or  trustees,  or  employee  or shareholder of such applicant
  under a duty to file a return under or pursuant to the authority of this
  article or to pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant to the  authority  of
  this article on behalf of such applicant has been cancelled or suspended
  pursuant  to  subdivision four of this section within the preceding five
  years, or (g) the applicant, an officer,  director  or  partner  of  the
  applicant,  a  shareholder  directly  or indirectly owning more than ten
  percent of the number of shares of stock of such applicant  (where  such
  applicant is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for the
  election of directors or trustees, or an employee or shareholder of such
  applicant  under  a  duty  to  file  a  return  under or pursuant to the

  the  authority of this article on behalf of the applicant, has committed


 any of the acts or omissions which are, or was convicted  as,  specified
  in subdivision four of this section within the preceding five years, the
  commissioner may refuse to register such applicant.
    3.  The  commissioner  may  require a transporter seeking licensing to
  file with the department a bond issued by a surety company  approved  by
  the   superintendent   of   financial   services   as  to  solvency  and
  responsibility and authorized to transact  business  in  this  state  or
  other  security  acceptable  to  the commissioner, in such amount as the
  commissioner may fix, in an amount determined in accordance  with  rules
  and   regulations   prescribed   by  the  commissioner,  to  secure  the
  performance by such  transporter  of  the  duties  and  responsibilities
  required  (i)  pursuant  to  this  article and (ii) pursuant to articles
  twenty-eight and twenty-nine of this chapter with respect to motor fuel.
  The commissioner may require that such a bond or other security be filed
  before a  transporter  is  licensed,  and  the  amount  thereof  may  be
  increased  at  any  time when in the commissioner's judgment the same is
  necessary.  If  securities  are  deposited  as   security   under   this
  subdivision,  such  securities shall be kept in the joint custody of the
  comptroller and the commissioner and may be sold by the commissioner  if
  it  becomes  necessary  so  to  do  in  order  to  recover  against such
  transporter but no such sale shall be had until after  such  transporter
  shall  have had opportunity to litigate the validity of the liability if
  it elects so to do. Upon any such sale the surplus, if  any,  above  the
  sums  due  shall  be  returned to such transporter. The department, when
  authorized by the transporter, shall furnish information  regarding  the
  transporter's  license  and  any other information which the transporter
  authorizes it to disclose.
    4. The license of  any  importing  or  exporting  transporter  may  be
  cancelled  or  suspended  by  the  commissioner  where a licensee, or an
  officer, director, shareholder, employee or partner of the licensee  who
  as  such  officer, director, shareholder, employee or partner is under a
  duty to act for such licensee or any shareholder directly or  indirectly
  owning  more  than  ten  percent of the number of shares of stock of the
  licensee (where such licensee is a  corporation)  entitling  the  holder
  thereof  to  vote  for  the  election  of  directors or trustees of such
  licensee, fails to file a bond or other security when required  or  when
  the  amount  thereof  is  increased,  or fails to comply with any of the
  provisions of this article or article twenty-eight of this chapter  with
  respect  to  motor  fuel or any rule or regulation with respect to motor
  fuel adopted pursuant to such articles  by  the  department  or  by  the
  commissioner,  or  knowingly  aids and abets another person in violating
  any of the provisions of such articles or of any such rule or regulation
  with respect to motor fuel, or transfers its  license  as  an  importing
  transporter or exporting transporter. A license may also be cancelled or
  suspended  if the commissioner determines that a licensee or an officer,
  director, shareholder, employee or partner of the licensee who  as  such
  officer,  director,  shareholder, employee or partner is under a duty to
  act for such licensee or any shareholder directly or  indirectly  owning
  more  than  ten percent of the number of shares of stock of the licensee
  (where such licensee is a corporation) entitling the holder  thereof  to
  vote for the election of directors or trustees of such licensee:
    (i)  commits fraud or deceit in his operations as a transporter or has
  committed fraud or deceit in procuring his license;
    (ii) has been convicted in a court of competent  jurisdiction,  either
  within  or  without the state, of a felony, as defined under subdivision
  eight of section two hundred eighty-three of this  article,  bearing  on
  such transporter's duties and obligations under this chapter;


   (iii)  has  knowingly aided and abetted a person who is not registered
  as a distributor in the importation, production,  refining,  manufacture
  or compounding of motor fuel; or
    (iv)  has  knowingly  aided and abetted the distribution of motor fuel
  imported, caused to be  imported,  produced,  refined,  manufactured  or
  compounded by a distributor who is not registered by the department.
    A  license  may  also  be  cancelled  or suspended if the commissioner
  determines  that  a  licensee  or  an  officer,  director,  shareholder,
  employee  or  partner  of  the  licensee  who as such officer, director,
  shareholder, employee or partner  is  under  a  duty  to  act  for  such
  licensee  or any shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than ten
  percent of the number of shares of stock of  the  licensee  (where  such
  licensee  is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for the
  election of directors or trustees of  such  licensee,  was  an  officer,
  director, shareholder, employee or partner of another person who as such
  officer,  director, shareholder, employee or partner was under a duty to
  act for such other person or was a shareholder  directly  or  indirectly
  owning  more  than  ten percent of the number of shares of stock of such
  other person (where such other person is a  corporation)  entitling  the
  holder thereof to vote for the election of directors or trustees of such
  other  person at the time such other person committed any of the acts or
  omissions which are, or was convicted as, specified in this  subdivision
  within the preceding five years.
    5.  A  license  shall  not  be  cancelled  or  suspended  nor shall an
  application for a license be refused unless the  licensee  or  applicant
  for  a  license has had an opportunity for a hearing, provided, however,
  that an application for a license may be denied without a prior hearing.
  Provided, further, a license may be cancelled  or  suspended  without  a
  prior hearing, for failure to file a return or report within ten days of
  the  date  prescribed for filing under this article or for nonpayment of
  any sums due  pursuant  to  this  article  or  article  twenty-eight  or
  twenty-nine  of  this chapter with respect to motor fuel if the licensee
  shall have failed to file such return or report or pay such sums  within
  ten  days  after  the  date the demand therefor is sent by registered or
  certified  mail  to  the  address  of  the  transporter  given  in   his
  application for a license, or an address substituted therefor as in this
  subdivision.  A  license  may  also be cancelled or suspended prior to a
  hearing for the failure to continue to maintain in full force and effect
  at all times the bond or other security  filed  with  the  commissioner.
  Provided,  however,  if  a surety bond is cancelled prior to expiration,
  the commissioner, after considering all the relevant circumstances,  may
  make  such  other arrangements and require the filing of such other bond
  or other security  as  the  commissioner  deems  appropriate.  Provided,
  further,  a license may be cancelled or suspended prior to a hearing for
  the transfer of such license. A transporter shall immediately inform the
  department, in writing, of  any  change  in  its  address  and,  if  the
  transporter  is  a  corporation  or  partnership,  the transporter shall
  immediately inform the department, in writing,  of  any  change  in  its
  officers, directors or partners or their residence addresses as shown in
  its application for a license.
    6.  The provisions of subdivisions six, eight, nine and ten of section
  two hundred eighty-three of this article shall apply to  the  provisions
  of this section in the same manner and with the same force and effect as
  if the language of these subdivisions had been incorporated in full into
  this  section  and had expressly referred to the importing transporter's
  license or the  exporting  transporter's  license  under  this  section,
  except to the extent that any such provision is either inconsistent with
  a provision of this section or is not relevant to this section.




   §  283-b.  Licensing  of  terminal  operators.  1.  The  department of
  taxation and finance, upon the application of a person  who  operates  a
  facility  where  motor fuel is deposited, shall license such person as a
  terminal operator under this article except  as  otherwise  provided  in
  this  section.  The  application  shall  be  in  a form and contain such
  information as the department of taxation and finance  shall  prescribe.
  No  person,  unless so licensed, shall operate a terminal, except that a
  person may operate a terminal without a license if all of the motor fuel
  stored in such  facility  is  solely  for  such  person's  own  use  and
  consumption.
    2.  Where  a  person  files  an  application  for a license under this
  section and in considering such application the commissioner  ascertains
  that  (a)  any  tax imposed under this chapter or any related statute as
  defined in section eighteen hundred of this  chapter  has  been  finally
  determined  to  be due from such applicant or from any officer, director
  or partner of such applicant, shareholder directly or indirectly  owning
  more than ten percent of the number of shares of stock of such applicant
  (where  such applicant is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to
  vote for the election of directors or trustees, or  any  shareholder  or
  employee  of  such  applicant  under a duty to act for such applicant in
  complying with any requirement of this article, and has not been paid in
  full, (b) a liability for the penalty provided for under subdivision two
  of section two hundred eighty-nine-b of this article  has  been  finally
  determined  to be due from an officer, director, shareholder directly or
  indirectly owning more than ten percent of the number of shares of stock
  of such applicant (where such applicant is a corporation) entitling  the
  holder  thereof  to  vote  for  the  election  of directors or trustees,
  employee or partner of such applicant or a shareholder of such applicant
  under a duty to act for such applicant in complying with any requirement
  of this article, and has not been paid in full, (c) such  applicant  has
  been  convicted  of  a  crime  provided  for in this chapter or has been
  convicted under the tax laws or penal laws of  any  other  state,  or  a
  political  subdivision  of  this  state  or  such other state, or of the
  United States of a criminal offense which, if committed  and  prosecuted
  in  this  state,  would  constitute  a similar crime under this chapter,
  within the preceding five years, (d) an officer, director or partner  of
  such  applicant,  a  shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than
  ten percent of the number of shares of stock of  such  applicant  (where
  such  applicant  is  a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote
  for the election of directors or trustees, or an employee or shareholder
  of such applicant who, as such employee or shareholder, is under a  duty
  to  act  for  such  applicant  in complying with any requirement of this
  article, has been convicted of a crime provided for in this  chapter  or
  has  been convicted under the tax laws or penal laws of any other state,
  or a political subdivision of this state or such other state, or of  the
  United  States  of a criminal offense which, if committed and prosecuted
  in this state, would constitute a  similar  crime  under  this  chapter,
  within  the  preceding  five  years,  (e) such applicant, or an officer,
  director  or  partner  of  such  applicant,  shareholder   directly   or
  indirectly owning more than ten percent of the number of shares of stock
  of  such applicant (where such applicant is a corporation) entitling the
  holder thereof to vote for the election of  directors  or  trustees,  or
  employee  or  shareholder of such applicant under a duty to act for such
  applicant in complying with any requirement of this article, who was  an
  officer,  director  or  partner  of  another  person, or who directly or
  indirectly owned more than ten percent of the number of shares of  stock
  of  another  person (where such other person is a corporation) entitling
  the holder thereof to vote for the election of directors or trustees, or


 who was an employee or shareholder of another person under a duty to act
  for such other person in complying with any requirement of this  article
  at the time any tax imposed under this chapter or any related statute as
  defined  in  section  eighteen  hundred  of  this  chapter  was  finally
  determined to be due with respect from such other person and where  such
  tax  has  not  been  paid  in full, or at the time such other person was
  convicted of a crime provided for in this chapter or has been  convicted
  under  the  tax  laws  or  penal laws of any other state, or a political
  subdivision of this state or such other state, or of the  United  States
  of  a criminal offense which, if committed and prosecuted in this state,
  would  constitute  a  similar  crime  under  this  chapter,  within  the
  preceding  five  years,  or  at  the time the registration of such other
  person was cancelled or suspended pursuant to subdivision four  of  this
  section  within  the  preceding  five  years,  or at the time such other
  person committed any  of  the  acts  or  omissions  which  are,  or  was
  convicted  as,  specified in subdivision four of this section within the
  preceding five years, provided, however,  where  an  applicant  or  such
  officer,  director,  partner,  shareholder or employee of such applicant
  was only an employee of another person, the  applicable  examination  of
  tax  payment  history of such other person shall be limited to the taxes
  imposed by this article or by or pursuant  to  article  twenty-eight  or
  twenty-nine  of  this  chapter  with  respect  to  motor  fuel  and  the
  applicable examination of prior criminal convictions shall be limited to
  those which relate to motor fuel, (f) the license of such  applicant  or
  of  an  officer,  director  or  partner  of  such applicant, shareholder
  directly or indirectly owning more than ten percent  of  the  number  of
  shares   of   stock  of  such  applicant  (where  such  applicant  is  a
  corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for  the  election  of
  directors  or  trustees,  or  employee  or shareholder of such applicant
  under a duty to act for such applicant in complying with any requirement
  of this article has been cancelled or suspended pursuant to  subdivision
  four  of  this  section  within  the  preceding  five  years, or (g) the
  applicant,  an  officer,  director  or  partner  of  the  applicant,   a
  shareholder  directly  or indirectly owning more than ten percent of the
  number of shares of stock of such applicant (where such applicant  is  a
  corporation)  entitling  the  holder thereof to vote for the election of
  directors or trustees, or an employee or shareholder of  such  applicant
  under a duty to act for such applicant in complying with any requirement
  of  this  article, has committed any of the acts or omissions which are,
  or was convicted as, specified  in  subdivision  four  of  this  section
  within  the  preceding  five years, the commissioner may refuse to grant
  such applicant a license.
    3. The tax commission may require a terminal operator to file with the
  department of taxation and finance a bond issued  by  a  surety  company
  approved  by the superintendent of financial services as to solvency and
  responsibility and authorized to transact  business  in  this  state  or
  other  security  acceptable to the tax commission, in such amount as the
  tax commission may fix, in an amount determined in accordance with rules
  and regulations prescribed by it, to  secure  the  performance  by  such
  terminal  operator  of  the  duties  and  responsibilities  required (i)
  pursuant to this article and (ii) pursuant to articles twenty-eight  and
  twenty-nine  of  this  chapter  with  respect  to  motor  fuel.  The tax
  commission may require that such a  bond  or  other  security  be  filed
  before  a  terminal  operator is licensed, and the amount thereof may be
  increased at any time when in its judgment the  same  is  necessary.  If
  securities  are  deposited  as  security  under  this  subdivision, such
  securities shall be kept in the joint custody of the comptroller and the
  commissioner of taxation  and  finance  and  may  be  sold  by  the  tax


 commission  if it becomes necessary so to do in order to recover against
  such terminal operator but no such sale shall be had  until  after  such
  terminal operator shall have had opportunity to litigate the validity of
  the  liability if it elects so to do. Upon any such sale the surplus, if
  any, above the sums due shall be returned to such terminal operator. The
  department, when authorized by  the  terminal  operator,  shall  furnish
  information  regarding  the  terminal  operator's  license and any other
  information which the terminal operator authorizes it to disclose.
    4. The license of any terminal operator may be cancelled or  suspended
  by   the  commissioner  where  a  licensee,  or  an  officer,  director,
  shareholder, employee or partner of the registrant who as such  officer,
  director,  shareholder,  employee  or partner is under a duty to act for
  such licensee or any shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than
  ten percent of the number of shares of stock of the licensee (where such
  licensee is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for  the
  election of directors or trustees of such licensee, fails to file a bond
  or other security when required or when the amount thereof is increased,
  or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this article or article
  twenty-eight  of  this chapter with respect to motor fuel or any rule or
  regulation with respect to motor fuel adopted pursuant to such  articles
  by  the  department  of  taxation and finance or by the commissioner or,
  knowingly aids  and  abets  another  person  in  violating  any  of  the
  provisions  of  such  articles  or  of  any such rule or regulation with
  respect to motor fuel, or transfers its license as a terminal  operator.
  A  license  may  also  be  cancelled  or  suspended  if the commissioner
  determines  that  a  licensee  or  an  officer,  director,  shareholder,
  employee  or  partner  of  the  licensee  who as such officer, director,
  shareholder, employee or partner  is  under  a  duty  to  act  for  such
  licensee  or any shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than ten
  percent of the number of shares of stock of  the  licensee  (where  such
  licensee  is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for the
  election of directors or trustees of such licensee:
    (i) commits fraud or deceit in his operations as a  terminal  operator
  or has committed fraud or deceit in procuring his license;
    (ii)  has  been convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction, either
  within or without  the  state,  of  a  felony,  within  the  meaning  of
  subdivision  eight  of section two hundred eighty-three of this article,
  bearing on such terminal operator's duties and  obligations  under  this
  chapter;
    (iii)  has  knowingly aided and abetted a person who is not registered
  as a distributor in the importation, production,  refining,  manufacture
  or compounding of motor fuel; or
    (iv)  has  knowingly  aided and abetted the distribution of motor fuel
  which he has knowledge of as being  imported,  caused  to  be  imported,
  produced,  refined,  manufactured  or compounded by a distributor who is
  not registered by the department of taxation and finance.
    A license may also be  cancelled  or  suspended  if  the  commissioner
  determines  that  a  licensee  or  an  officer,  director,  shareholder,
  employee or partner of the  licensee  who  as  such  officer,  director,
  shareholder,  employee  or  partner  is  under  a  duty  to act for such
  licensee or any shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than  ten
  percent  of  the  number  of shares of stock of the licensee (where such
  licensee is a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for  the
  election  of  directors  or  trustees  of such licensee, was an officer,
  director, shareholder, employee or partner of another person who as such
  officer, director, shareholder, employee or partner was under a duty  to
  act  for  such  other person or was a shareholder directly or indirectly
  owning more than ten percent of the number of shares of  stock  of  such


 other  person  (where  such other person is a corporation) entitling the
  holder thereof to vote for the election of directors or trustees of such
  other person at the time such other person committed any of the acts  or
  omissions  which are, or was convicted as, specified in this subdivision
  within the preceding five years.
    5. A license  shall  not  be  cancelled  or  suspended  nor  shall  an
  application  for  a  license be refused unless the licensee or applicant
  for a license has had an opportunity for a hearing,  provided,  however,
  that an application for a license may be denied without a prior hearing.
  Provided,  further,  a  license  may be cancelled or suspended without a
  prior hearing, for failure to file a return or report within ten days of
  the date prescribed for filing under this article or nonpayment  of  any
  sums due pursuant to this article or article twenty-eight or twenty-nine
  of  this  chapter  with respect to motor fuel if the licensee shall have
  failed to file such return or report or pay taxes within ten days  after
  the  date the demand therefor is sent by registered or certified mail to
  the address of the terminal operator given  in  his  application  for  a
  license,  or  an  address substituted therefor as in this subdivision. A
  license may be cancelled or suspended prior to a hearing for the failure
  to continue to maintain in full  force  and  effect  at  all  times  the
  required bond or other security filed with the tax commission. Provided,
  however,  if  a  surety  bond  is cancelled prior to expiration, the tax
  commission, after considering all the relevant circumstances,  may  make
  such  other  arrangements  and  require the filing of such other bond or
  other security as it deems appropriate. Provided, further, a license may
  be cancelled or suspended prior to a hearing for the  transfer  of  such
  license. A terminal operator shall immediately inform the department, in
  writing, of any change in its address and, if the terminal operator is a
  corporation  or  partnership,  the  terminal  operator shall immediately
  inform the department, in  writing,  of  any  change  in  its  officers,
  directors  or  partners  or  their  residence  addresses as shown in its
  application for a license.
    6. The provisions of subdivisions six, eight, nine and ten of  section
  two  hundred  eighty-three of this article shall apply to the provisions
  of this section in the same manner and with the same force and effect as
  if the language of these subdivisions had been incorporated in full into
  this section and had  expressly  referred  to  the  terminal  operator's
  license under this section, except to the extent that any such provision
  is  either  inconsistent  with  a  provision  of  this section or is not
  relevant to this section.




   §  283-c.  Liquefied  petroleum  gas  fuel  permit.  The department of
  taxation and finance,  upon  the  application  of  a  person  importing,
  manufacturing  or  selling  liquefied petroleum gas identified as a fuel
  for use in the operation of a motor vehicle or for use in the  operation
  of a pleasure or recreational motor boat or using or consuming liquefied
  petroleum  gas  for  such  purpose,  may  issue  such person a liquefied
  petroleum gas fuel permit in lieu of registration as  a  distributor  of
  motor fuel pursuant to section two hundred eighty-three of this article,
  provided  such  person  does  not import motor fuel other than liquefied
  petroleum gas fuel or cause motor fuel other  than  liquefied  petroleum
  gas fuel to be imported into the state for use, distribution, storage or
  sale in the state or produce, refine, manufacture or compound motor fuel
  other than liquefied petroleum gas fuel in the state. All the provisions
  of  section  two  hundred  eighty-three  of  this article shall apply to
  applicants for liquefied petroleum gas fuel permits under  this  section
  and  to  holders  of liquefied petroleum gas fuel permits, provided that
  the commissioner of taxation and finance may waive the requirement  that
  holders  of  liquefied  petroleum  gas fuel permits file a bond or other
  security. Holders of liquefied  petroleum  gas  fuel  permits  shall  be
  subject to all other provisions of this article and article twenty-eight
  of  this  chapter  relating to distributors of motor fuel, including but
  not limited to, the keeping of records, the  fixing,  determination  and
  payment  of  tax  and  filing of returns. A liquefied petroleum gas fuel
  permit applies only  to  the  importation,  manufacture,  sale,  use  or
  consumption  of liquefied petroleum gas fuel and shall not be considered
  a distributor registration under this chapter with respect to any  motor
  fuel  product  other  than  liquefied  petroleum  gas.  No  holder  of a
  liquefied petroleum gas fuel permit shall import or cause any motor fuel
  other than liquefied petroleum gas fuel to be imported into  the  state,
  for  use,  distribution,  storage  or  sale  within  the  state or shall
  produce, refine, manufacture or compound motor fuel other than liquefied
  petroleum gas fuel within the state.




   §  283-d.  Registration of wholesalers of motor fuel. (a) Registration
  required. Each wholesaler of motor fuel  must  be  registered  with  the
  department  under this section. No wholesaler of motor fuel shall make a
  sale of motor fuel in this state other than a retail sale  not  in  bulk
  unless  such  wholesaler  is  so  registered.  The  department, upon the
  application of a person, shall register such person as a  wholesaler  of
  motor  fuel  except  that  the  commissioner  may  refuse to register an
  applicant for any of the grounds specified in subdivision two or five of
  section two hundred eighty-three of this article or in  subdivision  (c)
  of  this section. The application shall be in such form and contain such
  information as the commissioner shall prescribe. All of  the  provisions
  of  subdivisions  two,  four,  five,  six, seven, eight, nine and ten of
  section  two  hundred  eighty-three  of   this   article   relating   to
  registration  of distributors shall be applicable to the registration of
  wholesalers of motor fuel under this section with  the  same  force  and
  effect  as if the language of such subdivisions had been incorporated in
  full in this section and had expressly referred to the  registration  of
  wholesalers of motor fuel, with such modification as may be necessary in
  order to adapt the language of such provisions to the provisions of this
  section,  provided,  specifically,  that the term "distributor" shall be
  read as "wholesaler of motor  fuel."  Provided,  however,  that  if  the
  commissioner  is  satisfied that the requirements of such provisions for
  registration are not necessary in order to  protect  tax  revenues,  the
  commissioner  may  limit or modify such requirements with respect to any
  person not required to be registered as a distributor of motor fuel.
    (b) Bond or other security. The commissioner may require a  wholesaler
  of  motor fuel seeking a registration to file with the department a bond
  issued by a surety company approved by the superintendent  of  financial
  services  as  to  solvency and responsibility and authorized to transact
  business in this state or other security acceptable to the commissioner,
  in such amount as the commissioner may fix to secure the performance  by
  such  wholesaler  of  motor  fuel  of  the  duties  and responsibilities
  required (i) pursuant to this article  and  (ii)  pursuant  to  articles
  twenty-eight and twenty-nine of this chapter with respect to motor fuel.
  The commissioner may require that such a bond or other security be filed
  before  a wholesaler of motor fuel is registered, and the amount thereof
  may be increased at any time when in  the  commissioner's  judgment  the
  same  is  necessary.  If securities are deposited as security under this
  subdivision, such securities shall be kept in the joint custody  of  the
  comptroller  and the commissioner and may be sold by the commissioner if
  it becomes  necessary  so  to  do  in  order  to  recover  against  such
  wholesaler  of motor fuel but no such sale shall be had until after such
  wholesaler of motor fuel shall have  had  opportunity  to  litigate  the
  validity  of the liability if it elects to do so. Upon any such sale the
  surplus, if any, above the sums due shall be returned to such wholesaler
  of motor fuel. The department, when  authorized  by  the  wholesaler  of
  motor  fuel, shall furnish information regarding the registration of the
  wholesaler of motor fuel and any other information which the  wholesaler
  of motor fuel authorizes it to disclose.
    (c)  Refusal  to  register. For the purposes of determining whether to
  refuse  an  application  for  registration  under  this   section,   the
  references  in  subdivision  two  of section two hundred eighty-three of
  this article to employees or shareholders under a duty to file a  return
  under  or  pursuant  to  the  authority of this article or pay the taxes
  imposed by or pursuant to the authority of this article on behalf of the
  applicant or another person shall be deemed to also include an  employee
  under  a  duty  to  file  a return or pay taxes under or pursuant to the
  authority of this article on behalf of such applicant or  other  person.


 In addition to the grounds specified in section two hundred eighty-three
  of  this  article,  the commissioner may refuse to register an applicant
  where the  commissioner  ascertains  that  the  applicant,  an  officer,
  director  or  partner  of  the  applicant,  a  shareholder  directly  or
  indirectly owning more than ten percent of the number of shares of stock
  of such applicant (where such applicant is a corporation) entitling  the
  holder  thereof to vote for the election of directors or trustees, or an
  employee or shareholder of such  applicant  who,  as  such  employee  or
  shareholder  is  under  a duty to file a return under or pursuant to the
  authority of this article or to pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant  to
  the  authority  of  this  article  on  behalf  of the applicant; (1) has
  committed any of the acts or omissions which are, or was  convicted  as,
  specified  in  subdivision (d) of this section within the preceding five
  years; or (2) was an officer, director or partner of another person,  or
  who  directly or indirectly owned more than ten percent of the shares of
  stock of another person (where  such  other  person  is  a  corporation)
  entitling  the  holder  thereof to vote for the election of directors or
  trustees, or who was an employee or shareholder of another person  under
  a  duty  to  file  a  return  under or pursuant to the authority of this
  article or pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant to the authority of this
  article on behalf of such other person at the  time  such  other  person
  committed  any  of the acts or omissions which are, or was convicted as,
  specified in subdivision (d) of this section within the  preceding  five
  years.
    (d)  Cancellation  or  suspension  of  registration. The grounds for a
  cancellation or suspension of a registration under  this  section  as  a
  wholesaler  of  motor  fuel  are  the same as those grounds specified in
  section two hundred eighty-three of this article  and,  in  addition  to
  such  grounds,  the  following  grounds  relating  to this article shall
  apply:
    (1) A registration as a wholesaler of motor fuel may be  cancelled  or
  suspended  if  the  commissioner  determines  that  a  registrant  or an
  officer, director or partner of the registrant, a  shareholder  directly
  or  indirectly  owning  more than ten percent of the number of shares of
  stock of such  registrant  (where  such  registrant  is  a  corporation)
  entitling  the  holder  thereof to vote for the election of directors or
  trustees, or an employee or shareholder of such registrant under a  duty
  to  file  a return under or pursuant to the authority of this article or
  to pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant to the authority of this article
  on behalf of the registrant
    (A) fails to file or maintain in full force and effect a bond or other
  security when required pursuant to subdivision (b) of  this  section  or
  when the amount thereof is increased,
    (B)  fails to comply with any of the provisions of this article or any
  rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this article by the commissioner,
    (C) knowingly aids and abets another person in violating  any  of  the
  provisions of this article or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to
  this article by the commissioner,
    (D)  transfers  its registration as a wholesaler of motor fuel without
  the prior written approval of the commissioner,
    (E) with respect to a wholesaler of motor fuel which is a corporation,
  has  been  dissolved  pursuant  to  section  two  hundred  three-a   and
  subdivision (d) of section three hundred ten of this chapter,
    (F)  commits  fraud  or  deceit  in  his,  her  or its operations as a
  wholesaler of motor fuel or has committed fraud or deceit  in  procuring
  his, her or its registration,


   (G)  has  impersonated  any  person  represented to be a wholesaler of
  motor fuel under this article but not in fact registered as a wholesaler
  of motor fuel, or
    (H) has knowingly aided and abetted the distribution of motor fuel, by
  any person which such registrant or such other person knows has not been
  registered by the commissioner as required under this article.
    (2)  A  registration as a wholesaler of motor fuel may be cancelled or
  suspended if  the  commissioner  determines  that  a  registrant  or  an
  officer,  director  or partner of the registrant, a shareholder directly
  or indirectly owning more than ten percent of the number  of  shares  of
  stock  of  such  registrant  (where  such  registrant  is a corporation)
  entitling the holder thereof to vote for the election  of  directors  or
  trustees,  or an employee or shareholder of such registrant under a duty
  to file a return under or pursuant to the authority of this  article  or
  to pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant to the authority of this article
  on  behalf  of  the  registrant,  was an officer, director or partner of
  another person or was a shareholder directly or indirectly  owning  more
  than  ten  percent  of  the  number of shares of stock of another person
  (where such other person is a corporation) entitling the holder  thereof
  to vote for the election of directors or trustees, or was an employee or
  shareholder  of  another  person  under a duty to file a return under or
  pursuant to the authority of this article or to pay the taxes imposed by
  or pursuant to the authority of this article on  behalf  of  such  other
  person at the time such other person committed any of the acts specified
  in paragraph one of this subdivision within the preceding five years.
    (e) Cancellation or suspension of registration prior to a hearing. The
  grounds  for  cancelling or suspending a registration as a wholesaler of
  motor fuel prior to a hearing shall be the same as  those  specified  in
  subdivision  five  of  section  two hundred eighty-three of this article
  and, in addition to such grounds, the following grounds relating to this
  article shall apply:
    (1) the failure  to  file  a  return  within  ten  days  of  the  date
  prescribed  for  filing  a  return  under this article if the registrant
  shall have failed to file such return within ten days after the date the
  demand therefor is sent by registered or certified mail to  the  address
  of  the wholesaler of motor fuel given in its application, or an address
  substituted therefor as provided in  subdivision  five  of  section  two
  hundred eighty-three of this article,
    (2)  the  failure  to continue to maintain in full force and effect at
  all times the bond or other security required to be  filed  pursuant  to
  subdivision  (b)  of  this  section, provided, however, that if a surety
  bond is cancelled  prior  to  expiration,  the  commissioner  may  after
  considering all the relevant circumstances make such other arrangements,
  and  may  require  the filing of such other bond or other security as it
  deems appropriate,
    (3) the transfer of a registration  as  a  wholesaler  of  motor  fuel
  without the prior written approval of the commissioner, or
    (4) with respect to a wholesaler of motor fuel which is a corporation,
  the  dissolution  or  annulment  of such corporation pursuant to section
  three hundred ten of this chapter.




   §  284.  Tax imposed. 1.  There is hereby levied and imposed an excise
  tax of four cents per gallon upon motor fuel (a) imported into or caused
  to be imported into the state by a distributor  for  use,  distribution,
  storage  or  sale  in  the  state  or upon motor fuel which is produced,
  refined, manufactured or compounded by a distributor in the state (which
  acts shall hereinafter in this subdivision be encompassed by the  phrase
  "imported or manufactured") or (b) if the tax has not been imposed prior
  to its sale in this state, which is sold by a distributor (which act, in
  conjunction   with   the   acts  described  in  paragraph  (a)  of  this
  subdivision, shall hereinafter in this article  be  encompassed  by  the
  phrase   "imported,   manufactured  or  sold"),  except  when  imported,
  manufactured or sold under circumstances which preclude  the  collection
  of  such  tax by reason of the United States constitution and of laws of
  the  United  States  enacted  pursuant  thereto  or  when  imported   or
  manufactured  by  an  organization  described in paragraph one or two of
  subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred sixteen of this chapter  or  a
  hospital  included  in  the organizations described in paragraph four of
  such subdivision for its own use or consumption and except kero-jet fuel
  when imported or manufactured by an airline for use  in  its  airplanes.
  Provided, further, no motor fuel shall be included in the measure of the
  tax  unless  it shall have previously come to rest within the meaning of
  federal decisional law interpreting the United States constitution.  All
  tax  for  the period for which a return is required to be filed shall be
  due on the date limited for the filing of the return  for  such  period,
  regardless  of whether a return is filed by such distributor as required
  by this article or whether the return which is filed correctly shows the
  amount of tax due.
    2. If, prior to April first, nineteen hundred forty-seven, a  contract
  of  sale  of  motor  fuel  shall  have  been  made, and delivery thereof
  pursuant to such contract is made within the state  thereafter,  from  a
  stock  of  motor  fuel  which,  at  the  time of the taking of such fuel
  therefrom for such delivery, is subject  to  the  taxing  power  of  the
  state,  the  vendor  shall  be deemed a distributor, for the purposes of
  this article, and such motor fuel shall be deemed to be sold, and  shall
  be subject to such tax, at the time of such delivery.




   §  284-a. Additional motor fuel tax. In addition to the tax imposed by
  section two hundred eighty-four of this chapter, a  like  tax  shall  be
  imposed  at the rate of three cents per gallon upon motor fuel imported,
  manufactured or sold within this  state  by  a  distributor.  Except  as
  otherwise  provided  in this section, all the provisions of this article
  except subdivision two of section  two  hundred  eighty-nine-e  of  this
  article  shall  apply with respect to the additional tax imposed by this
  section to the same extent as if it were imposed  by  said  section  two
  hundred   eighty-four.   Beginning  on  April  first,  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-one, four and one-sixth per centum of the moneys received by  the
  department pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be deposited
  to  the  credit of the emergency highway reconditioning and preservation
  fund reserve account established pursuant to the provisions of paragraph
  (b) of subdivision two of section eighty-nine of the state finance  law.
  Beginning   on  April  first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-one,  four  and
  one-sixth per centum of the moneys received by the  department  pursuant
  to  the  provisions  of this section shall be deposited to the credit of
  the emergency  highway  construction  and  reconstruction  fund  reserve
  account  established  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of paragraph (b) of
  subdivision two of section  eighty-nine-a  of  the  state  finance  law.
  Beginning  on  April  first,  nineteen hundred ninety-two, an additional
  eight and one-third per centum of the moneys received by the  department
  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of this section shall be deposited to the
  credit of the emergency highway  reconditioning  and  preservation  fund
  reserve  account established pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)
  of subdivision two of section eighty-nine  of  the  state  finance  law.

  eight and one-third per centum of the moneys received by the  department
  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of this section shall be deposited to the
  credit of the emergency highway  construction  and  reconstruction  fund
  reserve  account established pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)
  of subdivision two of section eighty-nine-a of the  state  finance  law.
  Beginning  on  April first, two thousand, seventy-five per centum of the
  moneys received by the department pursuant to  the  provisions  of  this
  section  shall  be  deposited in the dedicated fund accounts pursuant to
  subdivision  (d)  of  section  three  hundred  one-j  of  this  chapter.
  Beginning on April first, two thousand three, all of the moneys received
  by  the  department  pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be
  deposited in the dedicated fund accounts pursuant to subdivision (d)  of

   § 284-d. Petroleum testing fee. 1. In addition to the taxes imposed by
  or pursuant to this article, there is hereby imposed a regulatory fee at
  the  rate  of  one-half of one mill per gallon upon motor fuel imported,
  manufactured or sold within this state by a distributor. The fee imposed
  by this section shall be administered and collected by the  commissioner
  of taxation and finance in the same manner as the tax imposed by section
  two  hundred  eighty-four of this article. Except for the requirement of
  subdivision one of section two hundred  eighty-five-a  of  this  article
  that  the  tax  be  passed  through  to purchasers and the provisions of
  subdivisions  one  through  five  and  nine  of  section   two   hundred
  eighty-nine-c and section two hundred eighty-nine-e of this article, all
  the  provisions of this article applicable to the tax imposed by section
  two hundred eighty-four of this article shall apply with respect to  the
  fee  imposed by this section to the same extent as if it were imposed by
  such section two hundred eighty-four, insofar as such provisions can  be
  made   applicable  to  the  fee  imposed  by  this  section,  with  such
  modification as may be necessary in order to adapt  such  provisions  to
  the  fee  imposed  by  this  section.  The  commissioner of taxation and
  finance may make such provisions as the commissioner deems necessary for
  the joint administration of the fee imposed  by  this  section  and  the
  taxes imposed by or pursuant to this article.
    2.  All  fees  imposed  by  this  section, together with penalties and
  interest thereon, which are collected or received by the commissioner of
  taxation and finance, shall be deposited  daily  with  such  responsible
  banks,  banking  houses  or trust companies, as may be designated by the
  state comptroller, to the credit of  the  comptroller.  The  comptroller
  shall  require  adequate  security  from  all  such depositories of such
  revenue collected by the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance.  The
  comptroller shall retain such amount as the commissioner of taxation and
  finance may determine to be necessary for refunds in respect to the fees
  imposed  by  this  section,  out  of which the comptroller shall pay any
  refunds of such fees to which taxpayers  shall  be  entitled  under  the
  provisions of this section. The commissioner of taxation and finance and
  the  comptroller  shall maintain a system of accounts showing the amount
  of revenue collected or received from the fee imposed by  this  section.
  The  comptroller,  after  reserving such refunds shall, on or before the
  tenth day of each month, deposit to the credit of the motor fuel quality
  account, which is hereby  established  within  the  miscellaneous  state
  special  revenue  fund,  the fees imposed by this section, together with
  penalties  and  interest  thereon,  collected  or   received   by   such
  commissioner  pursuant  to  this  section  during the preceding calendar
  month. The amount so payable shall be certified to  the  comptroller  by
  the  commissioner of taxation and finance or his delegate, who shall not
  be held liable for any inaccuracy in such certificate. Where the  amount
  so  paid over to such fund in any such distribution is more or less than
  the  amount  due  to  such  fund,  the  amount  of  the  overpayment  or
  underpayment  shall  be certified to the comptroller by the commissioner
  of taxation and finance or his delegate, who shall not  be  held  liable
  for  any  inaccuracy in such certificate.  The amount of the overpayment
  or underpayment shall be so certified to the comptroller as  soon  after
  the  discovery of the overpayment or underpayment as reasonably possible
  and subsequent payments and distributions by  the  comptroller  to  such
  fund   shall   be  adjusted  by  subtracting  the  amount  of  any  such
  underpayment from such number of subsequent payments  and  distributions
  as  the  comptroller  and the commissioner of taxation and finance shall
  consider reasonable  in  view  of  the  amount  of  the  overpayment  or
  underpayment and all other facts or circumstances.




   §  284-e.  Taxes  imposed  on  qualified reservations. 1. General. (a)
  Notwithstanding any other provision of  this  article  to  the  contrary
  qualified  Indians may purchase motor fuel or Diesel motor fuel for such
  qualified Indians' own use or consumption exempt from the motor fuel tax
  or Diesel  motor  fuel  tax  on  their  nations'  or  tribes'  qualified
  reservations.  However,  such qualified Indians purchasing motor fuel or
  Diesel motor fuel off their  reservations  or  on  another  nation's  or
  tribe's  reservation,  and non-Indians making motor fuel or Diesel motor
  fuel purchases on an Indian reservation shall not be exempt from  paying
  the  motor  fuel tax or Diesel motor fuel tax when purchasing motor fuel
  or Diesel motor fuel within this state. Accordingly, all motor fuel  and
  Diesel  motor  fuel  sold on an Indian reservation to non-members of the
  nation or tribe or to non-Indians shall be taxed.
    (b) In order to ensure an adequate quantity of motor fuel  and  Diesel
  motor  fuel  on  Indian reservations which may be purchased by qualified
  Indians exempt from the motor fuel tax and Diesel motor  fuel  tax,  the
  department  shall  provide  Indian  nations and tribes within this state
  with Indian tax exemption coupons  as  set  forth  in  this  section.  A
  reservation  motor  fuel seller shall be able to present such Indian tax
  exemption coupons to a distributor licensed pursuant to this article  in
  order  to  purchase  motor  fuel  or  Diesel  motor fuel exempt from the
  imposition of the motor fuel tax or Diesel  motor  fuel  tax.  Qualified
  Indians  may purchase motor fuel or Diesel motor fuel from a reservation
  motor fuel seller exempt from the motor fuel tax or  Diesel  motor  fuel
  tax  even  though  the  motor  fuel tax or Diesel motor fuel tax on such
  motor fuel or Diesel motor  fuel  will  have  been  previously  paid  or
  assumed by, or passed through to such distributor.
    2.  Indian  tax  exemption  coupons.  (a) Indian tax exemption coupons
  shall be provided to the recognized governing body of each Indian nation
  or tribe to ensure that each Indian nation or  tribe  can  obtain  motor
  fuel  and  Diesel  motor  fuel upon which the tax shall not be collected
  that is for the use or consumption by the nation  or  tribe  or  by  the
  members  of such nation or tribe. The Indian tax exemption coupons shall
  be provided to the Indian nations or tribes on  a  quarterly  basis  for
  each  of  the  four  quarters  beginning with the first day of December,
  March, June, and September. It is intended that the  Indian  nations  or
  tribes  will retain the amount of Indian tax exemption coupons they will
  need each quarter to purchase motor  fuel  and  Diesel  motor  fuel  for
  official  nation or tribal use, and will distribute the remaining Indian
  tax exemption coupons to reservation motor fuel sellers on such nations'
  or tribes' qualified reservations. Only  Indian  nations  or  tribes  or
  reservation  motor  fuel  sellers  on  their  qualified reservations may
  redeem such Indian tax exemption coupons pursuant to this section.
    (b) The amount of Indian tax exemption coupons  to  be  given  to  the
  recognized  governing body of each Indian nation or tribe shall be based
  upon the probable demand of the qualified Indians on  such  nation's  or
  tribe's qualified reservation plus the amount needed for official nation
  or tribal use.
    (i)  Probable  demand shall be determined by reference to, among other
  data, the United  States  average  motor  fuel  and  Diesel  motor  fuel
  consumption  per  capita,  as  compiled  for the most recently completed
  calendar or fiscal year, multiplied by the number of  qualified  Indians
  for each such affected Indian nation or tribe.
    (ii)  In  making  a  determination  of probable demand, the department
  shall take into consideration any evidence submitted by such  recognized
  governing body relating to such probable demand (e.g., a verified record
  of  previous  sales  to qualified Indians or other statistical evidence)


 and/or relating to the  amount  needed  for  such  nation's  or  tribe's
  official use.
    (c)  Each  Indian  tax  exemption  coupon shall consist of a retention
  portion for a distributor's  recordkeeping  purposes  and  a  redemption
  portion for a distributor's submission to the department when claiming a
  refund  as  set  forth  in  paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision four of this
  section, and shall contain the following information:
    (i) the identity of the Indian nation or tribe to which it is issued;
    (ii) the identity and the quantity of the  product  for  which  it  is
  issued;
    (iii) the date of issuance and the date of expiration; and
    (iv) any other information as the commissioner may deem appropriate.
    3.  Tax  exempt  purchases. (a) An Indian nation or tribe may purchase
  motor fuel and Diesel motor fuel for its own official use or consumption
  from a distributor registered pursuant to this article  without  payment
  of  the  motor  fuel tax or Diesel motor fuel tax to the extent that the
  Indian nation  or  tribe  provides  such  distributor  with  Indian  tax
  exemption  coupons entitling the Indian nation or tribe to purchase such
  quantities of motor fuel and Diesel motor fuel as allowed  for  on  each
  Indian  tax exemption coupon without paying the motor fuel tax or Diesel
  motor fuel tax.
    (b) A qualified Indian may purchase motor fuel and Diesel  motor  fuel
  for  his or her own use or consumption without payment of the motor fuel
  tax or Diesel motor fuel tax, provided that the qualified  Indian  makes
  such purchase at a qualified reservation.
    (c) A reservation motor fuel seller may purchase motor fuel and Diesel
  motor  fuel  for  resale without payment of the motor fuel tax or Diesel
  motor fuel tax from a distributor registered pursuant to this article:
    (i) provided that such reservation motor fuel seller brings such motor
  fuel or Diesel motor fuel or causes it to be delivered onto a  qualified
  reservation for resale on such reservation; and
    (ii)  to  the  extent that such reservation motor fuel seller provides
  such  distributor  with  Indian  tax  exemption  coupons  entitling  the
  reservation  motor fuel seller to purchase such quantities of motor fuel
  and Diesel motor fuel as allowed for on each Indian tax exemption coupon
  without paying the motor fuel tax or Diesel motor fuel tax.
    (d) A distributor shall not collect or pass through, as the  case  may
  be,  the  motor  fuel tax or Diesel motor fuel tax from any purchaser to
  the extent the purchaser gives such  distributor  Indian  tax  exemption
  coupons  entitling  the  purchaser  to purchase such quantities of motor
  fuel or Diesel motor fuel  as  allowed  for  on  each  such  Indian  tax
  exemption  coupon without paying the motor fuel tax or Diesel motor fuel
  tax.
    4. Refunds and credits. (a) A distributor registered pursuant to  this
  article  who  has  one  or  more Indian tax exemption coupons may file a
  claim for refund or credit  as  provided  for  in  section  two  hundred
  eighty-nine-c  of  this  article  with  respect to any motor fuel tax or
  Diesel motor fuel tax it previously paid, assumed,  or  has  had  passed
  through to it on motor fuel or Diesel motor fuel it sold without passing
  through  the tax because it accepted an Indian tax exemption coupon from
  its purchaser.
    (b) A distributor of motor fuel or  Diesel  motor  fuel  shall  report
  motor  fuel  or Diesel motor fuel sold to an Indian nation or tribe or a
  reservation motor fuel seller in its monthly return of tax on motor fuel
  or Diesel motor fuel and may deduct the quantity so sold in arriving  at
  the  net  taxable  gallonage  to  the  extent such fuel was sold without
  passing through to such purchasers the motor fuel tax  or  Diesel  motor
  fuel tax.


   5.  Tax  agreements with Indian nations or tribes. If an Indian nation
  or tribe enters into an agreement with the  state  and  the  legislature
  approves  such  agreement  regarding  the sale and distribution of motor
  fuel  or  Diesel  motor  fuel  on  the  nation's  or  tribe's  qualified
  reservation,  the terms of such agreement shall take precedence over the
  provisions of this article and exempt such nation from such taxes to the
  extent that such taxes are specifically referred to  in  the  agreement,
  and  the  sale  or  distribution, including transportation, of any motor
  fuel  or  Diesel  motor  fuel  to  the  nation's  or  tribe's  qualified
  reservation   shall  be  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  such
  agreement.




   § 285.  Special  provision  as  to  imposition of tax on certain motor
  fuel.  If a person, firm, association or corporation shall  receive  any
  motor  fuel  in such form and under such circumstances as shall preclude
  the collection  of  such  tax  from  a  distributor  by  reason  of  the
  constitution  and  laws  of the United States, and shall thereafter sell
  any such fuel in such manner and under such circumstances as may subject
  the fuel sold to the taxing power of  this  state,  such  person,  firm,
  association  or  corporation  shall  be  considered  a distributor, with
  respect to such sale, and shall make the  same  reports,  pay  the  same
  taxes and be subject to all other provisions of this article relating to
  distributors.




   §  285-a. Presumption of taxability. 1. No person shall purchase motor
  fuel in this state, excluding a purchase at  retail,  unless  the  taxes
  imposed  by  this  article have been assumed by a distributor registered
  under this article in accordance with a certification under  subdivision
  three  of this section or paid by such distributor, and, in each of such
  instances, are passed through to such  purchaser.  In  addition  to  any
  other  civil  and  criminal  penalties  which  may apply, any person who
  purchases motor fuel without having received a  certification  from  the
  seller  in  accordance  with  subdivision three of this section shall be
  jointly and severally liable to pay the taxes imposed  by  this  article
  with respect to such motor fuel.
    2. For the purpose of the proper administration of this article and to
  prevent evasion of the tax on motor fuel imposed by and pursuant to this
  article, it shall be presumed that all motor fuel imported, manufactured
  or  sold,  received  or  possessed  in  the  state  is intended for use,
  distribution, storage or sale in the state  and  subject  to  the  taxes
  imposed  by  this article until the contrary is established. It shall be
  further presumed that all motor fuel so imported, manufactured or  sold,
  received  or possessed in the state by any person, other than motor fuel
  delivered into the ordinary fuel tank connected with  the  engine  of  a
  means  of conveyance in order to propel it, or in small drums or similar
  containers, which such person cannot otherwise account for,  is  subject
  to  the taxes imposed by this article and such person is responsible for
  payment of such taxes. Provided, however, a distributor  of  motor  fuel
  who  imports,  manufactures  or  sells  and  stores  in the state or who
  purchases and stores motor fuel in the state on which he  has  paid  the
  taxes imposed by this article shall be allowed an adjustment in arriving
  at  the  gallons subject to the taxes imposed by such section on account
  of the gallons the distributor establishes were lost due  to  shrinkage,
  evaporation  and  handling;  provided, however, such allowance shall not
  exceed two percent of  the  fuel  stored.  Provided,  further,  that  in
  arriving  at  the  gallons of motor fuel subject to the taxes imposed by
  this article, there shall be allowed an adjustment on account of gallons
  lost or destroyed due to an accident, such as fire, and at the  time  of
  such  loss  or destruction were being held or transported for sale other
  than at retail. The burden of proving that any  motor  fuel  is  not  so
  subject  shall  be  upon the person so responsible for such payment with
  respect to such fuel.
    3. (a) Upon each sale of motor fuel, other than a sale at retail,  the
  seller must give to the purchaser and the purchaser shall receive at the
  time  of  delivery  of  such motor fuel, a certification containing such
  information as the tax commission shall require which  shall  include  a
  statement  to the effect: (i) if such seller is a distributor registered
  under this article, that he assumed the payment of  or  paid  the  taxes
  imposed  by  this  article  and,  in  each case, is passing through such
  taxes; or (ii) that such seller is passing through such taxes which were
  so previously assumed or paid by an  identified  distributor  registered
  under this article, and passed through to him.
    (b)  If  the  certification  required  by  this  subdivision  has been
  furnished to the purchaser at delivery and accepted in good  faith,  the
  burden of proving that the taxes imposed by this article were assumed or
  paid  by  a distributor registered as such under this article and passed
  through shall be solely on the seller.
    (c) Where the certification  required  under  this  paragraph  is  not
  furnished  by the seller at delivery of motor fuel, it shall be presumed
  that the taxes imposed by this article have not been assumed or paid  by
  a  distributor  registered  as  such  under  this  article  and that the
  purchaser in such case is jointly and severally liable for such taxes.


   (d) If, due to the circumstances of delivery, it is  not  possible  to
  issue  a  certification  required  under this subdivision at the time of
  delivery of motor fuel, the tax commission may authorize the delivery of
  the certification required under this paragraph  at  a  time  after  the
  delivery  of  the  motor fuel which is the subject of the sale under the
  limited circumstances  it  shall  prescribe  and  upon  such  terms  and
  conditions  it  shall  deem  necessary to ensure collection of the taxes
  imposed by this article and the tax imposed by  section  eleven  hundred
  two of this chapter.
    * 4. Upon each sale of motor fuel, other than a sale that is otherwise
  exempt  under  this article, the distributor must charge the tax imposed
  by this article to the purchaser on  each  gallon  sold.  If  the  taxes
  imposed  by  this  article  have  not  already been assumed or paid by a
  distributor on any quantity of such fuel for any reason, including,  but
  not  limited  to,  the expansion of such fuel as a result of temperature
  fluctuation, the distributor must remit such taxes to  the  commissioner
  on the return for the period in which such sale was made.
    * NB Effective September 1, 2023




   §  285-b. Presumption of taxability--Diesel motor fuel. 1. Except with
  respect to the exemptions from the excise tax on Diesel motor  fuel  set
  forth  in  subdivision three of section two hundred eighty-two-a of this
  article, no person shall purchase Diesel motor fuel in this state unless
  the taxes imposed by this article have  been  assumed  by  a  registered
  distributor  of  Diesel  motor  fuel  in accordance with a certification
  under subdivision four of this section or paid by such distributor  and,
  in  each  of such instances, except in the case of an exemption from the
  pass through of such tax authorized in subdivision four of such  section
  two  hundred  eighty-two-a,  are  passed  through  to such purchaser. In
  addition to any other civil and criminal penalties which may apply,  any
  person  who  purchases  Diesel  motor  fuel  without  having  received a
  certification from the seller in accordance  with  subdivision  four  of
  this  section  shall  be  jointly  and severally liable to pay the taxes
  imposed by this article with respect to such Diesel motor fuel.
    2. For purposes of the proper administration of this  article  and  to
  prevent  evasion  of  the  taxes  imposed  on  Diesel motor fuel by this
  article, it shall be presumed that all Diesel motor fuel sold,  received
  or  possessed  in  the  state  is  subject  to the taxes imposed by this
  article until the contrary is established. It shall be further  presumed
  that  any  person  so selling, receiving or possessing such Diesel motor
  fuel is responsible for payment of the excise taxes on such fuel.
    3.  (a)  The  claim  for  or  exemption  from  tax  provided  for   in
  subparagraphs  (i),  (ii),  (iii),  (iv),  and  (vi) of paragraph (b) of
  subdivision three of section two hundred eighty-two-a  of  this  article
  shall  be  established by means of an exempt transaction certificate. If
  any such exemption is applicable, such certificate shall be provided  by
  the  purchaser  to the seller at the time of or prior to delivery of the
  Diesel motor fuel. Such exempt transaction certificate shall  set  forth
  the name and address of the purchaser and the basis of the exemption and
  shall  be  signed  by such purchaser and by the seller. Such certificate
  shall be in  such  form  and  contain  such  other  information  as  the
  commissioner   shall   require.  Where  a  proper  and  complete  exempt
  transaction certificate has been furnished and accepted by the seller in
  good faith, such certificate under such circumstance shall  relieve  the
  seller  of  the  burden of proving that the Diesel motor fuel covered by
  such certificate is exempt from tax by reason of subparagraph (i), (ii),
  (iii), (iv), or (vi) of paragraph  (b)  of  subdivision  three  of  such
  section  two  hundred  eighty-two-a.  Any purchaser who furnishes to his
  seller a false or fraudulent  exempt  transaction  certificate  for  the
  purpose of establishing an exemption from the tax imposed by section two
  hundred  eighty-two-a  of  this  article  shall be jointly and severally
  liable for the tax imposed  by  such  section.  In  lieu  of  an  exempt
  transaction   certificate,   the   commissioner   may  provide  for  the
  establishment of such  exemption  by  means  of  a  procedure  or  other
  document  which he or she deems appropriate so as to secure the revenues
  from the excise tax on Diesel motor fuel. Provided, further, in the case
  of the exemption provided  by  subparagraph  (i)  of  paragraph  (b)  of
  subdivision  three  of section two hundred eighty-two-a of this article,
  the commissioner shall provide for an  alternative  procedure  or  other
  document  signed  only by the seller, such as a metered delivery ticket,
  for the establishment of  such  exemption  in  those  cases  where  such
  commissioner  is satisfied that the use of such alternative procedure or
  other document will not jeopardize the revenues from the excise  tax  on
  Diesel motor fuel.
    (b)  A  claim  for the exemption from tax provided for in subparagraph
  (v) of paragraph  (b)  of  subdivision  three  of  section  two  hundred
  eighty-two-a  of  this  article  shall  be  established  by  means of an


 interdistributor sale certificate. If such exemption is applicable, such
  certificate shall be provided by the purchaser to the seller at the time
  of or prior to delivery of the Diesel motor fuel. Such certificate shall
  set  forth  the  name  and  address  of  the  purchaser, the purchaser's
  registration number, an affirmation by such purchaser that the purchaser
  is registered as a distributor and that such registration has  not  been
  suspended  or cancelled and shall be signed by such purchaser and by the
  seller. Such certificate shall be in such form and  contain  such  other
  information  as  the  commissioner  shall  require.  Where  a proper and
  complete  interdistributor  sale  certificate  has  been  furnished  and
  accepted  by  the  seller  in  good  faith,  such certificate under such
  circumstance shall relieve the seller of the burden of proving that  the
  Diesel  motor  fuel  covered  by  such certificate is exempt from tax by
  reason of subparagraph (v) of paragraph (b) of subdivision three of such
  section two hundred eighty-two-a. For  purposes  of  this  paragraph,  a
  seller  shall  not  have  accepted such certificate in good faith if the
  purchaser's registration is invalid because it  has  been  suspended  or
  cancelled,  or  if the purchaser is not registered, and the commissioner
  has furnished registered distributors with information  identifying  all
  those  persons  then  validly registered as distributors of Diesel motor
  fuel and those  persons  whose  registrations  have  been  suspended  or
  cancelled.  Any  purchaser  who  furnishes  to  his  seller  a  false or
  fraudulent  interdistributor  sale  certificate  for  the   purpose   of
  establishing  an  exemption  from the tax imposed by section two hundred
  eighty-two-a of this article shall be jointly and severally  liable  for
  the tax imposed by such section.
    4.  (a)  Upon  each  sale,  other  than a retail sale not in bulk, the
  seller must give to the purchaser and the purchaser shall receive at the
  time of delivery of such Diesel motor fuel, a  certification  containing
  such  information  as  the  commissioner  of  taxation and finance shall
  require which,  unless  otherwise  provided  in  this  paragraph,  shall
  include  a  statement to the effect: (i) if such seller is a distributor
  registered under this article, that he has assumed  the  payment  of  or
  paid  the  taxes  imposed  by this article and, in each case, is passing
  through such taxes; or (ii) that such seller  is  passing  through  such
  taxes  which  were  so  previously  assumed  or  paid  by  an identified
  distributor registered under this article, and passed through to him. In
  the case  of  a  transaction  described  in  paragraph  (a)  or  (b)  of
  subdivision  three  of  section two hundred eighty-two-a of this article
  which is exempt from the imposition of the taxes imposed on Diesel motor
  fuel or where the seller, pursuant to and in accordance with subdivision
  four of  such  section,  has  not  passed  through  such  taxes  to  the
  purchaser,   the  certificate,  in  lieu  of  either  of  the  foregoing
  statements, shall state that, based  upon  good  faith  reliance  on  an
  exempt  transaction  certificate  (or  such  other  similar  document or
  procedure prescribed by the commissioner of taxation  and  finance),  an
  interdistributor sales certificate or the exemption document provided by
  an  organization described in paragraph one or two of subdivision (a) of
  section eleven hundred sixteen of this chapter, as the case may be, such
  motor fuel is being sold  under  the  circumstances  described  in  such
  paragraph  (a)  or  (b)  of  subdivision  three  of  section two hundred
  eighty-two-a or, in the case of the exemption from the pass through,  is
  being sold under the circumstances specified in subdivision four of such
  section and that the taxes imposed by this article are not applicable or
  are not being passed through, as the case may be.
    (b)  In  the case of a sale of Diesel motor fuel subject to the excise
  taxes and in all cases where the excise taxes are required to be  passed
  through,  if  the  certification  required  by this subdivision has been


 furnished to the purchaser at the time of  delivery  of  such  fuel  and
  accepted  in good faith, the burden of proving that the taxes imposed by
  this article were assumed or paid by a distributor  registered  as  such
  under this article and passed through shall be solely on the seller.
    (c)  Where  the  certification  required under this subdivision is not
  furnished by the seller at the time of  delivery  of  the  Diesel  motor
  fuel,  it  shall  be presumed that the taxes imposed by this article are
  due and owing and have  not  been  assumed  or  paid  by  a  distributor
  registered  as  such  under  this article and that the purchaser in such
  case is jointly and severally liable for such taxes.
    (d) If, due to the circumstances of delivery, it is  not  possible  to
  issue  a  certification  required  under this subdivision at the time of
  delivery of Diesel motor fuel, the commissioner of taxation and  finance
  may  authorize  the  delivery  of  the certification required under this
  subdivision at a time after the delivery of the Diesel motor fuel  which
  is  the  subject  of  the  sale under the limited circumstances it shall
  prescribe and upon such terms and conditions it shall deem necessary  to
  ensure  collection  of  the  taxes  imposed  by this article and the tax
  imposed by section eleven hundred three of this chapter.
    * 5. Upon each sale of Diesel motor fuel, other than a  sale  that  is
  otherwise exempt under this article, the distributor must charge the tax
  imposed  by  this  article  to the purchaser on each gallon sold. If the
  taxes imposed by this article have not already been assumed or paid by a
  distributor on any quantity of such fuel for any reason, including,  but
  not  limited  to,  the expansion of such fuel as a result of temperature
  fluctuation, the distributor must remit such taxes to  the  commissioner
  on the return for the period in which such sale was made.

   § 286. Records to be kept by distributors and others.  1. Every person
  who  imports  or causes to be imported into this state, or who produces,
  refines, manufactures or compounds within this state, or  who  purchases
  or  sells  in  this state motor fuel or diesel motor fuel or ingredients
  which may be manufactured or compounded into motor fuel or diesel  motor
  fuel,  shall  keep  a  complete and accurate record of all purchases and
  sales, uses or other dispositions thereof and a  complete  and  accurate
  record  of  the  number of gallons of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel or
  such  ingredients  so  imported,  produced,  refined,  manufactured   or
  compounded.  Every  person  who  stores  motor fuel or diesel motor fuel
  shall keep a complete and accurate record of the identity of the  person
  for  whom  such fuel is stored, the quantity and type of fuel so stored,
  the identity of the person to whom such fuel is  released  from  storage
  and  the quantity and type of fuel so released. Such records shall be in
  such form and contain such other information as the  commissioner  shall
  prescribe.  Said  commissioner,  by rule or regulation, also may require
  the delivery of statements to purchasers with consignments of motor fuel
  or diesel motor fuel or such ingredients, and prescribe the  matters  to
  be  contained  therein.  Such records and statements, unless required by
  the commissioner to be preserved for a longer period, shall be preserved
  for a period of three years and shall be offered for inspection  at  any
  time   upon   oral  or  written  demand  by  such  commissioner  or  the
  commissioner's  duly  authorized  agents.  The  commissioner  is  hereby
  further   authorized  to  examine  the  equipment  of  any  such  person
  pertaining to the storage, sale or delivery of such fuels,  as  well  as
  the  stock of such fuels in the possession or control of such person. To
  verify the amount of tax due under this article,  each  such  person  is
  hereby  directed  and  required  to  give  to  the  commissioner  or the
  commissioner's duly authorized representatives,  the  means,  facilities
  and  opportunity  for  such  examinations as are herein provided for and
  required. Nothing contained  in  this  section  shall  be  construed  to
  require  the  keeping  for  purposes  of  this  article  of  a record of
  purchases  or  sales  of  motor  fuel  or  diesel  motor  fuel  or  such
  ingredients  at retail in small quantities (less than thirty gallons) or
  of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel imported into this state in the  tank
  of a motor vehicle which supplies the fuel for its operation.
    2.  The  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance  may, by regulation,
  provide for the filing of monthly information returns  by  every  person
  required  to  maintain such records, as prescribed in subdivision one of
  this  section,  which  shall  in  all  material  respects  reflect   the
  information required to be contained in such records. Such returns shall
  be  in  such form and contain such other information as the commissioner
  shall require. In addition, such commissioner  shall  be  authorized  to
  require  by  regulation  the  keeping  of  records  and  the  filing  of
  information returns or reports by any person  registered  as  the  owner
  under  the vehicle and traffic law of a motor vehicle using diesel motor
  fuel which is operated on the public highways  of  this  state  and  the
  person  having  a  registration  issued pursuant to section four hundred
  fifteen of the vehicle and traffic law in the case of  a  motor  vehicle
  operated under such registration.
    3.   The   commissioner  shall  provide  for  the  filing  of  monthly
  information returns by every distributor and every person registered  as
  a  "retail  seller  of  aviation  gasoline"  required  to  maintain such
  records, as prescribed in subdivision one of this section,  which  shall
  in  all  material  respects  reflect  the  information  required  to  be
  contained in such records. Such  returns  shall  be  in  such  form  and
  contain  such  other  information  as  the  commissioner  shall require,
  provided, the commissioner shall permit the filing of such return  on  a


 quarterly  basis  by  distributors whose only sales of diesel motor fuel
  are sales to consumers solely for the purposes described in subparagraph
  (i) of paragraph  (b)  of  subdivision  three  of  section  two  hundred
  eighty-two-a  of  this  article  and  by  persons  registered under this
  article as distributors of kero-jet fuel only.




   §  286-a.  Records  and  reports  of  transportation of motor fuel and
  diesel motor fuel. Every person transporting motor fuel or diesel  motor
  fuel within this state, whether such transportation originates within or
  without this state, when required by the commissioner, shall keep a true
  and  accurate  record  of  all  motor  fuel  and  diesel  motor  fuel so
  transported,  including  ingredients  which  may  be   manufactured   or
  compounded into motor fuel or diesel motor fuel, showing such facts with
  relation  to  such  fuel and ingredients and their transportation as the
  commissioner may require. Such record shall be open to inspection by the
  representatives of the department at any time and the  commissioner  may
  require  from  any  such  person sworn returns of all or any part of the
  information shown by such records.




   §  286-b.  Transportation of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel; manifest
  required. 1. The master or other person in charge of any  barge,  tanker
  or  other  vessel  in  which  motor  fuel  or diesel motor fuel is being
  transported over any of the navigable waters of this state, the operator
  of a motor vehicle in which motor fuel or diesel  motor  fuel  is  being
  transported  in  this state, or the operator of a pipeline through which
  motor fuel or diesel motor fuel is  being  transported  in  this  state,
  other  than motor fuel or diesel motor fuel being transported for use in
  operating the engine which propels such vessel or motor vehicle, as  the
  case  may  be, must have in his or her possession a manifest which shows
  the name and address of the person from whom such fuel was  received  by
  him  or  her  and  the  place  of  receipt of such fuel and the name and
  address of every person to whom he or she is to  make  delivery  of  the
  same  and  the place of delivery, together with the number of gallons to
  be delivered to each such person, and, if such fuel  is  being  imported
  into  the  state  in  such  vessel,  motor  vehicle or pipeline for use,
  storage, distribution or sale in the state, the name of the  distributor
  importing  or  causing  such fuel to be imported into the state and such
  other information as the commissioner may require pursuant  to  rule  or
  regulation, and shall at the request of a peace officer, acting pursuant
  to  his  or  her special duties, a police officer, any representative of
  the department or any other person authorized by law to inquire into  or
  investigate  the  transportation of such fuel, produce such manifest for
  inspection. The person causing  the  operation  of  such  vessel,  motor
  vehicle  or  pipeline shall be responsible to cause the operator of such
  vessel, motor vehicle or pipeline to keep in his or  her  possession  on
  such  vessel,  in  such motor vehicle or in the main control building of
  such pipeline in this state the manifest required by this  section.  The
  absence  of  the  manifest required by this section shall give rise to a
  presumption that the motor fuel or diesel motor fuel  being  transported
  is  intended for sale, use, distribution or storage in this state and is
  being imported or caused to be  imported  by  other  than  a  registered
  distributor. Moreover, the absence of (1) the place of delivery of motor
  fuel  or diesel motor fuel on the manifest with respect to motor fuel or
  diesel motor fuel being imported into the state shall  give  rise  to  a
  presumption  that  such  fuel  is being imported into the state for use,
  distribution, storage or sale in  the  state  and  (2)  the  name  of  a
  registered  distributor  on  the  manifest with respect to motor fuel or
  diesel motor fuel being imported into the state for  use,  distribution,
  storage  or sale in the state shall give rise to a presumption that such
  fuel is being so imported or caused to  be  imported  by  other  than  a
  registered  distributor. Every barge, tanker or other vessel so used for
  the transportation of motor fuel must be plainly and visibly  marked  on
  both sides thereof and above the water line with the word "Gasoline," or
  other  name  of  the  motor  fuel being transported, in letters at least
  eight inches high and of corresponding appropriate  width,  or  must  be
  identified  as  prescribed  by  the  commissioner  pursuant  to  rule or
  regulation. The master or person in charge  of  such  barge,  tanker  or
  other  vessel,  as  well  as  the  owners  thereof, shall be guilty of a
  violation of this section if such barge, tanker or other vessel  is  not
  so marked.
    2.  The  commissioner  may,  by  regulation  provide  for the form and
  content of the manifest required for motor and diesel motor fuel and for
  the filing of monthly information returns by every  person  required  to
  maintain  records,  described  in subdivision one of this section, which
  shall in all material respects reflect the information  required  to  be
  contained  in  such  records.  Such  returns  shall  be in such form and
  contain such other information as the commissioner shall require.




   §  287.  Payment  of  tax;  returns. 1. Every distributor shall, on or
  before the twentieth day of each  month,  file  with  the  department  a
  return,  on  forms to be prescribed by the commissioner and furnished by
  such department, stating the number of gallons of motor  fuel  imported,
  manufactured  or  sold  by  such  distributor  in  the  state during the
  preceding calendar month and in the  case  of  Diesel  motor  fuel,  the
  number  of  gallons  of  Diesel  motor  fuel  imported and the number of
  gallons  which  have  been  sold  or  used.   Provided,   however,   the
  commissioner may, if he or she deems it necessary in order to ensure the
  payment of the taxes imposed by this article, require returns to be made
  at such times and covering such periods as he or she may deem necessary,
  and,  by regulation, may permit the filing of returns by distributors of
  Diesel motor fuel on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual  basis,  or  may
  waive  the  filing  of returns by a distributor of Diesel motor fuel for
  such time and upon such terms as he or she may deem proper if  satisfied
  that no tax imposed by this article with respect to Diesel motor fuel is
  or  will  be payable by him or her during the time for which returns are
  waived. Such returns shall  contain  such  further  information  as  the
  commissioner shall require. The fact that a distributor's name is signed
  to  a  filed  return shall be prima facie evidence for all purposes that
  the  return  was  actually  signed  by  such  distributor.   Each   such
  distributor  shall,  with  respect  to motor fuel, pay to the department
  with the filing of such return, the taxes imposed  by  this  article  on
  each  gallon  of  motor  fuel  imported,  manufactured  or  sold by such
  distributor in the state, and so reported, during the period covered  by
  such  return. Each distributor shall, with respect to Diesel motor fuel,
  pay to the department with the filing of the return the taxes imposed by
  this article on the number of gallons of Diesel motor fuel sold or  used
  or  delivered  to a filling station or delivered into the fuel tank of a
  motor vehicle  during  the  period  covered  by  the  return.  Provided,
  however,  that  where  a  distributor has purchased motor fuel or diesel
  motor fuel upon which the taxes imposed by this article have  been  paid
  or  paid  over  and in each instance the tax is included in the price, a
  credit shall be allowed for the amount of such taxes upon the subsequent
  sale of such fuel to the extent that such taxes are so paid and included
  in the price.
    2. A distributor entitled to a refund under the provisions of  section
  two  hundred  eighty-nine-c of this chapter, in lieu of such refund, may
  take credit therefor on a return filed pursuant to this section,  unless
  the commissioner shall withdraw such privilege.
    3.  Every  wholesaler  of motor fuel shall, on or before the twentieth
  day of  each  month,  file  with  the  department  a  return,  on  forms
  prescribed  by  the  commissioner stating the number of gallons of motor
  fuel purchased and sold by such  wholesaler  in  the  state  during  the
  preceding  calendar  month. For each purchase and sale, the date, number
  of gallons of motor fuel purchased or sold, and the name of  the  seller
  or  purchaser  shall  be  set  forth  on  the return. Such returns shall
  contain such further information as the commissioner shall require.  The
  fact that a wholesaler's name is signed to a filed return shall be prima
  facie  evidence  for all purposes that the return was actually signed by
  such wholesaler of motor fuel.




   §  288.  Determination  of tax. 1. (a) Except as otherwise provided in
  this section, if a distributor files a return under  this  article,  but
  such return is incorrect or insufficient, the state tax commission shall
  determine the amount of tax due at any time within three years after the
  return  was  filed (whether or not such return was filed on or after the
  due date),  and  give  written  notice  of  such  determination  to  the
  distributor.    For  the  purposes  of this section the term distributor
  shall also include any other person liable for the taxes imposed by this
  article.
    (b) The tax commission shall determine the liability for  the  penalty
  imposed  by  subdivision two of section two hundred eighty-nine-b of any
  officer, director, shareholder or employee of  a  corporation  or  of  a
  dissolved  corporation,  member or employee of a partnership or employee
  of an individual proprietorship. The tax commission shall also determine
  the amount of such penalty. All of the provisions of this section  shall
  apply  to any determination made pursuant to this paragraph and for such
  purpose the term distributor, as used in subdivisions four, five and six
  of this section, shall also mean and  include  such  officer,  director,
  shareholder, employee or member as the case may be.
    (c)  The  tax commission shall determine the liability for the penalty
  imposed by paragraph (e) of  subdivision  one  of  section  two  hundred
  eighty-nine-b  of  any  person as an owner of a filling station. The tax
  commission shall also determine the amount of such penalty. All  of  the
  provisions  of  this  section  shall  apply  to  any  determination made
  pursuant to this paragraph and for such purpose the term distributor, as
  used in subdivisions four, five and six of this section, shall also mean
  and include such person.
    (d) The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subdivision shall
  not be construed to limit in any  manner  the  powers  of  the  attorney
  general under subdivision one of section two hundred eighty-nine of this
  chapter  or  the  powers  of the tax commission to issue a warrant under
  subdivision two of such section against any person whose  liability  has
  become finally and irrevocably fixed.
    2. The state tax commission may determine the amount of tax due at any
  time  if  such  distributor  (i)  has not registered as required by this
  article, (ii) fails to file a return, (iii) files a willfully  false  or
  fraudulent  return with intent to evade the tax, or (iv) fails to comply
  with section two hundred eighty-three of this article in  not  informing
  the  department,  in  writing,  of  any  change in its address and, if a
  corporation or partnership, in not informing the department, in writing,
  of any change in its officers, directors or partners or their  residence
  addresses as shown in its application for registration.
    3.  If  a  distributor shall inform the department, in writing, of any
  change in its address and, if a corporation or partnership shall  inform
  the  department, in writing, of any change in its officers, directors or
  partners or their residence addresses as shown in  its  application  for
  registration,  the determination of the amount of tax due may be made at
  any time within three years after such information is received.
    4. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions  of  this  section,
  where,  before the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for
  the determination of tax, both the tax commission  and  the  distributor
  have  consented in writing to its determination after such time, the tax
  may be determined at any time prior to  the  expiration  of  the  period
  agreed  upon.    The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent
  agreements  in  writing  made  before  the  expiration  of  the   period
  previously agreed upon.
    5.  Any  determination made pursuant to this section shall finally and
  irrevocably fix the tax  unless  the  distributor  against  whom  it  is


 assessed  shall,  within  ninety days after the giving of notice of such
  determination, petition the division of tax appeals for  a  hearing,  or
  unless the commissioner of taxation and finance of his own motion, shall
  redetermine  the same.   After such hearing, the division of tax appeals
  shall give notice of the determination of the administrative  law  judge
  to  the  distributor  liable  for  the  tax  and  to the commissioner of
  taxation and finance. Such determination may  be  reviewed  by  the  tax
  appeals  tribunal  as  provided  in  article  forty of this chapter. The
  decision of the tax appeals tribunal may  be  reviewed  as  provided  in
  section two thousand sixteen of this chapter, but the proceeding may not
  be  commenced  unless  the  amount  of  tax stated or referred to in the
  decision, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, and the amount of
  any other penalty stated or referred to in the decision shall have  been
  first  deposited  with  the commissioner of taxation and finance, and an
  undertaking filed with him, in such amount and with such sureties  as  a
  justice  of  the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such
  proceeding be dismissed or the decision confirmed, the  petitioner  will
  pay  all  costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  against  him  in  the
  prosecution of the proceeding, or at the option of the  petitioner  such
  undertaking  may  be  in  a  sum sufficient to cover the tax, penalties,
  interest, costs and charges aforesaid, in  which  event  the  petitioner
  shall  not  be  required  to  pay  such tax, penalties and interest as a
  condition precedent to the commencement of the proceeding.
    6. The remedy provided by this section for review of a decision of the
  tax appeals tribunal shall be the  exclusive  remedy  available  to  any
  taxpayer  to  judicially  determine  the  liability of such taxpayer for
  taxes under this article.




   § 288-a. Jeopardy assessments. If the tax commission believes that the
  collection  of any tax will be jeopardized by delay it may determine the
  amount of such tax and assess the same, together with all  interest  and
  penalties  provided  by law, against any person liable therefor prior to
  the filing of his return and prior  to  the  date  when  his  return  is
  required  to  be  filed.  The  amount so determined shall become due and
  payable to the tax commission by the person against whom such a jeopardy
  assessment is made, as soon as notice thereof is given to him personally
  or by registered or  certified  mail.  The  provisions  of  section  two
  hundred   eighty-eight   of   this  article  shall  apply  to  any  such
  determination except to the extent that they may  be  inconsistent  with
  the  provisions  of  this  section.  The  tax commission shall abate any
  jeopardy assessment if it  finds  that  jeopardy  does  not  exist.  The
  collection  of  any jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing with the
  tax commission a bond issued by a surety company authorized to  transact
  business  in  this state and approved by the superintendent of financial
  services as to solvency  and  responsibility,  or  such  other  security
  acceptable to the tax commission, conditioned upon payment of the amount
  assessed  and  interest  thereon,  or  any  lesser  amount to which such
  assessment may be reduced by the tax commission or by a proceeding under
  article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules as provided in
  section two hundred eighty-eight of this article,  such  payment  to  be
  made when the assessment or any such reduction thereof shall have become
  final  and  not  subject  to further review. If such a bond is filed and
  thereafter a proceeding under  article  seventy-eight  is  commenced  as
  provided in subdivision five of section two hundred eighty-eight of this
  article, deposit of the taxes, penalties and interest assessed shall not
  be  required  as  a  condition  precedent  to  the  commencement of such
  proceeding. Where a jeopardy assessment is made, any property seized for
  the collection of the tax shall not be sold (1) until expiration of  the
  time  to  apply  for  a  hearing  as  provided  in  section  two hundred
  eighty-eight of this article, and (2)  if  such  application  is  timely
  filed,  until the expiration of four months after the tax commission has
  given notice of  its  determination  to  the  person  against  whom  the
  assessment  is made; provided, however, such property may be sold at any
  time if such person has failed to attend a hearing of which he has  been
  duly  notified,  or if he consents to the sale, or if the tax commission
  determines that  the  expenses  of  conservation  and  maintenance  will
  greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property is perishable.




   § 289. Proceedings to recover tax. Whenever any distributor shall fail
  to  pay, within the time limited herein, any tax which he is required to
  pay under the provisions of this article,  the  attorney-general  shall,
  upon  the  request  of  the  department of taxation and finance, enforce
  payment of such tax by civil action in the supreme court, in the name of
  the people of the state, against such distributor for the amount of such
  tax, with interest. The proceeds of the judgment, if any, shall be  paid
  to the department of taxation and finance.
    Whenever  any  distributor  shall fail to pay, within the time limited
  herein, any tax which he is required to pay under the provisions of this
  article, the tax commission may issue a warrant under its official seal,
  directed to the sheriff of any county of the state,  commanding  him  to
  levy  upon  and sell the real and personal property of such distributor,
  found within his county, for the payment of the amount thereof, with the
  added penalties, interest and the cost of executing the warrant, and  to
  return such warrant to the department of taxation and finance and to pay
  to  it the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the
  receipt of such warrant. The sheriff shall within five  days  after  the
  receipt  of  the  warrant,  file  with  the  clerk  of his county a copy
  thereof, and thereupon the clerk shall enter in the judgment docket  the
  name  of the distributor mentioned in the warrant, and the amount of the
  tax, penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date
  when such copy is filed, and thereupon the amount  of  such  warrant  so
  docketed  shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and
  personal property of the distributor against whom the warrant is issued.
  Such lien shall not apply to personal property unless  such  warrant  is
  also  filed in the department of state. The said sheriff shall thereupon
  proceed upon the warrant in all respects, with like effect, and  in  the
  same  manner  prescribed  by law in respect to executions issued against
  property upon judgments of a court of record, and shall be  entitled  to
  the same fees for his services in executing the warrant, to be collected
  in the same manner. In the discretion of the tax commission a warrant of
  like  terms,  force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer
  or employee of the department  of  taxation  and  finance,  and  in  the
  execution  thereof  such  officer  or employee shall have all the powers
  conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall  be  entitled  to  no  fee  or
  compensation  in  excess  of  actual expenses paid in the performance of
  such duty. Upon such filing of a copy of a warrant, the  tax  commission
  shall  have  the same remedies to enforce the claim for taxes, penalties
  and interest against the distributor as if the people of the  state  had
  recovered judgment against such distributor for the amount of the tax.




   §  289-a.    Tax to be paid but once; foreign and interstate commerce;
  injunction.  Nothing in this article shall be construed to  require  the
  payment  to the department of taxation and finance of such tax more than
  once on any quantity of motor fuel sold within the state.  No  provision
  of  this  article  shall  apply  or  be construed to apply to foreign or
  interstate commerce, except in so far  as  the  same  may  be  effective
  pursuant  to  the  United  States constitution and to laws of the United
  States  enacted  pursuant  thereto.    The  supreme  court  shall   have
  jurisdiction  to restrain the department, by injunction, from collecting
  a tax under this article upon any sale as to which,  by  reason  of  the
  United  States  constitution  and  the laws of the United States enacted
  pursuant thereto, such a tax cannot be imposed.




   §  289-b. Penalties and interest. 1. (a) A distributor or other person
  who or which fails to file a return or to pay any tax  within  the  time
  required  by  or pursuant to this article (determined with regard to any
  extension of time for filing or paying) shall be subject to a penalty of
  ten per centum of the amount of tax determined to be due as provided  in
  this  article  plus  one  per  centum  of  such amount for each month or
  fraction  thereof  during  which  such  failure  continues   after   the
  expiration of the first month after such return was required to be filed
  or  such  tax  became  due,  not  exceeding  thirty  per  centum  in the
  aggregate. Provided, however, in the case of  a  failure  to  file  such
  return  within  sixty  days  of  the  date prescribed for filing of such
  return by or pursuant to this article (determined  with  regard  to  any
  extension  of  time  for  filing), the penalty imposed by this paragraph
  shall not be less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or one  hundred
  per centum of the amount required to be shown as tax on such return. For
  the  purpose of the preceding sentence, the amount of tax required to be
  shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any  part  of  the
  tax  which  is  paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the
  tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed
  upon the return.
    (b) If any amount of tax is not  paid  on  or  before  the  last  date
  prescribed  in  this article for payment, interest on such amount at the
  underpayment rate set  by  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance
  pursuant  to subdivision twenty-sixth of section one hundred seventy-one
  of this chapter shall be paid for the period from such last date to  the
  date paid, whether or not any extension of time for payment was granted.
  Interest under this paragraph shall not be paid if the amount thereof is
  less than one dollar.
    (c)  If  the  tax commission determines that such failure or delay was
  due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, it  shall  remit
  all  or  part of such penalty. The tax commission shall promulgate rules
  and regulations as to what constitutes reasonable cause.
    (d) If the failure to pay any tax  within  the  time  required  by  or
  pursuant  to  this article is due to fraud, in lieu of the penalties and
  interest provided for in paragraphs (a) and  (b)  of  this  subdivision,
  there shall be added to the tax (i) a penalty of two times the amount of
  tax  due, plus (ii) interest on such unpaid tax at the underpayment rate
  set by the commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to  subdivision
  twenty-sixth  of section one hundred seventy-one of this chapter for the
  period beginning on the last day prescribed  by  this  article  for  the
  payment  of such tax (determined without regard to any extension of time
  for paying) and ending on the day on which such tax is paid.
    (e) Any owner of a filling station who shall willfully  and  knowingly
  have  in  his custody, possession or under his control any motor fuel or
  Diesel motor fuel on which (i) the taxes imposed by or pursuant  to  the
  authority of this article have not been assumed or paid by a distributor
  registered  as  such  under this article or (ii) the taxes imposed by or
  pursuant to the authority of this article, which taxes were required  to
  have  been passed through to him and included in the cost to him of such
  fuel, have not been included in the cost to him of such  fuel  shall  be
  liable  for a penalty equal to twice the amount of tax so not assumed or
  paid, or included. Such penalty shall be determined, assessed, collected
  and paid in the same manner as taxes imposed by this article and all the
  provisions of this article relating to determination of tax, proceedings
  to recover tax, refunds (but only of  monies  paid  in  error),  mailing
  rules  and  disposition  of revenue shall be deemed also to refer to the
  penalty imposed by this paragraph and, for this purpose, the term "owner
  of a filling station" shall be substituted for  the  term  "distributor"


 wherever appearing in such provisions. Such penalty may be determined at
  any  time  within three years after such motor fuel or Diesel motor fuel
  shall have come into the custody, possession or control of such owner of
  a  filling  station.  For  purposes  of this paragraph, such owner shall
  willfully and knowingly have in his custody,  possession  or  under  his
  control any motor fuel or Diesel motor fuel (1) on which such taxes have
  not  been  assumed or paid by a distributor registered as such or (2) on
  which such taxes are required to have been passed  through  to  him  and
  have  not  been  included  in  his cost when such owner has known of the
  requirement that such taxes be so included and where  to  his  knowledge
  such taxes have not been so included. For purposes of this paragraph, it
  shall  be  presumptive  evidence  that  such  owner  shall willfully and
  knowingly have in his custody, possession or under his control any motor
  fuel or Diesel motor fuel (1) on which such taxes have not been  assumed
  or  paid  by a distributor registered as such or (2) on which such taxes
  are required to have been passed  through  to  him  and  have  not  been
  included in his cost where such owner has not received the certification
  required  by  subdivision three of section two hundred eighty-five-a or,
  in the case of Diesel motor fuel, by subdivision  four  of  section  two
  hundred  eighty-five-b  of  this article at the time of delivery of such
  motor fuel or Diesel motor fuel, or, in those  circumstances  where  the
  commissioner  has authorized the delivery of the certification at a time
  after delivery of the motor fuel or  Diesel  motor  fuel,  at  the  time
  prescribed by the commissioner.
    (e-1)  In  addition to any other penalties that may be imposed by law,
  any of the following penalties may be imposed.
    (i) Any person who fails to file an informational  return  under  this
  article  on or before the prescribed date, must pay a penalty of fifteen
  hundred dollars for the first violation and a penalty of three  thousand
  dollars  for each subsequent violation, unless it can be shown that such
  failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.
    (ii) Any person who fails to file an informational return within sixty
  days of the date prescribed  for  filing  must  pay  a  penalty  of  two
  thousand  dollars for the first violation and a penalty of four thousand
  dollars for each subsequent violation, unless it can be shown that  such
  failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.
    (iii)  Any  person  who  fails to file a complete informational return
  must pay a penalty of fifteen hundred dollars for  the  first  violation
  and  a  penalty of three thousand dollars for each subsequent violation,
  unless it can be shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause  and
  not willful neglect.
    (iv)  If  any person makes a statement on an informational return and,
  as of the time of the statement, there was no reasonable basis for  that
  statement,  that  person  must pay a penalty of two thousand dollars for
  the first violation and a penalty of  four  thousand  dollars  for  each
  subsequent violation.
    (f)  The  penalties and interest provided for in this section shall be
  determined, assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as the taxes
  imposed by this article and shall be disposed of as hereinafter provided
  with respect to moneys  derived  from  the  tax.  Unpaid  penalties  and
  interest under this subdivision may be recovered by the attorney-general
  by  action in the name of the people, and all penalties and interest due
  from the same distributor may be sued for in one action. Interest  under
  this subdivision shall be compounded daily.
    2.  Any officer, director, shareholder or employee of a corporation or
  of a dissolved  corporation,  any  employee  of  a  partnership  or  any
  employee of an individual proprietorship, who as such officer, director,
  shareholder  or  employee  is  under a duty to act for such corporation,


 partnership or proprietorship in complying with any requirement of  this
  article,  and  any member of a partnership, which fails to pay the taxes
  imposed by or pursuant to this article,  shall,  in  addition  to  other
  penalties  provided  by  law,  be liable to a penalty equal to the total
  amount of the  tax  not  paid,  plus  penalties  and  interest  computed
  pursuant  to  subdivision  one  of this section as if such person were a
  distributor. If the tax commission determines that such failure was  due
  to  reasonable  cause and not due to willful neglect, it shall remit all
  or part of such penalty imposed under  this  subdivision.  Such  penalty
  shall  be determined, assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as
  the  taxes  imposed  by  this  article  and  shall  be  disposed  of  as
  hereinafter provided with respect to moneys derived from the tax.
    3. For purposes of this chapter, the failure to do any act required by
  or under the provisions of this article shall be deemed an act committed
  in  part  at  the  office  of  the department of taxation and finance in
  Albany. For purposes  of  this  chapter,  the  certificate  of  the  tax
  commission to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that a return has
  not  been  filed, or that information has not been supplied, as required
  by or under the provisions of this article, or that a claim  for  refund
  has been filed, shall be prima facie evidence that such tax has not been
  paid, that such return has not been filed, that such information has not
  been supplied, or that such claim has been filed.
    4.  Cross-reference:  For criminal penalties, see article thirty-seven
  of this chapter.
    5. (a) Any purchaser of Diesel motor fuel who knowingly issues a false
  or fraudulent exempt transaction  certificate  (or  a  similar  document
  which  has  been prescribed by the commissioner of taxation and finance)
  or interdistributor sale certificate in order to claim an exemption from
  the taxes imposed on Diesel motor fuel by this article by reason  of  an
  exemption from tax provided for in paragraph (b) of subdivision three of
  section  two hundred eighty-two-a of this article, shall, in addition to
  liability for tax or any other  penalty  imposed  by  this  chapter,  be
  subject  to  a penalty of one hundred percent of the tax liability which
  would have resulted if there had not been a misuse of such certificate.
    (b) Any seller of Diesel motor  fuel  who  knowingly  accepts  from  a
  purchaser  a  false  or  fraudulent exempt transaction certificate (or a
  similar document which  has  been  prescribed  by  the  commissioner  of
  taxation  and finance) or interdistributor sale certificate which claims
  an exemption from the taxes imposed on Diesel motor fuel by this article
  by reason of the exemption from tax provided for in such  paragraph  (b)
  of subdivision three of section two hundred eighty-two-a of this article
  shall,  in addition to liability for tax or any other penalty imposed by
  this chapter, be subject to a penalty of one hundred percent of the  tax
  liability  which would have resulted if such certificate had not been so
  accepted.




   § 289-c. Refunds. 1. The tax imposed by this article though payable by
  the  distributor,  shall  be borne by the purchaser and when paid by the
  distributor shall be deemed to have been so paid for the account of  the
  purchaser.  No  person  shall  sell,  advertise, or offer for sale motor
  fuel, separate from the tax herein imposed; and the price  paid  by  the
  purchaser  for  motor fuel on which the tax has been paid, if such price
  be not less than the amount of the tax thereon, shall  be  presumed  for
  the purposes of this section to have included the tax.
    1-a. (a) Any person selling motor fuel to an organization described in
  paragraph  one  or  two  of  subdivision  (a)  of section eleven hundred
  sixteen of this chapter or a  hospital  included  in  the  organizations
  described  in  paragraph  four  of  such  subdivision for its own use or
  consumption or selling kero-jet fuel  to  an  airline  for  use  in  its
  airplanes  may  exclude  the  amount of the tax or taxes imposed by this
  article from the selling price thereof.
    (b) (i) Any person registered as a distributor of motor  fuel  selling
  aviation gasoline to a fixed base operator registered under this article
  as  a "retail seller of aviation gasoline" may exclude the amount of the
  tax or taxes imposed by this article  from  the  selling  price  thereof
  where  such  aviation gasoline is delivered to the fixed base operator's
  premises and placed in a  storage  facility  used  exclusively  for  the
  purpose of fueling airplanes. The commissioner may register as a "retail
  seller of aviation gasoline" a fixed base operator who makes no sales of
  aviation gasoline other than retail sales not in bulk delivered directly
  into  the  fuel tank of an airplane and who makes no sales of motor fuel
  other than the foregoing described retail  sales  of  aviation  gasoline
  delivered  directly  into  the  fuel  tank of airplanes (provided, in no
  event, shall kero-jet fuel be construed to constitute motor fuel).  Such
  registration shall apply only to the wholesale purchase of only aviation
  gasoline  by  such  "retail  seller of aviation gasoline" and the retail
  sale by such person of  aviation  gasoline  not  in  bulk  for  delivery
  directly  into  the  fuel  tank  of an airplane for use in the operation
  thereof. In no event shall the  registration  as  a  "retail  seller  of
  aviation  gasoline" be deemed to be an authorization to import, or cause
  to be imported, motor fuel including aviation gasoline, into this state.
  All  the  provisions  of  section  two  hundred  eighty-three-a  (except
  subdivision one) of this article shall be applicable to the registration
  of  "retail sellers of aviation gasoline" with the same force and effect
  as if the language of such section had been incorporated in full  herein
  and  had  expressly  referred  to the registration of "retail sellers of
  aviation gasoline", with such modification as may be necessary in  order
  to  adapt  the language so as to apply to the registration of applicants
  for and persons registered as "retail  sellers  of  aviation  gasoline".
  Provided,  however,  that  if the commissioner is satisfied that certain
  requirements of such foregoing provisions with respect  to  registration
  are not necessary in order to protect tax revenues, the commissioner may
  waive,   limit   or   modify  such  requirements  with  respect  to  the
  registration of "retail sellers of aviation gasoline".  The  department,
  where applicable, shall coordinate the registration process with respect
  to  a  fixed base operator applying for registration as a "retail seller
  of aviation gasoline" and as a distributor of kero-jet  fuel  only  with
  the  purpose  of  eliminating  any duplicative information or procedures
  required of the applicant. Every person registered as a  "retail  seller
  of  aviation  gasoline"  shall  keep  complete  and  accurate records of
  purchases and sales of aviation gasoline (including individual  invoices
  identifying each purchase or sale of aviation gasoline) to and from such
  "retail  seller  of aviation gasoline". The commissioner shall, if it is
  determined to be appropriate, establish a requirement that a certificate


 be given by a "retail seller of aviation gasoline" prior to the sale  of
  aviation gasoline pursuant to this paragraph.
    (ii)  Any  person  registered  as a distributor of motor fuel and also
  registered as a "retail seller of aviation  gasoline"  may  exclude  the
  amount  of  the  tax  or  taxes imposed by this article from the selling
  price thereof on such retail sale of aviation gasoline.
    (c) (i) Any person making a sale of motor fuel under the circumstances
  described in paragraph (a), or subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of this
  subdivision  or  making  a  sale  of  Diesel  motor   fuel   under   the
  circumstances  described  in  subdivision  four  of  section two hundred
  eighty-two-a of this article whereby the tax or taxes  imposed  by  this
  article  have not been passed through to the purchaser, shall be allowed
  a refund or credit of the tax or taxes imposed by this  article  in  the
  amount  of  such  tax or taxes paid by such person on such motor fuel or
  Diesel motor fuel being sold or included  in  the  price  paid  by  such
  person  for such fuel. Claims for refunds or credits shall be presented,
  and refunds or  credits  shall  be  made,  only  as  authorized  by  the
  commissioner under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe.
    (ii) Any airline registered as a distributor of motor fuel who imports
  aviation  gasoline  into  this  state  for  use  in  its airplanes and a
  distributor described in subparagraph (ii)  of  paragraph  (b)  of  this
  subdivision  shall  be  allowed  a  refund or credit of the tax or taxes
  imposed by this article in the amount of such tax or taxes paid by  such
  person on such aviation gasoline so imported and used exclusively in the
  operation  of  its  airplanes.  The refund or credit shall accrue at the
  time the aviation gasoline is delivered  and  stored  as  prescribed  in
  subparagraph  (i)  of  paragraph  (b)  of  this  subdivision. Claims for
  refunds or credits shall be presented and refunds or  credits  shall  be
  made only as authorized by the commissioner, including documentary proof
  required to substantiate refund claims.
    * (d)(i) Any person may exclude the amount of the tax or taxes imposed
  by  this  article  on  E85  from  the selling price thereof where E85 is
  delivered to a filling station and placed in  a  storage  tank  of  such
  filling  station  for  such  E85  to  be dispensed directly into a motor
  vehicle for use in the operation of such vehicle. Any  person  making  a
  sale of E85 under the circumstances described herein, whereby the tax or
  taxes  otherwise imposed by this article have not been passed through to
  the purchaser, shall be allowed a refund or credit of the taxes  imposed
  by  this  article in the amount of such tax or taxes paid by such person
  on such E85 being sold or included in the price paid by such person  for
  such fuel. Claims for refunds or credits shall be presented, and refunds
  or  credits  shall be made, only as authorized by the commissioner under
  such rules and regulations as the commissioner may prescribe.
    (ii) Any person may exclude twenty percent of the amount of the tax or
  taxes imposed by this article from the selling price with respect to any
  sale of B20. Any person making a sale of B20 upon which such person does
  not pass on more than eighty percent of the taxes otherwise  imposed  by
  this  article,  where such person has purchased such B20 with the entire
  amount of the taxes imposed by this article included  in  such  person's
  purchase  price,  shall  be  entitled to a refund or credit equal to the
  amount of the tax or taxes paid under this article on such B20 in excess
  of eighty percent of the tax or taxes imposed by this article on  diesel
  motor  fuel.  Claims  for  refunds  or  credits  shall be presented, and
  refunds or credits shall be made, only as authorized by the commissioner
  under such rules and regulations as the commissioner may prescribe.
    (iii) Any person may exclude the amount of the tax or taxes imposed by
  this article on CNG or hydrogen from  the  selling  price  thereof.  Any
  person  making  a  sale  of  CNG  or  hydrogen, whereby the tax or taxes


 otherwise imposed by this article have not been passed  through  to  the
  purchaser,  shall  be allowed a refund or credit of any taxes imposed by
  this article in the amount of such tax or taxes paid by such  person  on
  such  CNG  or  hydrogen being sold or included in the price paid by such
  person for such CNG or hydrogen. Claims for refunds or credits shall  be
  presented,  and  refunds or credits shall be made, only as authorized by
  the commissioner under such rules and regulations  as  the  commissioner
  may prescribe.
    * NB Repealed September 1, 2026
    2.  However,  the  intention  of this article is to place the ultimate
  burden resulting from such tax, so far as possible, on persons  who  use
  the  public  highways of the state for operating motor vehicles thereon,
  or who use the waterways of the  state  including  any  other  waterways
  bordering  on  the  state  for  operating pleasure or recreational motor
  boats thereon, and the following  refunds  are  provided  to  that  end,
  subject to the provisions of subdivision five of this section.
    3.  (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section,
  any person who shall buy any motor fuel or diesel motor fuel,  on  which
  the  tax imposed by this article shall have been paid, and shall consume
  the same in any manner except in the operation of a motor  vehicle  upon
  or  over  the  public  highways  of this state, or in the operation of a
  pleasure or recreational motor boat upon or over the  waterways  of  the
  state  including  waterways  bordering on the state, shall be reimbursed
  the amount of such tax in the  manner  and  subject  to  the  conditions
  herein  provided except that there shall be no reimbursement of tax paid
  on motor fuel or diesel motor fuel taken out of this  state  in  a  fuel
  tank  connected  with the engine of a motor vehicle and consumed outside
  of this state.
    (b) Any omnibus carrier which shall buy any motor fuel  on  which  the
  aggregate tax imposed by section two hundred eighty-four and section two
  hundred eighty-four-a of this chapter, or any diesel motor fuel on which
  the  aggregate  tax  imposed  by  section  two  hundred eighty-two-a and
  section two hundred eighty-two-b of this chapter, shall have been  paid,
  shall  be  reimbursed,  in  the case of such motor fuel, the amount paid
  pursuant to such  sections  two  hundred  eighty-four  and  two  hundred
  eighty-four-a  in  excess  of  four cents per gallon, and in the case of
  diesel motor fuel, the amount paid pursuant to such sections two hundred
  eighty-two-a and two hundred eighty-two-b in excess  of  six  cents  per
  gallon,  provided such motor fuel or diesel motor fuel has been consumed
  by such carrier in the operation  of  an  omnibus  in  this  state.  Any
  taxicab  licensee,  as defined by subdivision ten of section two hundred
  eighty-two of this chapter, who or which shall buy  any  motor  fuel  on
  which  the  aggregate tax imposed by section two hundred eighty-four and
  section two hundred eighty-four-a of this chapter or  any  diesel  motor
  fuel  on  which  the  aggregate  tax  imposed  by  section  two  hundred
  eighty-two-a and section two hundred eighty-two-b of this chapter, shall
  have been paid, shall be reimbursed, in the case of such motor fuel, the
  amount paid pursuant to such sections two hundred  eighty-four  and  two
  hundred  eighty-four-a  in  excess  of four cents per gallon, and in the
  case of diesel motor fuel, the amount paid pursuant to such sections two
  hundred eighty-two-a and two hundred eighty-two-b in excess of six cents
  per gallon, provided such motor fuel or diesel fuel has been consumed by
  such licensee in the operation of a taxicab in this state.
    (c) All claims for reimbursement shall be in  such  form  and  contain
  such  information as the commissioner shall prescribe and shall be filed
  within three years from (i) the date of the purchase, in the case of the
  purchaser; or (ii) the date of the sale, in the case of the  seller,  of
  the  motor  fuel  so  subject  to  reimbursement. Every such claim shall


 include a certificate by or on behalf of the party presenting  the  same
  to  the  effect  that it is just, true and correct, that no part thereof
  has been paid, except as stated therein, and that  the  balance  therein
  stated  is  actually  due  and  owing.  The  claimant  shall satisfy the
  department that the claimant has borne the tax and that the  motor  fuel
  has  been  consumed by the claimant in a manner other than the operation
  of a motor vehicle upon or over the public highways of this  state,  the
  operation  of  a  pleasure  or  recreational  motorboat upon or over the
  waterways of the state including waterways bordering on the state or, in
  the case of an  omnibus  carrier,  taxicab  licensee,  nonpublic  school
  operator or volunteer ambulance service, that the claimant has borne the
  tax  and  that the amount claimed is the amount of such tax reimbursable
  under paragraph (b), (d), (e) or (f) of this subdivision. The department
  may require such further information or proof as it shall deem necessary
  for the administration of such claim. Claims for reimbursement  approved
  by  the  department  shall  be  paid  from revenues collected under this
  article and deposited to the credit of the  comptroller  as  hereinafter
  provided;  but  no  such  claims  shall be paid unless the department is
  satisfied that the amount of the tax  for  which  the  reimbursement  is
  claimed  has  actually  been  collected  by the state. The amount of any
  erroneous or excessive payment to a claimant for  reimbursement  may  be
  determined  by the department and may be recovered from such claimant in
  the same manner as a tax imposed by  this  article,  provided,  however,
  that  any  such determination shall be made within three years after the
  date of such erroneous or excessive payment.
    (d) Any omnibus carrier which  shall  buy  motor  fuel  on  which  the
  aggregate  tax  imposed  by section two hundred eighty-four, section two
  hundred eighty-four-a and section  two  hundred  eighty-four-c  of  this
  chapter  or  any diesel motor fuel on which the aggregate tax imposed by
  section two hundred eighty-two-a, section two hundred  eighty-two-b  and
  section  two  hundred eighty-two-c of this chapter shall have been paid,
  shall be reimbursed the amount paid provided such motor fuel  or  diesel
  motor  fuel  has  been  consumed  by such carrier in the operation of an
  omnibus in local transit service in this state pursuant to a certificate
  of  convenience  and   necessity   issued   by   the   commissioner   of
  transportation of this state or by the interstate commerce commission of
  the  United  States  or  pursuant  to  a  contract, franchise or consent
  between such carrier and a city having a population  of  more  than  one
  million inhabitants, or any agency of such city.
    (e)  Any nonpublic school operator which shall buy motor fuel on which
  the aggregate tax imposed by section two  hundred  eighty-four,  section
  two  hundred eighty-four-a and section two hundred eighty-four-c of this

  section  two  hundred eighty-two-a, section two hundred eighty-two-b and
  section two hundred eighty-two-c of this chapter shall have  been  paid,
  shall  be  reimbursed the amount paid provided such motor fuel or diesel
  motor  fuel  has  been  consumed  by  such  nonpublic  school   operator
  exclusively in educational related activities.
    (f)  Any  voluntary  ambulance  service,  as defined in section thirty
  hundred one of the public health law, which  shall  buy  motor  fuel  on
  which  the  tax  or  taxes  imposed by this article shall have been paid
  shall be reimbursed the amount of such tax in the manner and subject  to
  the  conditions  herein  set  forth,  provided  such motor fuel has been
  consumed by such volunteer ambulance service vehicle in  the  course  of
  operating within the state.
    (g)  An  organization described in paragraph one or two of subdivision
  (a) of section eleven hundred sixteen of  this  chapter  or  a  hospital
  included  in  the  organizations  described  in  paragraph  four of such


 subdivision, or a fire company or fire department, as defined in section
  three of the volunteer firefighters' benefit law, or a volunteer  rescue
  squad  supported  in whole or in part by tax money where any such entity
  is the purchaser, user or consumer of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel in
  a  vehicle  owned  and  operated  by  it  and  used  exclusively for its
  purposes, or an airline where it has purchased kero-jet fuel for use  in
  its  airplanes shall be reimbursed the amount of the taxes on motor fuel
  and diesel motor fuel imposed by or pursuant to the  authority  of  this
  article  included  in the price paid for such motor fuel or diesel motor
  fuel.
    (h) Notwithstanding any provision of the law to the contrary, tax paid
  pursuant to this article in respect to motor fuel or diesel  motor  fuel
  purchased  by a government entity and paid for by such government entity

  credit card used for such purchase or the fuel distributor designated in
  accordance with and subject to the provisions of sections eleven hundred
  thirty-eight,  eleven hundred thirty-nine, eleven hundred forty-two, and
  eleven hundred forty-five of this chapter concerning  such  credit  card
  issuers,  fuel  distributors  and  government  entities. Such provisions
  shall apply with respect to the administration  of  and  procedure  with
  respect  to  the taxes imposed under this article in the same manner and
  with the same force and effect as if the language of such provisions had
  been incorporated in full into this article and had  expressly  referred
  to  the  tax  under  this  article,  with  such  modifications as may be
  necessary in order to adapt the language of such provisions to the taxes
  imposed by this article, except to the extent that any such provision is
  not relevant to this article.
    5. If the provisions of this section providing  for  reimbursement  of
  the  amount  of  the  tax  paid  be  held unconstitutional by a court of
  competent jurisdiction, the  other  constitutional  provisions  of  this
  article  nevertheless shall stand, it being the express intention of the
  legislature that even though such provision for  reimbursement  be  held
  unconstitutional  the tax provided for by this article shall be imposed,
  collected and distributed as provided in  this  article,  regardless  in
  that event of the manner in which the motor fuel is consumed.
    6.  Moneys  paid  in  error  under this article may be refunded. Where
  motor fuel, upon which the tax imposed by this article has been paid, is
  sold, under such circumstances that, if the tax had not been  paid,  the
  sale  would  not  have  been  taxable under this article, the tax may be
  refunded.  Refunds shall be made only as authorized by the  commissioner
  under  such  rules  and  regulations  as  the commissioner may prescribe
  provided an application therefor is filed with the  commissioner  within
  three  years  from  the time the erroneous payment was made, or tax paid
  motor fuel was so sold. Refunds authorized by the commissioner shall  be
  paid  from  revenues  collected  under this article and deposited to the
  credit of the comptroller as hereinafter provided.
    7. If an  agreement  under  the  provisions  of  section  two  hundred
  eighty-eight  (extending  the period for determination of tax imposed by
  this article) is made within the three-year period for the filing of  an
  application  for refund under subdivision six of this section or, in the
  case of a claim  for  reimbursement  under  subdivision  three  of  this
  section,  if  such agreement is made within three years from the date of
  purchase or sale (as the case may be) of the motor fuel, the period  for
  filing  an application for refund or a claim for reimbursement shall not
  expire prior to six months after the expiration  of  the  period  within
  which  determination  may  be  made  pursuant  to  the  agreement or any
  extension thereof.


   8. With respect to  motor  fuel  imported,  manufactured  or  sold  or
  purchased  in  this state, and with respect to the sale or use of Diesel
  motor fuel, a refund or credit shall  be  allowed  a  distributor  or  a
  purchaser  of  the tax required to be paid pursuant to this article upon
  such  motor  fuel or Diesel motor fuel in the amount of such tax paid by
  or included in the price paid by a distributor or such purchaser to  the
  seller thereof if such fuel was exported from this state for sale or use
  outside  this state, such distributor or such purchaser, as the case may
  be, exporting such fuel is duly  registered  with  or  licensed  by  the
  taxing  authorities  of  the  state  to which such fuel is exported as a
  distributor or a dealer in the fuel being so exported, and in connection
  with such exportation such fuel was immediately shipped to an identified
  facility in the state to which such fuel is exported, and the  applicant
  complies  with  all  requirements  and  rules  and  regulations  of  the
  commissioner, including evidentiary requirements, relating thereto;  and
  provided  further that upon receipt of a claim for refund in processible
  form, interest shall be allowed and paid at the overpayment rate set  by
  the  commissioner  pursuant  to  subdivision twenty-sixth of section one
  hundred seventy-one of this chapter from the due date of the  return  to
  the  date  immediately  preceding the date of the refund check except no
  such interest shall be allowed or paid if the  refund  check  is  mailed
  within  thirty  days  of  such  receipt  and except no interest shall be
  allowed or paid if the amount thereof would be less than one dollar. For
  the purpose of this article, "export" from this state shall in no  event
  be  construed  to  include  motor fuel or diesel motor fuel taken out of
  this state in the fuel tank connected with the engine of a motor vehicle
  or any conveyance and consumed in the operation thereof outside of  this
  state.
    9.  With  respect  to  any organization described in paragraph four of
  subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred sixteen of this chapter  which
  is  eligible  pursuant  to  this  section  for  reimbursement of the tax
  required to be paid pursuant to this article, upon receipt  of  a  claim
  for  reimbursement  in  processible  form, interest shall be allowed and
  paid at the overpayment rate set by the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance  pursuant  to  subdivision  twenty-sixth  of section one hundred
  seventy-one of this  chapter  from  the  date  of  the  application  for
  reimbursement  to  the  date  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the
  reimbursement check except no such interest shall be allowed or paid  if
  the reimbursement check is mailed within forty-five days of such receipt
  and  except  no  interest shall be allowed or paid if the amount thereof
  would be less than one dollar. Provided, however, the  department  shall
  process applications for reimbursement as expeditiously as possible.




   §  289-d.   Mailing rules; holidays.  1.  Except as otherwise provided

  application  or  other  document  required  to  be filed, or any payment
  required to be made, within a  prescribed  period  or  on  or  before  a
  prescribed  date  under  authority  of any provision of this article is,
  after such period or such date, delivered by United States mail  to  the
  tax  commission,  bureau,  office,  officer or person with which or with
  whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom  such
  payment  is  required to be made, the date of the United States postmark
  stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to  be  the  date  of  delivery.
  This  subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the
  prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing  of
  such  document,  or  for  making  the  payment,  including any extension
  granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment
  was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly  addressed  to  the
  tax  commission,  bureau,  office,  officer or person with which or with
  whom the document is required to be filed or to which or  to  whom  such
  payment  is  required  to  be  made.   If any document is sent by United
  States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie  evidence
  that  such document was delivered to the tax commission, bureau, office,
  officer or person to which or to whom addressed. To the extent that  the
  tax commission shall prescribe by regulation, certified mail may be used
  in  lieu  of registered mail under this section.  This subdivision shall
  apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States Post Office
  only if and to the extent provided by regulations of the tax commission.
    2.  Any notice authorized or required under this article may be  given
  by  mailing  it  to  the  person  for whom it is intended, in a postpaid
  envelope addressed to such person at the address given  by  him  in  his
  application  for  registration  as  a  distributor or in the last return
  filed by him under this article or, if no application or return has been
  filed, then to such address as may be obtainable.  The mailing  of  such
  notice  shall  be  presumptive  evidence of its receipt by the person to
  whom addressed.  Any period of time, which is  determined  according  to
  the  provisions of this article, for the giving of notice shall commence
  to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
    3.   When the last day prescribed  under  authority  of  this  article
  (including  any  extension  of  time)  for  performing  any act falls on
  Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday  in  the  state  of  New  York,  the
  performance  of  such act shall be considered timely if it is  performed
  on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday  or  a  legal
  holiday.
    4.  (a) Any reference in subdivision one of this section to the United
  States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
  service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
  pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred two of the internal revenue
  code and any reference in subdivision one of this section to a  postmark
  by  the  United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to
  any  date  recorded  or  marked  in  the  manner  described  in  section
  seventy-five  hundred  two  of the internal revenue code by a designated
  delivery service.  If the commissioner finds that any  delivery  service
  designated  by  such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the state,
  the commissioner may withdraw such  designation  for  purposes  of  this
  article.    The  commissioner  may  also  designate  additional delivery
  services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the
  internal revenue code for purposes of this article, or may withdraw  any
  such  designation  if  the commissioner finds that a delivery service so
  designated is inadequate for the needs of the state.   Any reference  in
  subdivision  one  of  this  section  to  the United States mail shall be


 treated as including a reference to any delivery service  designated  by
  the commissioner and any reference in subdivision one of this section to
  a  postmark  by  the  United States mail shall be treated as including a
  reference  to  any  date  recorded  or marked in the manner described in
  section seventy-five hundred two of  the  internal  revenue  code  by  a
  delivery service designated by the commissioner.
    (b)  Any  equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the
  United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by  the
  commissioner  pursuant  to  the same criteria used by such secretary for
  such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred  two  of  the
  internal   revenue  code,  shall  be  included  within  the  meaning  of
  registered or certified mail as used in subdivision one of this section.
  If the commissioner finds that any equivalent of registered or certified
  mail designated by such secretary or the commissioner is inadequate  for
  the  needs  of the state, the commissioner may withdraw such designation
  for purposes of this article.

   §  290-A.  Tax  surcharge.  1.  In  addition  to the tax imposed under
  section two hundred ninety of this article, there is hereby imposed, for
  taxable years ending after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred  ninety  and
  before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven, a tax surcharge at the
  rate  of  fifteen percent in the case of taxable years ending after June
  thirtieth, nineteen hundred  ninety  and  before  July  first,  nineteen
  hundred  ninety-four,  and until such rate is superseded; at the rate of
  ten percent in the case of taxable years ending  after  June  thirtieth,
  nineteen  hundred  ninety-four  and  before July first, nineteen hundred
  ninety-five, and until such rate is superseded;  at  the  rate  of  five
  percent  in  the  case  of  taxable  years  ending after June thirtieth,
  nineteen hundred ninety-five and before  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-six,  and  until such rate is superseded; and at the rate of zero
  percent in the case  of  taxable  years  ending  after  June  thirtieth,
  nineteen  hundred  ninety-six  and  before  July first, nineteen hundred
  ninety-seven, of the tax imposed under section  two  hundred  ninety  of
  this  article. However, the tax surcharge imposed by this section at the
  rate of fifteen percent shall not be imposed upon any taxpayer for  more
  than  forty-eight  months, and the tax surcharge imposed by this section
  at the rates of ten percent, five percent and zero  percent  shall  not,
  respectively,  be imposed upon any taxpayer for more than twelve months,
  and the commissioner shall prescribe by  regulation  or  instructions  a
  method of proration designed to effectuate such result.
    1-a.  Insofar as subdivision one of this section establishes a rate of
  fifteen  percent  in  the  case  of  taxable  years  ending  after  June
  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  ninety  and  before  July first, nineteen
  hundred ninety-four and until such rate is superseded,  a  rate  of  ten
  percent  in  the  case  of  taxable  years  ending after June thirtieth,
  nineteen hundred ninety-four and before  July  first,  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-five and until such rate is superseded, a rate of five percent in
  the  case of taxable years ending after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
  ninety-five and before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-six and until
  such rate is superseded, and a rate of  zero  percent  in  the  case  of
  taxable  years  ending after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-six
  and before July first, nineteen  hundred  ninety-seven,  the  transition
  from such rate of fifteen percent to such rate of ten percent, from such
  rate  of ten percent to such rate of five percent, and from such rate of
  five percent to such rate of zero percent, shall  be  deemed  to  occur,
  respectively,  on  the  first  day  of the seventh month of each of such
  taxable years, with the result that for purposes  of  implementation  of
  such  changes  in rates, and notwithstanding such subdivision one, there
  is hereby imposed with respect to all taxable years  ending  after  June
  thirtieth,  nineteen hundred ninety-four and before July first, nineteen
  hundred ninety-five,  including  taxable  years  of  fewer  than  twelve
  months,  a  tax  surcharge  at  the rate of twelve and one-half percent;
  there is hereby imposed with respect to all taxable years  ending  after
  June  thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-five  and before July first,
  nineteen hundred ninety-six,  including  taxable  years  of  fewer  than
  twelve  months,  a  tax  surcharge  at  the  rate  of seven and one-half
  percent; and there is hereby imposed with respect to all  taxable  years
  ending after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-six and before July
  first,  nineteen  hundred ninety-seven, including taxable years of fewer
  than twelve months, a tax surcharge at the  rate  of  two  and  one-half
  percent.  In  addition,  for  purposes  of  implementation  of  all  the
  provisions of this section references to ten percent shall  be  read  as
  references  to  twelve  and one-half percent, references to five percent
  shall be read as references to seven and one-half percent and references
  to zero percent shall be read as references to two and one-half percent.


   2.  The  provisions  concerning  returns  under  section  two  hundred
  ninety-four  of this article shall be applicable to this section, except
  that for purposes of an automatic extension for six months for filing  a
  return  covering  the  taxes  imposed  by  this  article, such automatic
  extension shall be allowed, for taxable years to which the tax surcharge
  imposed  by  this  section  applies,  only  if a taxpayer files with the
  commissioner  an  application  for  extension  in  such  form   as   the
  commissioner  may  prescribe,  and  pays  on  or before the date of such
  filing, in addition to any other amounts required  under  this  article,
  fifteen  percent  in  the  case  of  taxable  years  ending  after  June
  thirtieth, nineteen hundred  ninety  and  before  July  first,  nineteen
  hundred  ninety-four,  ten  percent  in the case of taxable years ending
  after June thirtieth,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-four  and  before  July
  first, nineteen hundred ninety-five, five percent in the case of taxable
  years  ending  after  June  thirtieth,  nineteen hundred ninety-five and
  before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-six, and zero percent in  the
  case  of  taxable  years  ending  after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
  ninety-six and before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven, of  the
  amount properly estimated as provided in section two hundred ninety-four
  of  this  article as its tax payable under section two hundred ninety of
  this article. The tax surcharge imposed by this section shall be payable
  to the commissioner in full at the time the return  is  required  to  be
  filed.
    3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all of the provisions
  of this article shall apply to the tax surcharge imposed by this section
  with  such  modifications  as may be necessary to adapt such language to
  the tax surcharge imposed by this section. Such provisions  shall  apply
  with the same force and effect as if those provisions had been set forth
  in  full  in  this  section  except  to the extent that any provision is
  either inconsistent with a provision of this section or not relevant  to
  the  tax  surcharge imposed by this section, and to that end a reference
  in this article to the tax surcharge  imposed  by  section  two  hundred
  ninety shall be read as a reference to the tax surcharge imposed by this
  section,  and  to the sum of such tax and such tax surcharge in the case
  of those provisions requiring such reading in order  to  effectuate  the
  purposes  of  this  provision,  unless  a  different  meaning is clearly
  required.






	   §  291.   Meaning of terms.  (a)  Any terms used in this article shall
  have the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in  the  laws
  of  the  United  States  relating  to  federal  income  taxes,  unless a
  different meaning is clearly required.  Any reference in this article to
  the laws of the United States shall mean the provisions of the  internal
  revenue code of nineteen hundred fifty-four, and amendments thereto, and
  other  provisions  of  the laws of the United States relating to federal
  income taxes, as the same may be or become effective at any time or from
  time to time for the taxable year.
    (b)  The term "taxpayer" means an organization or trust  described  in
  section two hundred ninety.
    (c)    The  term "tangible personal property" means corporeal personal

  merchandise,  and  does  not  mean  money,  deposits in banks, shares of
  stock, bonds, notes, credits or evidences of an interest in property and
  evidences of debt.




   §  292.  Unrelated business taxable income. (a) The unrelated business
  taxable income of a taxpayer subject to the tax imposed by  section  two
  hundred  ninety  shall  be  such  taxpayer's  federal unrelated business
  taxable income, as defined in the laws of  the  United  States  for  the
  taxable year, with the following modifications:
    (1)  There shall be added to federal unrelated business taxable income
  the amount of any tax imposed under this article.
    (2) There shall be subtracted from federal unrelated business  taxable
  income  the  amount  of  any  refund  or credit for overpayment of a tax
  imposed under this article or article twenty-three of this chapter.
    (3) The net operating loss deduction which shall be allowed  shall  be
  the same as the net operating loss deduction allowed under paragraph six
  of subsection (b) of section five hundred twelve of the internal revenue
  code of nineteen hundred fifty-four, except that
    (A)  any  net  operating  loss  included in determining such deduction
  shall be adjusted to reflect the addition and subtraction from unrelated
  business taxable income required by  paragraphs  one  and  two  of  this
  subdivision,
    (B)  such deduction shall not include any net operating loss sustained
  during any taxable year  beginning  prior  to  January  first,  nineteen
  hundred  seventy,  or  during any taxable year in which the taxpayer was
  not subject to the tax imposed by this article, and
    (C) such deduction shall not exceed the deduction for the taxable year
  allowable under paragraph six of subsection (b) of section five  hundred
  twelve of the internal revenue code of nineteen hundred fifty-four.
    (4)  There shall be subtracted from federal unrelated business taxable
  income any amount which is included therein  solely  by  reason  of  the
  application of section 501(m)(2)(A) or 512(a)(7) of the internal revenue
  code.
    (5)  Shareholders  of S corporations. (A) In the case of a shareholder
  of an S corporation,
    (i) where the election provided for in subsection (a) of  section  six
  hundred  sixty  of  this  chapter  is  in  effect  with  respect to such
  corporation, there shall be added to federal unrelated business  taxable
  income  an  amount  equal  to  the  shareholder's  pro rata share of the
  corporation's reductions for taxes described in paragraphs two and three
  of subsection (f) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of the  internal
  revenue code, and
    (ii)  where  such  election  has  not  been  made with respect to such
  corporation, there shall be subtracted from federal  unrelated  business
  taxable  income any items of income of the corporation included therein,
  and there shall be added to federal unrelated  business  taxable  income
  any items of loss or deduction included therein, and
    (iii)  in the case of a New York S termination year, the amount of any
  such items of S corporation income, loss, deduction and  reductions  for
  taxes shall be adjusted in the manner provided in paragraph two or three
  of subsection (s) of section six hundred twelve of this chapter.
    (B)  In  the case of a shareholder of a corporation which was, for any
  of its taxable years beginning after nineteen  hundred  ninety-seven,  a
  federal S corporation but a New York C corporation:
    (i)  There shall be added to federal unrelated business taxable income
  S corporation distributions to the extent not included  therein  because
  of the application of section thirteen hundred sixty-eight or subsection
  (e)  of  section  thirteen  hundred  seventy-one of the internal revenue
  code, which represent income not previously subject to  tax  under  this
  article  because  the election provided for in subsection (a) of section
  six  hundred  sixty  of  this  chapter  had  not  been  made.  Any  such
  distribution  treated  in  the  manner  described  in  paragraph  two of


 subsection (b) of such section thirteen  hundred  sixty-eight  shall  be
  treated as ordinary income for purposes of this article.
    (ii)  Where  gain  or  loss  is included in unrelated business taxable
  income  upon  the  disposition  of  stock  or   indebtedness   of   such
  corporation,
    (I)  there  shall  be  added  to unrelated business taxable income the
  amount of increase in basis of such stock or indebtedness  with  respect
  to  such  New York C years of the corporation, pursuant to subparagraphs
  (A) and (B) of paragraph one  of  subsection  (a)  of  section  thirteen
  hundred sixty-seven of such code, and
    (II)  there shall be subtracted from unrelated business taxable income
  the amount of decrease in such basis with respect to  such  New  York  C
  years  of  the  corporation,  pursuant  to  subparagraphs (B) and (C) of
  paragraph two  of  subsection  (a)  of  such  section  thirteen  hundred
  sixty-seven, and
    (III) there shall be subtracted from unrelated business taxable income
  the  amount  of  modifications to unrelated business taxable income with
  respect to such stock pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of this
  paragraph.
    (C) Cross reference. For definitions relating to S  corporations,  see
  subdivision one-A of section two hundred eight of this chapter.
    (6)  Related  members  expense  add back. (A) Definitions. (i) Related
  member.  "Related  member"  means  a  related  person  as   defined   in
  subparagraph  (c)  of  paragraph three of subsection (b) of section four
  hundred sixty-five of the internal  revenue  code,  except  that  "fifty
  percent" shall be substituted for "ten percent".
    (ii)  Effective  rate of tax. "Effective rate of tax" means, as to any
  state or U.S. possession, the maximum statutory rate of tax  imposed  by
  the  state or possession on or measured by a related member's net income
  multiplied by the apportionment percentage, if any,  applicable  to  the
  related member under the laws of said jurisdiction. For purposes of this
  definition, the effective rate of tax as to any state or U.S. possession
  is  zero  where  the  related  member's net income tax liability in said
  jurisdiction is reported on a combined or consolidated return  including
  both the taxpayer and the related member where the reported transactions
  between  the  taxpayer  and the related member are eliminated or offset.
  Also, for purposes of this definition, when computing the effective rate
  of tax for a jurisdiction in which a  related  member's  net  income  is
  eliminated or offset by a credit or similar adjustment that is dependent
  upon  the  related  member  either  maintaining  or  managing intangible
  property or collecting interest income in that jurisdiction, the maximum
  statutory rate of tax imposed by said jurisdiction shall be decreased to
  reflect the statutory rate of tax that applies to the related member  as
  effectively reduced by such credit or similar adjustment.
    (iii)   Royalty  payments.  Royalty  payments  are  payments  directly
  connected to the acquisition, use, maintenance or management, ownership,
  sale, exchange,  or  any  other  disposition  of  licenses,  trademarks,
  copyrights,  trade  names, trade dress, service marks, mask works, trade
  secrets, patents and any other similar types  of  intangible  assets  as
  determined  by  the  commissioner,  and  include  amounts  allowable  as
  interest  deductions  under  section  one  hundred  sixty-three  of  the
  internal  revenue  code  to  the  extent  such  amounts  are directly or
  indirectly for, related to or in connection with the  acquisition,  use,
  maintenance  or  management, ownership, sale, exchange or disposition of
  such intangible assets.
    (iv) Valid business purpose. A valid business purpose is one  or  more
  business  purposes  other  than  the  avoidance or reduction of taxation
  which alone or in combination constitute the primary motivation for some


 business activity or transaction, which activity or transaction  changes
  in  a  meaningful  way, apart from tax effects, the economic position of
  the taxpayer. The economic position of the taxpayer includes an increase
  in  the  market share of the taxpayer, or the entry by the taxpayer into
  new business markets.
    (B) Royalty expense add backs. (i) For the purpose  of  computing  New
  York unrelated business taxable income, a taxpayer must add back royalty
  payments directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred in connection
  with  one  or  more  direct  or  indirect  transactions with one or more
  related members during the taxable year  to  the  extent  deductible  in
  calculating federal unrelated business taxable income;
    (ii)  Exceptions.  (I) The adjustment required in this paragraph shall
  not apply to the portion  of  the  royalty  payment  that  the  taxpayer
  establishes,  by  clear  and  convincing evidence of the type and in the
  form  specified  by  the  commissioner,  meets  all  of  the   following
  requirements: (a) the related member was subject to tax in this state or
  another  state or possession of the United States or a foreign nation or
  some combination thereof on a tax base that included the royalty payment
  paid, accrued or incurred by the taxpayer; (b) the related member during
  the same taxable year directly or indirectly paid, accrued  or  incurred
  such  portion  to  a  person  that  is not a related member; and (c) the
  transaction giving rise to the royalty payment between the taxpayer  and
  the related member was undertaken for a valid business purpose.
    (II)  The adjustment required in this paragraph shall not apply if the
  taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the  type  and
  in  the form specified by the commissioner, that: (a) the related member
  was subject to tax on or measured by its net income  in  this  state  or
  another  state  or  possession  of the United States or some combination
  thereof; (b) the tax base for said  tax  included  the  royalty  payment
  paid,  accrued  or  incurred  by  the  taxpayer;  and  (c) the aggregate
  effective  rate  of  tax  applied  to  the  related  member   in   those
  jurisdictions  is  no  less than eighty percent of the statutory rate of
  tax that applied to the taxpayer under section  two  hundred  ninety  of
  this article for the taxable year.
    (III) The adjustment required in this paragraph shall not apply if the
  taxpayer  establishes,  by clear and convincing evidence of the type and
  in the form specified by the commissioner, that: (a) the royalty payment
  was paid, accrued or incurred to a related member  organized  under  the
  laws of a country other than the United States; (b) the related member's
  income  from  the  transaction was subject to a comprehensive income tax
  treaty between such country and  the  United  States;  (c)  the  related
  member  was  subject  to  tax  in  a  foreign  nation on a tax base that
  included the royalty payment paid, accrued or incurred by the  taxpayer;
  (d)  the  related member's income from the transaction was taxed in such
  country at an effective rate of tax at least equal to  that  imposed  by
  this  state;  and  (e) the royalty payment was paid, accrued or incurred
  pursuant to a transaction that  was  undertaken  for  a  valid  business
  purpose and using terms that reflect an arm's length relationship.
    (IV)  The adjustment required in this paragraph shall not apply if the
  taxpayer and the commissioner agree in writing to the application or use
  of alternative adjustments or computations. The commissioner may, in his
  or her discretion, agree  to  the  application  or  use  of  alternative
  adjustments or computations when he or she concludes that in the absence
  of  such  agreement  the  income  of  the taxpayer would not be properly
  reflected.
    (7) The amount of  any  deduction  allowed  pursuant  to  section  one
  hundred  ninety-nine  of  the  internal  revenue  code  must be added to
  federal unrelated business taxable income.


   (8) There must be added to federal unrelated business  taxable  income
  the  amount  of  any  federal  deduction for taxes imposed under article
  twenty-three of this chapter.
    (b) If the period covered by a return under this article is other than
  the  period  covered  by  the  return  to  the  United  States  treasury
  department, unrelated business taxable income  shall  be  determined  by
  multiplying  the  unrelated  business  taxable  income  reported to such
  department (as modified pursuant to the provisions of this  article)  by
  the  number  of  calendar  months  or major parts thereof covered by the
  return under this article and dividing by the number of calendar  months
  or  major  part  thereof covered by the return to such department. If it
  shall appear that such method of determining unrelated business  taxable
  income does not properly reflect the taxpayer's income during the period
  covered  by  the  return under this article, the tax commission shall be
  authorized, in its discretion, to determine such income  solely  on  the
  basis  of  the taxpayer's income during the period covered by its return
  under this article.




   §  293.    Allocation  of unrelated business taxable income.  (a)  The
  portion of the unrelated business taxable income of  a  taxpayer  to  be
  allocated  within  this  state  shall  be  determined by multiplying its
  unrelated business taxable income by  an  allocation  percentage  to  be
  determined by:
    (1)    ascertaining  the  percentage  which  the  average value of the
  taxpayer's real and tangible personal property in its unrelated trade or
  business within the state during the period covered  by  the  taxpayer's
  return  bears  to  the  average  value  of  all  the taxpayer's real and
  tangible personal property wherever situated during such period which is
  used in its unrelated trade or business (For purposes of this paragraph,
  the taxpayer's real property shall include not only such property  owned
  by the taxpayer but also such property rented to it.);
    (2)   ascertaining the percentage which the receipts of the taxpayer's
  unrelated trade or business, computed  on  the  cash  or  accrual  basis
  according  to  the  method  of accounting used in the computation of the
  taxpayer's unrelated business taxable income, arising during such period
  from
    (A)  sales of tangible personal property by  the  unrelated  trade  or
  business where shipments are made to points within this state,
    (B)    services  performed  within the state by the unrelated trade or
  business,
    (C)  rentals from property of the unrelated trade or business situated
  within the state, and
    (D)  all other receipts earned by  the  unrelated  trade  or  business
  within  the  state,  bear  to  the  total  amount of the receipts of the
  unrelated trade or business, similarly  computed,  arising  during  such
  period  from  all  sales  of  its  tangible personal property, services,
  rentals and all other transactions, whether within or without the state;
    (3)   ascertaining the percentage of the  total  wages,  salaries  and
  other  personal  service  compensation,  similarly computed, during such
  period of employees of the taxpayer's unrelated trade or business within
  the state, except  general  executive  officers,  to  the  total  wages,
  salaries  and  other  personal service compensation, similarly computed,
  during such period of all employees of the unrelated trade  or  business
  within and without the state, except general executive officers; and
    (4)    adding  together the percentages so determined and dividing the
  result by the number of percentages;  provided,  however,  that  if  the
  taxpayer  does not have a regular place of business outside the state in
  which its  unrelated  trade  or  business  is  conducted,  the  business
  allocation percentage shall be one hundred percent.
    (b)    If  it  shall  appear to the tax commission that the allocation
  percentage determined in  subdivision  (a)  of  this  section  does  not
  properly  reflect  the  activity,  business  or  income  of a taxpayer's
  unrelated trade or business within the state, the tax  commission  shall
  be  authorized,  in its discretion, to adjust it by (1) excluding one or
  more of the factors therein, (2) including one or  more  other  factors,
  such as expenses, purchases, contract values (minus subcontract values),
  (3)   excluding   one  or  more  assets  in  computing  such  allocation
  percentage,  provided  the  income  therefrom  is   also   excluded   in
  determining  unrelated  business taxable income or (4) any other similar
  or different method calculated to effect a fair and proper allocation of
  the income reasonably attributable to this state.   The  tax  commission
  from  time  to  time  shall publish all rulings of general interest with
  respect to any application of the provisions of this subdivision.




   §  294. Returns and payment of tax. (a) Every taxpayer and every other
  organization or trust, other  than  an  employee's  trust  described  in
  section  four  hundred  one (a) of the internal revenue code of nineteen
  hundred fifty-four, which is subject to the  federal  tax  on  unrelated
  business  income  having  an  officer,  agent, trustee or representative
  within the state shall, on or before the  fifteenth  day  of  the  fifth
  month  following the close of each of its taxable years, make and file a
  return with the tax commission setting forth such information as the tax
  commission may prescribe.  Every employee's trust described  in  section
  four  hundred one (a) of such code shall make and file a return with the
  tax commission on or before  the  fifteenth  day  of  the  fourth  month
  following  the  close of the trust's taxable year.  Every taxpayer which
  ceases to be subject to the tax imposed by this article shall  make  and
  file  a return with the tax commission on the date of such cessation, or
  at such other time which the tax commission may require,  covering  each
  taxable  year  or  period  for  which  no  return was theretofore filed,
  setting forth such information as the tax commission may require.  Every
  taxpayer shall also file such other returns and furnish such other facts
  and  information as the tax commission may require in the administration
  of this article.
    (b) (1) An automatic extension of six months for  the  filing  of  its
  annual  return  shall  be  allowed  any  taxpayer,  if,  within the time
  prescribed by the preceding paragraph, such taxpayer files with the  tax
  commission  an  application  for  extension,  in  such  form as said tax
  commission may prescribe by regulation, and pays, on or before the  date
  of such filing, the amount properly estimated as its tax, as provided in
  paragraph two of this subdivision.
    (2)  If  a  taxpayer, within the time prescribed by subdivision (a) of
  this section, shall have applied for an automatic extension of  time  to
  file  its  annual  return  and  shall  have  paid to the commissioner of
  taxation and finance on or before the date such application is filed  an
  amount  properly  estimated as hereinafter provided in this subdivision,
  the only amount payable in addition to the tax shall be interest, at the
  underpayment rate set  by  the  commissioner  pursuant  to  section  one
  thousand  ninety-six  of this chapter, or if no rate is set, at the rate
  of six per cent per year, upon the amount  by  which  the  tax,  or  the
  portion thereof payable on or before the date the return was required to
  be  filed (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing
  such  return),  exceeds  the  amount  so  paid.  For  purposes  of  this
  subdivision  an  amount so paid shall be deemed properly estimated if it
  is either  not  less  than  ninety  per  cent  of  the  tax  as  finally
  determined,  or not less than the tax shown on the taxpayer's return for
  the preceding taxable year, if such preceding year was a taxable year of
  twelve months.
    (c) The tax imposed by section two hundred ninety shall be payable  to
  the  tax  commission  in  full  at the time the return is required to be
  filed. Such tax imposed on any taxpayer which ceases to  be  subject  to
  the  tax  imposed by this article shall be payable to the tax commission
  at the time the return is required to be filed and all  other  taxes  of
  any  such  taxpayer,  which  pursuant  to the provisions of this section
  would otherwise be  payable  subsequent  to  the  time  such  return  is
  required to be filed, shall nevertheless be payable at such time.
    (d)  The  tax  commission may grant a reasonable extension of time for
  filing a return or for payment of a tax imposed by  this  article  under
  such conditions as it deems just and proper.

   §  301-a.  Imposition  of  tax. (a) General. Notwithstanding any other
  provision of this chapter, or of any other law, there is hereby  imposed
  upon every petroleum business for the privilege of engaging in business,
  doing  business,  employing  capital,  owning  or  leasing  property, or
  maintaining an office in this state, a monthly tax for each or any  part
  of  a  taxable  month  equal  to  the  sum  of  the motor fuel component
  determined pursuant to subdivision (b)  of  this  section,  the  highway
  diesel  motor  fuel  component  determined  pursuant to paragraph one of
  subdivision (c) of this  section,  the  non-highway  diesel  motor  fuel
  component  determined  pursuant  to  paragraph two of subdivision (c) of
  this section and the residual  petroleum  product  component  determined
  pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section.
    (b)  Motor  fuel  component.  (1)  The  motor  fuel component shall be
  determined by multiplying the motor fuel and highway diesel  motor  fuel
  rate times the number of gallons of (1) motor fuel imported or caused to
  be  imported  into  this  state  by  the  petroleum  business  for  use,
  distribution, storage or sale in the state  or  (2)  produced,  refined,
  manufactured or compounded in the state by the petroleum business during
  the  month  covered by the return under this article. Provided, however,
  that no motor fuel shall be included in the measure of the tax unless it
  shall have previously  come  to  rest  within  the  meaning  of  federal
  decisional  law  interpreting  the United States constitution, nor shall
  any motor fuel be included in the measure of the  tax  imposed  by  this
  article more than once.
    (2)  Motor  fuel  brought  into this state in the fuel tank connecting
  with the engine of a vessel propelled by the  use  of  such  motor  fuel
  shall  be  deemed  to  constitute  a  taxable  use of motor fuel for the
  purposes of this subdivision to the extent that the fuel is consumed  in
  the  operation of the vessel in this state. Provided, however, that this
  paragraph shall not apply to (i)  a  recreational  motor  boat  or  (ii)
  subsequent  to  August  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred  ninety-four, a
  commercial fishing vessel (as defined  in  subdivision  (j)  of  section
  three  hundred  of this article) if the motor fuel imported and consumed
  in this state is used to operate such vessel while it is engaged in  the
  harvesting  of  fish for sale. Provided, further, that tax liability for
  gallonage that a vessel consumes shall be the tax liability with respect
  to the positive difference between the gallonage consumed in this  state
  during  the  reporting  period and the gallonage purchased in this state
  (upon which the tax imposed by this section has been paid)  during  such
  period.  A  credit  or  refund  shall be available for any excess of tax
  liability for gallonage purchased in this state during the  period  over
  tax liability on gallonage so consumed in this state during such period,
  which excess shall be presumed to have been used outside this state.
    (c)  (1)  Highway  Diesel motor fuel component. (A) The highway diesel
  motor fuel component shall be determined by multiplying the  motor  fuel
  and  highway  diesel  motor fuel rate times (1) the number of gallons of
  highway diesel motor fuel sold or used by a petroleum business  in  this
  state  during the month covered by the return under this article and (2)
  with respect to any gallonage which prior thereto has not been  included
  in  the  measure of the tax imposed by this article, times the number of
  gallons of highway diesel motor fuel (i) removed from a terminal,  other
  than  by  pipeline,  barge,  tanker or other vessel, (ii) delivered to a
  filling station or, (iii) delivered into the fuel tank  connecting  with
  the  engine  of  a  motor  vehicle  for  use  in  the operation thereof,
  whichever of the latter three  events  shall  be  the  first  to  occur.
  Provided,  however,  that no highway diesel motor fuel shall be included
  in the measure of the tax unless it shall have previously come  to  rest
  within  the  meaning  of  federal decisional law interpreting the United


 States constitution, nor decisional law, nor shall  any  highway  diesel
  motor fuel be included in the measure of the tax imposed by this article
  more than once.
    (B) Highway diesel motor fuel brought into this state in the fuel tank
  connecting  with  the  engine  of  a vessel propelled by the use of such
  diesel motor fuel shall be deemed to constitute a taxable use of  diesel
  motor  fuel  for the purpose of this paragraph to the extent of the fuel
  that is consumed in the operation of the vessel in this state. Provided,
  however, this paragraph shall not apply to (i) a recreational motor boat
  or (ii) a commercial fishing vessel (as defined in  subdivision  (j)  of
  section  three hundred of this article) if the highway diesel motor fuel
  imported into and consumed  in  this  state  is  used  to  operate  such
  commercial  fishing vessel while it is engaged in the harvesting of fish
  for sale. Provided, further, that tax liability  for  gallonage  that  a
  vessel consumes in this state shall be the tax liability with respect to
  the  positive  difference  between  the gallonage consumed in this state
  during the reporting period and the gallonage purchased  in  this  state
  (upon  which  the tax imposed by this section has been paid) during such
  period. A credit or refund shall be available  for  any  excess  of  tax
  liability  for  gallonage purchased in this state during the period over
  tax liability on gallonage so consumed in this state during such period,
  which excess shall be presumed to have been used outside this state.
    (2) Non-highway diesel motor fuel component.  The  non-highway  diesel
  fuel component shall be determined by multiplying the non-highway diesel
  motor  fuel rate times the number of gallons of non-highway diesel motor
  fuel sold or used by a petroleum business in this state during the month
  covered by the return under this section.  Provided,  however,  that  no
  non-highway  diesel  motor  fuel shall be included in the measure of the
  tax unless it shall have previously come to rest within the  meaning  of
  federal  decisional law interpreting the United States constitution, nor
  shall any non-highway diesel motor fuel be included in  the  measure  of
  the tax imposed by this article more than once.
    (d)  Residual  petroleum  product  component.  The  residual petroleum
  product component  shall  be  determined  by  multiplying  the  residual
  petroleum product rate times the number of gallons of residual petroleum
  product  sold  or  used in this state by a petroleum business during the
  month covered by the return under this article. Provided, however,  that
  no  residual  petroleum  product shall be included in the measure of the
  tax unless it shall have previously come to rest within the  meaning  of
  federal  decisional law interpreting the United States constitution, nor
  shall any residual petroleum product be included in the measure  of  the
  tax imposed by this article more than once.
    (e) Motor fuel and highway diesel motor fuel rate. (1) The basic motor
  fuel  and  highway  diesel  motor  fuel rate shall be ten and two-tenths
  cents per gallon.
    (2) Every year as of January first, the motor fuel and highway  diesel
  motor  fuel  rate  then  in effect on the immediately preceding December
  thirty-first shall be adjusted as follows: such rate shall be multiplied
  by a fraction the numerator of which is the sum of the monthly  producer
  price  index (unadjusted) published by the bureau of labor statistics of
  the United States department of labor for the  category  of  commodities
  designated  "refined  petroleum  products"  for  the  twelve consecutive
  months ending with the month of August of the immediately preceding year
  and the denominator of which is the sum of the  monthly  producer  price
  index  (unadjusted)  published  by the bureau of labor statistics of the
  United States department  of  labor  for  the  category  of  commodities
  designated  "refined  petroleum  products"  for  the  twelve consecutive
  months ending with the month  of  August  in  the  year  prior  to  such


 immediately  preceding  year,  provided, however, that the adjusted rate
  shall not increase above or decrease below the rate  in  effect  on  the
  immediately preceding December thirty-first by more than five percent.
    (3)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this article, the per
  gallon rate with respect to "railroad  diesel"  shall  be  the  adjusted
  motor  fuel  and highway diesel motor fuel rate under paragraphs one and
  two of this subdivision minus one and three tenths cents per gallon.
    (f) Non-highway diesel motor fuel rate.
    (1) The basic non-highway diesel motor fuel rate  shall  be  nine  and
  three-tenths cents per gallon.
    (2)  Every  year as of January first the non-highway diesel motor fuel
  rate then in effect on the immediately preceding  December  thirty-first
  shall  be  adjusted  as  follows:  Such  rate  shall  be multiplied by a
  fraction the numerator of which is the sum of the monthly producer price
  index (unadjusted) published by the bureau of labor  statistics  of  the
  United  States  department  of  labor  for  the  category of commodities
  designated "refined  petroleum  products"  for  the  twelve  consecutive
  months ending with the month of August of the immediately preceding year
  and  the  denominator  of which is the sum of the monthly producer price
  index (unadjusted) published by the bureau of labor  statistics  of  the
  United  States  department  of  labor  for  the  category of commodities
  designated "refined  petroleum  products"  for  the  twelve  consecutive
  months  ending  with  the  month  of  August  in  the year prior to such
  immediately preceding year, provided, however, that  the  adjusted  rate
  shall  not  increase  above  or decrease below the rate in effect on the
  immediately preceding December thirty-first by more than five percent.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this  article,  non-highway
  diesel  motor  fuel  which is "manufacturing gallonage," as such term is
  defined in subdivision (m) of section three  hundred  of  this  article,
  shall  be  exempt  from the measure of the non-highway diesel motor fuel
  component of the tax imposed under this section.
    (g) Residual petroleum product rate. (1) The basic residual  petroleum
  product rate shall be four cents per gallon.
    (2)  Commencing April first, nineteen hundred ninety-one, the residual
  petroleum product rate shall be the product of the basic rate set  forth
  in  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision  multiplied  by a fraction the
  numerator of which is the  sum  of  the  monthly  producer  price  index
  (unadjusted)  published  by the bureau of labor statistics of the United
  States department of labor for the category  of  commodities  designated
  "refined  petroleum  products"  for the twelve consecutive months ending
  with the month of November, nineteen hundred ninety, and the denominator
  of which is the sum of the monthly  producer  price  index  (unadjusted)
  published  by  the  bureau  of the labor statistics of the United States
  department of labor for the category of commodities designated  "refined
  petroleum  products"  for  the twelve consecutive months ending with the
  month of November, nineteen hundred eighty-nine.
    (3)  Commencing  on  the  first  day  of  January,  nineteen   hundred
  ninety-two,  the  residual  petroleum product rate then in effect on the
  immediately  preceding  December  thirty-first  shall  be  adjusted   as
  follows:  Such  rate  shall be multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
  which is the sum  of  the  monthly  producer  price  index  (unadjusted)
  published  by  the  bureau  of  labor  statistics  of  the United States
  department of labor for the category of commodities designated  "refined
  petroleum  products"  for  the twelve consecutive months ending with the
  month of August, nineteen hundred  ninety-one  and  the  denominator  of
  which  is  the  sum  of  the  monthly  producer price index (unadjusted)
  published by the  bureau  of  labor  statistics  of  the  United  States
  department  of labor for the category of commodities designated "refined


 petroleum products" for the twelve consecutive months  ending  with  the
  month of August, nineteen hundred ninety. Commencing on the first day of
  January  of  nineteen  hundred ninety-six and every year thereafter, the
  residual  petroleum  product  rate  then  in  effect  on the immediately
  preceding December thirty-first shall be adjusted as follows: Such  rate
  shall  be  multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the sum of
  the monthly producer price index (unadjusted) published by the bureau of
  labor statistics of the  United  States  department  of  labor  for  the
  category  of commodities designated "refined petroleum products" for the
  twelve consecutive months  ending  with  the  month  of  August  of  the
  immediately  preceding  year  and the denominator of which is the sum of
  the monthly producer price index (unadjusted) published by the bureau of
  labor statistics of the  United  States  department  of  labor  for  the
  category  of commodities designated "refined petroleum products" for the
  twelve consecutive months ending with the month of August  in  the  year
  prior  to  such  immediately preceding year, provided, however, that the
  adjusted  rate  to  take  effect  on  January  first,  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-six and each January first thereafter shall not increase above or
  decrease  below the rate in effect on the immediately preceding December
  thirty-first by more than five percent.
    (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of  this  article,  commencing
  January first, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, residual petroleum product
  which   is  "manufacturing  gallonage,"  as  such  term  is  defined  in
  subdivision (m) of section three  hundred  of  this  article,  shall  be
  exempt  from  the measure of the residual petroleum product component of
  the tax imposed under this section.

    (j) Special  provision  relating  to  lack  of  jurisdiction  to  tax.
  Notwithstanding  any provision of law to the contrary, if a person shall
  receive any motor fuel in this state with respect to  which  this  state
  was  without  power to impose the tax under this article, and such motor
  fuel thereafter becomes subject to the taxing power of this state,  then
  the  person  possessing  such  motor fuel at such time shall be deemed a
  petroleum business and be liable for the tax  under  this  article  with
  respect  to such motor fuel and shall make the same reports and returns,
  pay the same tax and be subject to all other provisions of this  article
  relating to petroleum businesses with respect to motor fuel.
    (l)  Taxes  imposed  on  qualified reservations. In furtherance of the
  joint administration of the taxes imposed by article  twelve-A  of  this
  chapter and the taxes imposed by this article, the provisions of section
  two  hundred eighty-four-e of this chapter concerning the sales of motor

  to  the  payment  and  pass-through of the petroleum business tax in the
  same manner and with the same force and effect as if the  provisions  of
  such  section had been incorporated in full into this article, except to
  the extent that  any  such  provision  is  either  inconsistent  with  a
  provision of this article or not relevant thereto.
    (m)  Special  rate adjustment for certain vessels. Notwithstanding any
  provision of this section to the contrary, the use of non-highway diesel
  motor fuel in the engine of a vessel to  propel  such  vessel  shall  be
  subject  to  tax  at  the  motor fuel and highway diesel motor fuel rate
  provided for in this section, and shall be subject to the provisions  of
  section  three  hundred  one-j of this article, including the adjustment
  set forth in paragraph four of subdivision (a)  of  such  section  three
  hundred  one-j.  A credit or refund shall be available to the extent tax
  paid on gallonage used to propel any such vessel exceeds the  amount  of
  tax  due based on the tax rate set forth herein. Provided, however, that
  the commissioner shall require such documentary proof to qualify for any
  credit or reimbursement provided hereunder  as  the  commissioner  deems
  appropriate.

  petroleum business and  passed  through  to  such  consumer,  (ii)  such
  consumer absorbed the entirety of such tax in the purchase price of such
  gallonage,  and  (iii)  such  gallonage  was  used  and consumed by such
  consumer exclusively as "commercial gallonage". Provided, however,  that
  the commissioner shall require such documentary proof to qualify for any
  reimbursement  of  tax  provided by this subdivision as the commissioner
  deems appropriate, including a certification by the  consumer  that  the
  product  was  used and consumed exclusively as "commercial gallonage" by
  such consumer.
    (2) Calculation. The amount of the reimbursement shall  be  determined
  by  multiplying  the  quantity  of  "commercial  gallonage" eligible for
  reimbursement times the  then  current  rate  of  the  supplemental  tax
  imposed  by  section three hundred one-j of this article with respect to
  non-highway diesel motor fuel or residual petroleum product, as the case
  may be. Any reimbursement of tax may be applied for not more often  than
  monthly.
    (j)  Reimbursement for manufacturing gallonage. A subsequent purchaser
  shall be eligible for reimbursement of  any  taxes  imposed  under  this
  article  with  respect  to  gallonage  of residual petroleum product and
  non-highway diesel motor fuel subsequently sold by such purchaser  to  a
  consumer as "manufacturing gallonage." This reimbursement may be claimed
  only  where  (1)  any tax imposed pursuant to this article has been paid
  with respect to such gallonage and the entire amount  of  such  tax  has
  been  absorbed  by  such  purchaser,  and  (2)  such purchaser possesses
  documentary  proof  satisfactory  to  the  commissioner  evidencing  the
  absorption  by  it  of the entire amount of such tax. Provided, however,


 that the commissioner shall require such documentary  proof  to  qualify
  for  any  reimbursement  of  tax  provided  by  this  subdivision as the
  commissioner deems appropriate including a certificate by  the  consumer
  that   such   product   is  to  be  used  and  consumed  exclusively  as
  "manufacturing gallonage".
    (k) Reimbursement for railroad gallonage. (1) A subsequent  purchaser,
  which  is  registered  as  a  distributor of diesel motor fuel, shall be
  eligible for a reimbursement in accordance with  this  subdivision  with
  respect  to  non-highway  diesel  motor  fuel  subsequently sold by such
  purchaser to a consumer as "railroad diesel".
    (2) The amount of the reimbursement with respect to such product shall
  be equal to the difference between (i) the tax actually paid under  this
  article  by  a  petroleum  business  with  respect  to  such product and
  subsequently passed through to and absorbed by such purchaser, and  (ii)
  the  tax  under  this  article that would have been paid with respect to
  such product had an importing distributor sold such product directly  to
  a  purchaser  as "railroad diesel". Provided that the commissioner shall
  require such documentary proof as the commissioner  deems  necessary  to
  substantiate   a   reimbursement   claim  under  this  subdivision.  Any
  reimbursement of tax may be applied for not more often than monthly.
    (l) Reimbursement for mining and  extraction.  A  purchaser  shall  be
  eligible  for  reimbursement of the tax imposed by section three hundred
  one-a of this article with respect to gallonage  of  residual  petroleum
  product  and  non-highway  diesel  motor  fuel,  purchased  for  use and
  consumption directly and  exclusively  in  the  production  of  tangible
  personal  property  for sale by mining or extracting, but only if all of
  such fuel or product is delivered at the mining or extracting  site  and
  is  consumed  other than on the public highways of this state; provided,
  however, this reimbursement shall  in  no  event  apply  to  a  sale  of
  non-highway  diesel  motor  fuel  which involves a delivery at a filling
  station. This reimbursement may  be  claimed  only  where  (i)  the  tax
  imposed  pursuant  to  this  article  has been paid with respect to such
  non-highway diesel motor fuel or  residual  petroleum  product  and  the
  entire  amount of such tax has been absorbed by such purchaser, and (ii)
  such  purchaser  possesses  documentary  proof   satisfactory   to   the
  commissioner evidencing the absorption by it of the entire amount of the
  tax  imposed  pursuant  to  this  article.  Provided,  however, that the
  commissioner shall require such documentary proof  to  qualify  for  any
  reimbursement  of tax provided by this section as the commissioner deems
  appropriate.
    (m) Reimbursement for passenger commuter ferries. A use by a passenger
  commuter ferry of non-highway diesel motor fuel  or  residual  petroleum
  product  where  such non-highway diesel motor fuel or residual petroleum
  product was used and consumed by a passenger commuter ferry  exclusively
  in  providing  mass  transportation  service.  This reimbursement may be
  claimed only where (1) any tax imposed pursuant to this article has been
  paid with respect to such gallonage and the entire amount  of  such  tax
  has  been  absorbed  by  such  purchaser,  and  (2) such ferry possesses
  documentary  proof  satisfactory  to  the  commissioner  evidencing  the
  absorption  by  it  of the entire amount of such tax. Provided, that the
  commissioner shall require such documentary proof  to  qualify  for  any
  reimbursement provided hereunder as the commissioner deems appropriate.
    * (n)  Reimbursement  for E85. E85 purchased in this state and sold by
  such purchaser in this state where  (1)  such  E85  is  delivered  to  a
  filling station and placed in a storage tank of such filling station for
  such  E85  to  be dispensed directly into a motor vehicle for use in the
  operation of such vehicle, (2) the tax imposed pursuant to this  article
  has been paid with respect to such E85 and the entire amount of such tax


 has  been  absorbed  by such purchaser, and (3) such purchaser possesses
  documentary  proof  satisfactory  to  the  commissioner  evidencing  the
  absorption  by  it  of  the entire amount of the tax imposed pursuant to

  provided hereunder as the commissioner deems appropriate.
    (2)   Calculation   of   partial  reimbursement.  The  amount  of  the
  reimbursement under this subdivision shall be determined by  multiplying
  the  quantity  of  B20  times  twenty  percent  of  the applicable taxes
  otherwise imposed by this article on such fuel.
    * NB Repealed September 1, 2026
    (p) Reimbursement for motor fuel and  diesel  motor  fuel  used  by  a
  voluntary ambulance service, as defined in section three thousand one of
  the  public  health law, a fire company or a fire department, as defined
  in section three of  the  volunteer  firefighters'  benefit  law,  or  a

   §  301-d.  Utility credit or reimbursement. (a) Gallonage eligible for
  credit  or  reimbursement.  An  electric  corporation,  as  defined   in
  subdivision  thirteen  of section two of the public service law, subject
  to the supervision  of  the  department  of  public  service,  shall  be
  entitled  to  a  credit against the tax imposed by section three hundred
  one-a of this article or a reimbursement of such tax with respect to the
  following gallonage:
    (1) Credit. Residual petroleum product and  non-highway  diesel  motor
  fuel  (i) imported into this state by such electric corporation which is
  a petroleum business where the tax liability under section three hundred
  one-a of this article is imposed on such electric corporation and  where
  the residual petroleum or non-highway diesel product so imported is used
  by  such  electric  corporation  to  fuel  generators for the purpose of
  manufacturing or producing electricity or (ii) purchased in  this  state
  by such electric corporation by the use of a valid direct payment permit
  whereby  such  electric  corporation assumed full liability for tax with
  respect to such product where such product so purchased is used by  such
  electric corporation to fuel generators for the purpose of manufacturing
  or producing electricity.
    (2) Reimbursement.  Residual  petroleum product and non-highway diesel
  motor fuel purchased in this state by such  electric  corporation  where
  the  tax  imposed  by  section  three hundred one-a of this article with
  respect to such residual petroleum or diesel product was  paid  and  the
  utility  absorbed  such tax in the purchase price of such fuel and where
  such product is used by such electric corporation to fuel generators for
  the purpose of manufacturing or producing electricity.
    (b) Calculation. The amount of the credit or  reimbursement  shall  be
  determined  by  multiplying  the  gallonage  of  the  residual petroleum
  product eligible for the credit or reimbursement times the basic  credit
  or reimbursement per gallon of two and ninety-eight hundredths cents and
  by  multiplying  the gallonage of all diesel product eligible for credit
  or reimbursement times the basic credit or reimbursement per  gallon  of
  three  cents.  The basic credit or reimbursement per gallon for residual
  petroleum product and diesel product shall be adjusted at the same  time
  and  in  the  same  manner  as  set forth in subdivisions (f) and (g) of
  section three hundred one-a of this  article  for  the  motor  fuel  and
  diesel  motor fuel rate and the residual petroleum product rate. All the
  provisions of subdivision (h)  of  such  section  shall  apply  to  such
  adjusted   credit   or   reimbursement   and  such  adjusted  credit  or
  reimbursement shall be published at the same time and in the same manner
  as such rates are published.  The  credit  or  reimbursement  determined
  pursuant  to  this section shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth
  of a cent. Provided, however, that  on  April  first,  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-nine,  there  shall be added to the basic credit or reimbursement
  amount, with respect to  both  residual  petroleum  product  and  diesel
  product, as then adjusted and in effect, the amount of one-half cent. On
  the  immediately  following  first  day  of  January  and  each  January
  thereafter, there shall be added to the basic  credit  or  reimbursement
  amount,  with  respect  to  both  residual  petroleum product and diesel
  product, as then adjusted and in effect on such  date  (determined  with
  respect  to  the  basic  credit  or  reimbursement  amount only, without
  reference to such one-half cent), the amount of one-half cent.
    (c) Application of the credit or reimbursement. The  credit  shall  be
  applied against liability for tax under this article for the same period
  during  which  the  credit  arose. Any excess may then be applied to tax
  liability under this article for subsequent periods.
    (d) Any reimbursement of tax may be applied for not  more  often  than
  monthly.  An  electric  corporation entitled to reimbursement under this


 section, in lieu of such reimbursement, may take credit  therefor  on  a
  return filed under this article.




   §  301-e.  Aviation  fuel  business.  (a)  Notwithstanding  any  other
  provision of this chapter, for taxable months commencing  on  and  after
  the  first  day  of  September, nineteen hundred ninety, there is hereby
  imposed upon every aviation fuel business for the privilege of  engaging
  in  business,  doing  business,  employing  capital,  owning  or leasing
  property, or maintaining an office in this state, for all or any part of
  each of its taxable months a monthly tax equal to the  sum  of  (1)  the
  aviation  gasoline  component  determined pursuant to subdivision (b) of
  this section and (2)  the  kero-jet  component  determined  pursuant  to
  subdivision (c) of this section. Provided, however, the commissioner may
  permit  the  tax  imposed  under this subdivision and returns related to
  such tax to be paid and filed for a period covering  twelve  consecutive
  taxable months by aviation fuel businesses which are not airlines.
    (b)  Aviation  gasoline component. (1) The aviation gasoline component
  shall be determined by multiplying the aviation gasoline rate times  the
  number of gallons of aviation gasoline imported or caused to be imported
  into  this  state  by  an  aviation fuel business for use, distribution,
  storage or sale in the  state  or  produced,  refined,  manufactured  or
  compounded  in  the  state  by  an aviation fuel business. Provided that
  importation of aviation gasoline into the state in  the  fuel  tanks  of
  aircraft  shall be importation for use for the purposes of this section.
  The basic aviation gasoline rate shall be five and  one-half  cents  per
  gallon.  The rate shall be adjusted at the same time as the rates of the
  components of the  petroleum  business  tax  imposed  by  section  three
  hundred  one-a  of this article, and the method of making adjustments to
  the aviation gasoline rate shall be the same as the method used for such
  rates.
    (2) Partial credit or refund with  respect  to  aviation  gasoline.  A
  distributor  of  motor  fuel  shall  be  entitled to a partial credit or
  refund of the tax paid under this section on aviation gasoline sold to a
  fixed base operator registered under article twelve-a of this chapter as
  a "retail seller of aviation gasoline" under the circumstances described
  in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of subdivision one-a of section two
  hundred eighty-nine-c of  this  chapter.  Provided,  that  in  order  to
  qualify  for  the credit or refund the amount of tax claimed as a credit
  or refund shall  have  been  paid  or  assumed  on  such  sale  by  such
  distributor  and shall have not been passed on to such "retail seller of
  aviation gasoline". A distributor of motor fuel, also  registered  as  a
  "retail  seller  of  aviation  gasoline", shall be entitled to a partial
  credit or refund for aviation gasoline delivered and stored at its fixed
  base operations premises in such subparagraph (i), and  such  credit  or
  refund  shall  accrue at the time the fuel is so delivered and placed in
  such storage facility. An airline which is registered as  a  distributor
  of  motor  fuel  and which imports aviation gasoline into this state for
  use in its airplanes, where delivery and storage take place as described
  in such subparagraph (i), shall also be allowed such partial  credit  or
  refund  of  tax  on  such  fuel  so imported and used exclusively in the
  operation of its airplanes. An aviation fuel business, taxed as such, by
  reason of importation in the fuel tank of  an  airplane  shall  also  be
  allowed  such partial credit or refund for aviation gasoline consumed in
  this state. The amount of the partial credit or refund  allowable  under
  this  subparagraph  shall  be  the  excess of tax which exceeds five and
  two-tenths cents per gallon. Provided, that  such  five  and  two-tenths
  cents  rate  used  to  compute  this  partial credit and refund shall be
  adjusted at the same time as the rate of the aviation gasoline component
  imposed by paragraph one of this subdivision, and the methods of  making
  such  adjustments to this partial credit and refund shall be the same as
  the method used for such rates.


   (c) Kero-jet fuel component. The  kero-jet  fuel  component  shall  be
  determined  by  multiplying  the  kero-jet fuel rate times the number of
  gallons of (1) kero-jet fuel imported or caused to be imported into this
  state by an aviation fuel business and consumed in this  state  by  such
  business  in the operation of its aircraft; and (2) kero-jet fuel, which
  has not been previously included in the measure of the  tax  imposed  by
  this  section,  (i)  which  is  sold  in  this state by an aviation fuel
  business to persons other than those registered under  this  article  as
  aviation  fuel  businesses or (ii) which is consumed in this state by an
  aviation fuel business in the operation of its aircraft.  Provided  that
  importation  of  kero-jet  fuel  in  the fuel tanks of aircraft shall be
  importation for the purposes of this section. The  basic  kero-jet  fuel
  rate  shall  be six and eight-tenths cents per gallon. The rate shall be
  adjusted at the same  time  as  the  rates  of  the  components  of  the
  petroleum  business  tax  imposed by section three hundred one-a of this
  article, and the method of making adjustments to the kero-jet fuel  rate
  shall be the same as the method used for such rates.
    (d)  (1)  An aviation fuel business shall be entitled to reimbursement
  of the tax imposed by this section, less any credit  allowed  or  refund
  granted,  with  respect to aviation gasoline purchased in this state and
  consumed by such business exclusively as aviation fuel in the  operation
  of  its  aircraft  where  such aviation gasoline is not consumed in this
  state, provided that the amount of such tax, less any credit or  refund,
  has  been absorbed by such aviation fuel business. Provided, further, an
  aviation fuel business which has imported aviation  gasoline  into  this
  state  and  consumed  such  aviation  gasoline  in  the operation of its
  aircraft where a portion of such aviation gasoline is  not  consumed  in
  this  state shall be allowed a credit for such gallonage not consumed in
  this state in computing the tax imposed by such section.
    (2) An aviation fuel business shall be entitled  to  reimbursement  of
  the  tax imposed by this section with respect to kero-jet fuel purchased
  in this state and consumed by such business exclusively as aviation fuel
  in the operation of  its  aircraft  where  such  kero-jet  fuel  is  not
  consumed  in this state, provided that the entire amount of such tax has
  been absorbed by such aviation fuel business.
    (3) Any purchaser of aviation gasoline in this state who consumes such
  aviation gasoline exclusively as aviation fuel in the operation  of  its
  aircraft shall be entitled to a partial reimbursement of the tax imposed
  by this section with respect to aviation gasoline which was purchased by
  such  purchaser  and upon which such purchaser paid or absorbed the full
  amount of the tax imposed by this section (where no  partial  credit  or
  refund  under  paragraph  two  of  subdivision  (b)  of this section was
  provided with  respect  to  such  aviation  gasoline)  where:  (i)  such
  purchaser  purchases  the  aviation  gasoline from a fixed base operator
  which qualifies as a retail seller of aviation gasoline but  is  not  so
  registered  under  article  twelve-A  of  this  chapter,  or  (ii)  such
  purchaser purchases the aviation gasoline in bulk from a distributor  of
  motor  fuel registered under article twelve-A of this chapter where such
  distributor delivers such aviation gasoline directly into a bulk storage
  facility of the purchaser which is at a fixed and permanent place at  an
  airport  within  this state and is used solely to fill the fuel tanks of
  its aircraft for use in  the  operations  thereof.  The  amount  of  the
  reimbursement  allowable  under  this  paragraph  shall  be equal to the
  amount of the partial credit or refund allowable under paragraph two  of
  subdivision (b) of this section.
    (4)  The  commissioner shall require such documentary proof to qualify
  for any credit, refund or  reimbursement  of  tax  provided  under  this
  subdivision as the commissioner deems appropriate.


   (e) All the provisions of this article relating to the administration,
  collection  and  disposition of the tax imposed on petroleum businesses,
  including the registration provisions of section three  hundred  two  of
  this  article applicable to residual petroleum product businesses, shall
  apply to the tax imposed by this section and the registration under this
  article  of  aviation  fuel  businesses with such modification as may be
  necessary in order to adapt the language of such provisions to  the  tax
  imposed  by this section. When reference in this article is made to "the
  tax imposed under this article" or where words  of  similar  import  are
  used, unless the context indicates otherwise, such reference shall be to
  the  tax  imposed  under section three hundred one-a of this article and
  this section. The tax imposed by  this  section  shall  be  administered
  jointly  in  conjunction  with,  and  as  a  part of, the tax imposed on
  petroleum businesses as if the provisions of  subdivision  (a)  of  this
  section,  imposing  the  tax under this section, were made a part of the
  imposition provisions of  section  three  hundred  one-a,  except  where
  contrary  or  not  applicable  to or inconsistent with the provisions of
  this section. Provided, further, for the purpose of this section:
    (1)  the  term  "aviation  fuel  business"  shall  mean  a  "petroleum
  business"  as described in paragraph one or paragraph two of subdivision
  (b) of section three hundred of this article except that the  activities
  described  therein  shall  separately  relate to aviation gasoline (such
  paragraph one) and kero-jet fuel (such  paragraph  two)  and  such  term
  shall   also   include  every  corporation  or  unincorporated  business
  importing or causing to be imported aviation fuel into  this  state  for
  consumption by it in this state by bringing such aviation fuel into this
  state  in  aircraft  fuel  tanks which connect to the engines propelling
  such aircraft.
    (2) kero-jet fuel and aviation gasoline consumed in this  state  shall
  be  presumed  to mean all such fuel consumed during takeoffs from points
  in this state;
    (3) where the commissioner of taxation and finance decides  that  with
  respect to a certain petroleum business any of the methods prescribed in
  paragraph  two  of  this subdivision do not fairly and equitably reflect
  fuel consumed in this state, the commissioner shall prescribe methods of
  attribution which fairly and equitably reflect  fuel  consumed  in  this
  state.
    (4)  "aviation  fuel"  means  kero-jet  fuel and aviation gasoline (as
  described in paragraph three of subdivision (a) of section three hundred
  one-b of this article). Provided, further the term  kero-jet  shall  not
  include  naphtha  based  aviation  fuel  refined  and  used  solely  for
  propelling military jet airplanes of the United States Armed Forces.
    (f) An aviation fuel business, which services four or more  cities  in
  the  state  with  non-stop  flights between such cities, shall be exempt
  from the tax imposed by this section and any surcharge imposed  on  such
  tax.




   §  301-h.  Tax  relating to carriers. (a)(1) Notwithstanding any other
  provision of this  chapter,  there  is  hereby  imposed  a  monthly  tax
  measured by the rate of the tax hereunder times the number of gallons of
  motor  fuel  and  diesel motor fuel imported into this state in the fuel
  tanks of qualified motor vehicles which (i) previously thereto, have not
  been included in the measure of the tax imposed by section three hundred
  one-a of this article and  (ii)  are  consumed  in  this  state  in  the
  operation  of  such  qualified motor vehicles. Such number of gallons so
  imported shall be the positive difference between the gallonage consumed
  by the carrier in this state in  its  operations  during  the  reporting
  period  and  the gallonage purchased by the carrier in this state during
  the reporting period, which gallonage has been included in  the  measure
  of  the tax imposed by such section three hundred one-a of this article.
  Each carrier shall be entitled to a credit, equal to the tax under  this
  article absorbed by such carrier with respect to any excess of gallonage
  purchased  in  the  state  during the reporting period over gallonage so
  consumed in this state during such period, against  the  tax  for  which
  such carrier would otherwise be liable for the eight succeeding calendar
  quarters following the end of the reporting period for which such excess
  was  derived,  or,  if a claim for refund is filed on or before the last
  day of the month immediately following the four-year  period  commencing
  with  the end of the reporting period for which such excess was derived,
  the amount of such credit shall be refunded.
    (2) The rate of the tax imposed by this section shall be equal to  the
  motor  fuel and highway diesel motor fuel rate set by subdivision (e) of
  section three hundred one-a  plus  the  rate  of  the  supplemental  tax
  imposed by section three hundred one-j of this article as such rates are
  specified  therein  and  as  they  may  be  adjusted as provided in such
  provisions.
    (3) The tax and tax surcharge shall be upon the  carrier,  as  defined
  for purposes of the tax imposed by article twenty-one-A of this chapter,
  except  that  where the carrier is not the owner of such qualified motor
  vehicle, the tax shall be a joint and several liability  upon  both  the
  carrier  and  the  owner.  The term "qualified motor vehicle" shall mean
  such term as defined for the purposes of the tax imposed by such article
  twenty-one-A.  The  exemptions  provided   by   section   five   hundred
  twenty-five  of such article twenty-one-A shall apply to the tax imposed
  by this section.
    (b) Procedures. Any provision of section three hundred fifteen or  any
  other  provision  of  this  article to the contrary notwithstanding, the
  provisions of sections five  hundred  twenty-six  through  five  hundred
  twenty-eight  of  this  chapter,  including  those provisions of article
  twenty-one-A of this chapter relating to  penalty  and  interest,  shall
  apply  to  the  administration of and procedures with respect to the tax
  imposed by this section in the same manner and with the same  force  and
  effect as if the language of such sections had been incorporated in full
  into  this  section  and  had  expressly  referred to the tax under this
  section, except  to  the  extent  that  any  such  provision  is  either
  inconsistent with a provision of this section or is not relevant to this
  section.
    (c)  Joint  administration.  The commissioner shall jointly administer
  the taxes imposed by article twenty-one-A of this chapter  and  the  tax
  imposed  by  this  section,  including  the joint reporting and payment,
  assessment, collection, determination  and  refund  or  credit  of  such
  taxes.   For   purposes  of  the  joint  administration  of  taxes,  the
  commissioner's  functions  under  such  article  twenty-one-A  and   any
  returns,  forms, statements, documents or information to be submitted to
  the commissioner under such article, any books and records  to  be  kept


 for  purposes  of  the  taxes  imposed by such article, any schedules of
  amounts to be collected under such article, and  the  payment  of  taxes
  under  such  article, shall apply to the tax imposed by this section and
  shall  be  on  a  joint  basis  with respect to such tax imposed by this
  section and the taxes imposed by such article.
    (d) Disposition.  Any  provision  of  this  article  to  the  contrary
  notwithstanding,  the  full  amount  of  tax,  as  well  as interest and
  penalties relating thereto, collected or received  by  the  commissioner
  under  this  section  shall be deposited and disposed of pursuant to the
  provisions  of  section  one  hundred  seventy-one-a  of  this  chapter.
  Beginning  on  April first, two thousand one, all the moneys received by
  the commissioner pursuant to the provisions of  this  section  shall  be
  deposited  in the dedicated fund accounts pursuant to subdivision (d) of
  section three hundred one-j of this article.




   §  301-j.  Supplemental petroleum business tax and supplemental tax on
  aviation  gasoline  component  of  aviation  fuel  business   tax.   (a)
  Imposition  of  tax.    (1) In addition to the taxes imposed by sections
  three hundred one-a and three hundred one-e of this  article,  there  is
  hereby  imposed  upon  every  petroleum  business subject to tax imposed
  under section three hundred one-a of this  article  and  every  aviation
  fuel  business  subject  to  the  aviation gasoline component of the tax
  imposed  under  section  three  hundred  one-e  of   this   article,   a
  supplemental  monthly  tax  for each or any part of a taxable month at a
  rate of six and eight-tenths  cents  per  gallon  with  respect  to  the
  products included in each component of the taxes imposed by such section
  three  hundred  one-a  and  the  aviation  gasoline component of the tax
  imposed by such section three hundred one-e of this article.
    (2) Provided, however, "commercial gallonage," as such term is defined
  in subdivision (k) of section three hundred of this  article,  shall  be
  exempt from the measure of the tax imposed under this section.
    (3)  Provided,  further, "railroad diesel," as such term is defined in
  subdivision (l) of section three  hundred  of  this  article,  shall  be
  exempt from the measure of the tax imposed under this section.
    (4)  Provided,  further,  a  separate per gallon rate shall apply with
  respect to highway diesel motor fuel. Such rate shall be  determined  by
  taking  the  adjusted rate per gallon of tax imposed under paragraph one
  of this subdivision as adjusted in accordance  with  paragraph  five  of
  this subdivision and subtracting therefrom one and three-quarters cents.
  Commencing   January  first,  two  thousand  twelve,  and  each  January
  thereafter, the per gallon rate applicable to highway diesel motor  fuel
  shall  be  the  adjusted rate under paragraph one of this subdivision as
  adjusted in accordance with paragraph five  of  this  subdivision  which
  commences on such date minus one and three-quarters cents. The resulting
  rate under this paragraph shall be expressed in hundredths of a cent.
    (5)  Except  as  herein  provided,  the tax imposed under this section
  shall be calculated in the same respective manner as the  taxes  imposed
  by  section  three hundred one-a and section three hundred one-e of this
  article. Except for section three hundred one-d and except as  otherwise
  provided  in this section, all the provisions of this article applicable
  to the taxes imposed by sections three hundred one-a and  three  hundred
  one-e  of this article, shall apply with respect to the supplemental tax
  imposed by this section to the same extent as if  it  were  respectively
  imposed by such sections.
    (b) Credit, refund or reimbursement with respect to aviation gasoline.
  (i)  A  credit  or refund of the tax paid under this section relative to
  the tax imposed on aviation gasoline under section three  hundred  one-e
  of  this  article  shall  be available with respect to aviation gasoline
  which qualifies for the partial credit or refund under paragraph two  of
  subdivision (b) of section three hundred one-e of this article.
    (ii)  A  reimbursement  of the tax paid under this section relative to
  the tax imposed on aviation gasoline under section three  hundred  one-e
  of  this  article  shall  be available with respect to aviation gasoline
  which qualifies for the partial reimbursement under paragraph  three  of
  subdivision  (d)  of section three hundred one-e of this article and for
  which no credit or refund under subparagraph (i) of this  paragraph  was
  provided.
    (iii) The commissioner shall require such documentary proof to qualify
  for  any  credit,  refund  or  reimbursement  of  tax  provided  by this
  paragraph as the commissioner deems appropriate.
    (c) Rate adjustment.  The  rate  of  the  supplemental  tax  shall  be
  adjusted  at  the  same time as the rates of the components of the taxes
  imposed by sections three hundred one-a and three hundred one-e of  this


 article,  and  the  method  of  making  adjustments  to  the rate of the
  supplemental tax shall be the same as the method used for such rates.
    (d)  Deposit  and  disposition of revenue. All taxes, and any interest
  and penalties relating thereto, collected or received  with  respect  to
  the  supplemental  petroleum  and  aviation fuel business tax imposed by
  this section up to and including March  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-three  shall  be  deposited  and  disposed  of  pursuant  to  the
  provisions of section one hundred seventy-one-a of this chapter.  Except
  as  otherwise  provided,  on  and  after  April  first, nineteen hundred
  ninety-three,  all  taxes,  and  any  interest  and  penalties  relating
  thereto,  collected  or  received  in  any  month  with  respect to such
  supplemental petroleum and aviation fuel business tax  imposed  by  this
  section,  together with any other moneys specified in this chapter to be
  deposited under this subdivision, shall be deposited, on or  before  the
  fifteenth  day  of  each  succeeding  month,  proportionately  into  the
  following dedicated fund accounts without priority; sixty-three  percent
  in  the  dedicated highway and bridge trust fund established pursuant to
  section eighty-nine-b of the state finance law, thirty-four  percent  in
  the  dedicated  mass  transportation  trust fund established pursuant to
  section eighty-nine-c of the state finance  law  to  be  distributed  as
  follows:  eighty-five  percent  of such amount shall be allocated to the
  New York city transit authority and  its  subsidiaries  and  the  Staten
  Island  rapid  transit  operating  authority and fifteen percent of such
  amount shall be allocated to the Long Island Rail Road Company and metro
  north commuter railroad company in accordance with  the  procedures  for
  payment  and  distribution specified in section one thousand two hundred
  seventy-c of  the  public  authorities  law,  for  payment,  subject  to
  appropriation,  to  the  metropolitan transportation authority dedicated
  tax fund established pursuant to section twelve hundred seventy-c of the
  public authorities  law,  and  three  percent  in  such  dedicated  mass
  transportation  trust  fund to be distributed, subject to appropriation,
  for purposes authorized by section eighty-nine-c of  the  state  finance
  law,  to  entities  other than the mass transit operating agencies which
  receive money from the metropolitan transportation  authority  dedicated
  tax  fund.  Notwithstanding  any general or special law to the contrary,
  other than a law which makes specific reference to this sentence of this
  section, so long as such metropolitan transportation authority dedicated
  tax  fund  shall  exist,  any  appropriation  from  the  dedicated  mass
  transportation  trust fund to the metropolitan transportation authority,
  its  affiliates  or  its  subsidiaries  shall  be  deemed   to   be   an
  appropriation to the metropolitan transportation authority and the total
  amount  paid pursuant to such appropriation or appropriations or section
  thirty-one  of  chapter  fifty-six  of  the  laws  of  nineteen  hundred
  ninety-three  including  the  second  clause  of  the  first sentence of
  subdivisions a and b thereof, shall be deposited  to  such  metropolitan
  transportation   authority   dedicated   tax  fund  and  distributed  in
  accordance with the provisions of section twelve  hundred  seventy-c  of
  the public authorities law.
    Prior  to  making  deposits  as  provided  in  this  subdivision,  the
  comptroller shall retain such amount as the commissioner  may  determine
  to  be necessary, subject to the approval of the director of the budget,
  for reasonable costs of the department in administering  and  collecting
  the  taxes  deposited  pursuant  to this subdivision and for refunds and
  reimbursements with respect to such taxes, out of which the  comptroller
  shall pay any refunds or reimbursements of such taxes to which taxpayers
  shall  be  entitled.  Provided,  further,  however,  that, prior to such
  deposit, from the amounts so collected or  received  during  the  period
  commencing  on January first, nineteen hundred ninety-four and ending on


 March thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-four, an amount equal to the
  portion of the taxes, interest and penalties so  received  or  collected
  resulting  from  the  amendments made by sections forty-two, forty-three
  and  forty-four  of  chapter fifty-seven of the laws of nineteen hundred
  ninety-three  shall  be  deposited  and  disposed  of  pursuant  to  the
  provisions  of  subdivision  one of section one hundred seventy-one-a of
  this chapter.




   §  301-l.  Refund  for  tax with respect to in-bulk consumer bad debt.
  There shall be allowed to a registered petroleum  business  or  aviation
  fuel  business  a  refund  under  this  section for the taxes imposed by
  sections three hundred one-a, three hundred  one-e,  and  three  hundred
  one-j  of this article for the tax paid under such sections with respect
  to gallonage which is represented by a worthless debt as follows:
    (a) The refund shall be allowed to a registered petroleum business  or
  aviation fuel business for gallonage with respect to which tax liability
  for  the  taxes under this article is imposed on such petroleum business
  or aviation fuel business where (i) such gallonage has been included  in
  the  reports  filed by such petroleum business or aviation fuel business
  and all the taxes under this article with respect to such gallonage have
  been paid by such business, (ii) such gallonage was sold in-bulk by such
  petroleum or aviation fuel business to a purchaser for such  purchaser's
  own  use  and  consumption and (iii) such sale gave rise to a debt which
  became worthless, as that term is used for federal income tax  purposes,
  and  where  such debt is deducted as a worthless debt for federal income
  tax purposes for the taxable year  covering  the  month  in  which  such
  refund  claim relating to such debt is filed. Provided, however, for the
  purposes of this section, a sale of motor fuel and highway diesel  motor
  fuel  to a filling station shall be deemed to be a sale in-bulk for such
  filling station's own use and consumption and, provided, further, in  no
  event  shall  a  worthless  debt  qualify  with  respect  to  the refund
  hereunder where such debt arises from a retail sale at a filling station
  or sale wherein product is delivered directly into the fuel  tank  of  a
  motor vehicle, airplane or other conveyance.
    (b) Partial payment. Where a debt became worthless only in part due to
  partial  payment,  the  amount of the refund under this section shall be
  determined by apportioning the amount of any partial payment  among  the
  components  of  the  total  purchase  price,  including  tax  under this
  article, and the amount of tax remaining unpaid after application of the
  partial payment shall be the amount of the refund.
    (c) Upon receipt of a claim for refund in processible  form,  interest
  shall   be  allowed  and  paid  at  the  overpayment  rate  set  by  the
  commissioner pursuant to subdivision twenty-sixth of section one hundred
  seventy-one of this chapter from the date of the receipt of  the  refund
  claim  to  the  date  immediately preceding the date of the refund check
  except no such interest shall be allowed or paid if the refund check  is
  mailed  within  ninety days of such receipt and except no interest shall
  be allowed or paid if the amount thereof would be less than one  dollar.
  Provided, further, the refund shall be granted pro rata against sections
  three  hundred  one-a,  three  hundred one-e, and three hundred one-j of
  this article, as the case may be, to the same extent as  represented  by
  the  remittance of the petroleum business or aviation fuel business with
  respect to the gallonage represented by the worthless debt.
    (d) In addition to the applicable report and evidence of tax  payment,
  the  commissioner  may  require  such  other  evidentiary  proof  as the
  commissioner deems appropriate  to  demonstrate  qualification  for  the
  refund  under  this  section.  Provided, further, that the refund of tax
  allowed under this section, for purposes of  the  income  and  franchise
  taxes  imposed  by this chapter, shall be reported in such detail as the
  commissioner may direct. Moreover, notwithstanding any provision to  the
  contrary,  all  state  agencies shall cooperate with the commissioner in
  administering the refund authorized by this section and shall share with
  such  commissioner  such  information  as  the  commissioner  may   deem
  appropriate in administering the refund under this section.
    (e)  If  there is a disallowance of a bad debt with respect to which a
  refund under this section has been paid, such  disallowance  shall  have


 the  effect  of and be treated as a report of federal change, correction
  or disallowance (as such effect and treatment is  described  in  section
  six  hundred  fifty-nine  and  subdivision  three of section two hundred
  eleven  of  this chapter) and the time to assess under this article with
  respect to such disallowance shall be determined as set  forth  in  such
  sections.






	   § 301-m. Credit or reimbursement for certain governmental purchases by
  credit  card.  Notwithstanding any provision of the law to the contrary,
  tax paid pursuant to this article in respect to  motor  fuel  or  diesel
  motor  fuel  purchased  by  a  government  entity  and  paid for by such
  government entity with a credit card shall be reimbursed or credited  to
  the  issuer  of  the  credit  card  used  for  such purchase or the fuel
  distributor designated in accordance with and subject to the  provisions
  of  sections  eleven  hundred  thirty-eight, eleven hundred thirty-nine,
  eleven hundred forty-two, and eleven hundred forty-five of this  chapter
  concerning  such  credit  card issuers, fuel distributors and government
  entities. Such provisions shall apply with respect to the administration
  of and procedure with respect to the taxes imposed under this article in
  the same manner and with the same force and effect as if the language of
  such provisions had been incorporated in full into this article and  had
  expressly   referred   to   the   tax  under  this  article,  with  such
  modifications as may be necessary in order to adapt the language of such
  provisions to the taxes imposed by this article, except  to  the  extent
  that any such provision is not relevant to this article.






   §   302.   Registration  of  petroleum  businesses.  (a)  Registration
  required.  Each petroleum business with respect to motor  fuel  must  be
  registered  with the department of taxation and finance as a distributor
  of motor fuel under article twelve-A of  this  chapter.  Each  petroleum
  business  with  respect to diesel motor fuel must be registered with the
  department of taxation and finance as a distributor of diesel motor fuel
  under article twelve-A of  this  chapter  or,  where  applicable,  as  a
  "distributor  of  kero-jet fuel only" under such article. Each petroleum
  business with respect to residual petroleum product must  be  registered
  as  a  residual petroleum product business under subdivision (b) of this
  section. No petroleum business unless  so  registered,  shall  make  any
  sale,  transfer,  use  or  other disposition of motor fuel, diesel motor
  fuel or residual petroleum product within  the  state,  except  a  sale,
  transfer, use or other disposition, if any, as to which the state cannot
  impose such condition by reason of the United States constitution and of
  laws  of  the  United States enacted pursuant thereto. No person, unless
  registered as a residual petroleum product business under this  section,
  shall (i) import or cause residual petroleum product to be imported into
  this  state,  (ii)  produce,  refine,  manufacture  or compound residual
  petroleum product within the state, or (iii)  make  a  sale  or  use  of
  residual  petroleum  product  in  the  state  other  than  a self-use of
  residual petroleum product which has been the subject of a  retail  sale
  to such person.
    (b)  Residual  petroleum  product  business.  The department, upon the
  application of a corporation or unincorporated business, shall  register
  such  corporation  or  unincorporated  business  as a residual petroleum
  product business except that the commissioner may refuse to register  an
  applicant for any of the grounds specified in subdivision two or five of
  section  two  hundred eighty-three of this chapter or in subdivision (d)
  of this section. The application shall be in such form and contain  such
  information  as  the commissioner shall prescribe. All of the provisions
  of subdivisions two, four, five, six, seven,  eight,  nine  and  ten  of
  section   two   hundred   eighty-three   of  this  chapter  relating  to
  registration of distributors shall be applicable to the registration  of
  residual  petroleum  product businesses under this section with the same
  force and effect as if the  language  of  those  subdivisions  had  been
  incorporated  in  full in this section and had expressly referred to the
  registration of  residual  petroleum  product  businesses  and  the  tax
  imposed  by  this article, with such modification as may be necessary in
  order to adapt the language of such provisions to the provisions of this
  article, provided, specifically, that the term  "distributor"  shall  be
  read  as "residual petroleum product business" and the term "motor fuel"
  shall be read as "residual petroleum product". Provided,  however,  that
  if   the  commissioner  is  satisfied  that  the  requirements  of  such
  provisions for registration are not necessary in order  to  protect  tax
  revenues,  the  commissioner  may limit or modify such requirements with
  respect to corporations or unincorporated businesses not required to  be
  registered as distributors of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel.
    (c)  Bond  or other security. The commissioner may require a petroleum
  business to file with it a bond issued by a surety company  approved  by
  the   superintendent   of   financial   services   as  to  solvency  and
  responsibility and authorized to transact  business  in  this  state  or
  other  security  acceptable  to  the commissioner, in such amount as the
  commissioner may fix in an amount determined in  accordance  with  rules
  and regulations prescribed by the commissioner, to secure the payment of
  any  sums due from such petroleum business pursuant to this article. The
  commissioner may require that such a bond or  other  security  be  filed
  before a petroleum business is registered, and the amount thereof may be


 increased  at  any  time when in the commissioner's judgment the same is
  necessary as a  protection  to  the  revenues  under  this  article.  If
  securities  are  deposited  as  security  under  this  subdivision, such
  securities shall be kept in the joint custody of the comptroller and the
  commissioner of taxation and finance. Such securities may be sold by the
  commissioner  if  it  becomes necessary so to do in order to recover any
  sums due from such petroleum business pursuant to this article,  but  no
  such  sale  shall  be had until after such petroleum business shall have
  had opportunity to litigate the validity of any tax if it elects  so  to
  do.  Upon  any  such  sale the surplus, if any, above the sums due under
  this article shall be returned to such petroleum business.  All  of  the
  provisions  of  paragraph  (b) of subdivision six of section two hundred
  eighty-three of this chapter relating to increasing the  amount  of  the
  bond or other security required to be filed pursuant to article twelve-A
  of  this chapter shall be applicable to bonds or other security required
  to be filed pursuant to this subdivision.
    (d) Refusal to register. For the purposes of  determining  whether  to
  refuse  an  application  for registration under article twelve-A of this
  chapter as a distributor of motor fuel, diesel motor  fuel  or  kero-jet
  fuel  only  or  under  this  section  as  a  residual  petroleum product
  business, the references in  subdivision  two  of  section  two  hundred
  eighty-three  of  this chapter to employees or shareholders under a duty
  to file a return under or pursuant to the authority of article  twelve-A
  of this chapter or pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant to the authority
  of  such  article  on behalf of the applicant or another person shall be
  deemed to also include an employee under a duty to file a return or  pay
  taxes  under  or  pursuant to the authority of this article on behalf of
  such applicant or other person. In addition to the grounds specified  in
  section  two  hundred eighty-three of this chapter, the commissioner may
  refuse to register an applicant as a distributor of motor  fuel,  diesel
  motor  fuel  or  kero-jet  fuel  only or as a residual petroleum product
  business where  the  commissioner  ascertains  that  the  applicant,  an
  officer, director or partner of the applicant, a shareholder directly or
  indirectly owning more than ten percent of the number of shares of stock
  of  such applicant (where such applicant is a corporation) entitling the
  holder thereof to vote for the election of directors or trustees, or  an
  employee  or shareholder of such applicant under a duty to file a return
  under or pursuant to the authority of this article or  article  twelve-A
  of  this  chapter  or  to  pay  the  taxes imposed by or pursuant to the
  authority of this article or article twelve-A of this chapter on  behalf
  of  the  applicant, (1) has committed any of the acts or omissions which
  are, or was convicted as, specified in subdivision (e) of  this  section
  within  the  preceding  five  years,  or (2) was an officer, director or
  partner of another person, or who directly or indirectly owned more than
  ten percent of the shares of stock of another person (where  such  other
  person  is  a  corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for the
  election of directors or trustees, or who was an employee or shareholder
  of another person under a duty to file a return under or pursuant to the
  authority of this article or article twelve-A of this chapter or pay the
  taxes imposed by or pursuant to the authority of this article or article
  twelve-A of this chapter on behalf of such other person at the time such
  other person committed any of the acts or omissions which  are,  or  was
  convicted  as,  specified  in subdivision (e) of this section within the
  preceding five years.
    (e) Cancellation or suspension of  registration.  The  grounds  for  a
  cancellation  or  suspension of a registration under article twelve-A of
  this chapter as a distributor  of  motor  fuel,  diesel  motor  fuel  or
  kero-jet fuel only or under this section as a residual petroleum product


 business are those grounds specified in section two hundred eighty-three
  of  this chapter and, in addition to such grounds, the following grounds
  relating to this article shall apply:
    (1)  A  registration as a distributor of motor fuel, diesel motor fuel
  or kero-jet fuel only or as a residual petroleum product business may be
  cancelled or suspended if the commissioner determines that a  registrant
  or  an  officer,  director  or  partner of the registrant, a shareholder
  directly or indirectly owning more than ten percent  of  the  number  of
  shares  of  stock  of  such  registrant  (where  such  registrant  is  a
  corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for  the  election  of
  directors  or trustees, or an employee or shareholder of such registrant
  under a duty to file a return under or pursuant to the authority of this
  article or article twelve-A of this chapter or to pay the taxes  imposed
  by  or  pursuant to the authority of this article or article twelve-A of
  this chapter on behalf of the registrant (A) fails to file  or  maintain
  in full force and effect a bond or other security when required pursuant
  to  subdivision  (c)  of  this  section  or  when  the amount thereof is

  business or has committed fraud  or  deceit  in  procuring  his  or  its
  registration,
    (G) has impersonated any person represented to be a petroleum business
  under  this article but not in fact registered as a distributor of motor
  fuel, diesel motor fuel or kero-jet fuel only or  a  residual  petroleum
  product business, or
    (H)  has  knowingly  aided and abetted the distribution of motor fuel,
  diesel motor fuel  or  residual  petroleum  product  by  corporation  or
  unincorporated business which such registrant or such other person knows
  (i)  has  not  been  registered  by the commissioner as a distributor of
  motor fuel, diesel motor fuel or kero-jet fuel only  or  as  a  residual
  petroleum  product business and (ii) is a petroleum business pursuant to
  the terms of subdivision (b) of section three hundred of this article.
    (2) A registration as a distributor of motor fuel, diesel  motor  fuel
  or kero-jet fuel only or as a residual petroleum product business may be
  cancelled  or suspended if the commissioner determines that a registrant
  or an officer, director or partner  of  the  registrant,  a  shareholder
  directly  or  indirectly  owning  more than ten percent of the number of
  shares  of  stock  of  such  registrant  (where  such  registrant  is  a
  corporation)  entitling  the  holder thereof to vote for the election of
  directors or trustees, or an employee or shareholder of such  registrant

  was  an  officer,  director  or  partner  of  another  person  or  was a
  shareholder directly or indirectly owning more than ten percent  of  the
  number  of shares of stock of another person (where such other person is
  a corporation) entitling the holder thereof to vote for the election  of
  directors  or  trustees,  or  was  an employee or shareholder of another
  person under a duty to file a return under or pursuant to the  authority


 of  this article or article twelve-A of this chapter or to pay the taxes

  twelve-A of this chapter on behalf of such other person at the time such
  other  person  committed  any  of the acts specified in paragraph one of
  this subdivision within the preceding five years.
    (f) Cancellation or suspension of registration prior to a hearing. The
  grounds for  cancelling  or  suspending  a  registration  under  article
  twelve-A  of  this  chapter as a distributor of motor fuel, diesel motor
  fuel or kero-jet fuel only or under this section as a residual petroleum
  product business prior to a hearing are those specified  in  subdivision
  five  of  section  two  hundred  eighty-three  of  this  chapter and, in
  addition to such grounds, the following grounds relating to this article
  shall apply:
    (1) the failure  to  file  a  return  within  ten  days  of  the  date
  prescribed  for  filing a return under this article or nonpayment of any
  tax due pursuant to this article if the registrant shall have failed  to
  file  such  return  or pay such taxes within ten days after the date the
  demand therefor is sent by registered or certified mail to  the  address

  subdivision five of section two hundred eighty-three of this chapter,
    (2)  the  failure  to continue to maintain in full force and effect at
  all times the bond or other security required to be  filed  pursuant  to
  subdivision  (c)  of  this  section, provided, however, that if a surety
  bond is cancelled  prior  to  expiration,  the  commissioner  may  after
  considering all the relevant circumstances make such other arrangements,
  and  may  require  the filing of such other bond or other security as it
  deems appropriate,
    (3) the transfer of a registration as a  residual  petroleum  business
  without the prior written approval of the commissioner, or
    (4)  with  respect to a petroleum business which is a corporation, the
  dissolution or annulment of such corporation pursuant to  section  three
  hundred ten of this article.




   §  305.    Exempt entities.--No corporation or unincorporated business
  shall be a petroleum business subject to tax under this article  because
  it  imported  or  caused  motor  fuel,  diesel  motor  fuel  or residual
  petroleum product to be imported into this state or  produced,  refined,
  manufactured  or compounded such products in this state where such motor
  fuel, diesel motor fuel or residual petroleum product is exclusively for
  the use and consumption of such corporation or  unincorporated  business
  and  such  corporation  or  incorporated  business  is  an  organization
  described in subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred sixteen  of  this
  chapter.




   §  308.  Returns  and  payment  of tax.--(a) General.--Every petroleum
  business subject to tax under this article shall monthly, on  or  before
  the  twentieth  day  following  the  close  of its taxable month, file a
  return which shall state  (i)  the  number  of  gallons  of  motor  fuel
  imported or caused to be imported into this state for use, distribution,
  storage  or  sale  in  the  state  or produced, refined, manufactured or
  compounded in the state during the preceding calendar  month,  (ii)  the
  number  of gallons of diesel motor fuel sold or used or, with respect to
  gallonage which prior thereto has not been included in  the  measure  of
  the  tax imposed by this article, delivered by the petroleum business to
  a filling station or into the fuel tank connecting with the engine of  a
  motor  vehicle  for  use  in  the operation thereof during the preceding
  calendar month, (iii) the  number  of  gallons  of,  and  the  resultant
  product  produced, manufactured or blended, using diesel motor fuel as a
  component of such resultant product and  the  sales  of  such  resultant
  product,  and  (iv)  the number of gallons of residual petroleum product
  sold or used in this state and the  sales  of  such  residual  petroleum
  product,  for  the  period  covered by such return. A residual petroleum
  business shall include in its reports the number of gallons of  residual
  petroleum  product  imported  into the state or purchased in this state,
  the number of gallons of diesel motor fuel purchased in this  state  and
  the   number   of  gallons  of,  and  the  resultant  product  produced,
  manufactured or blended by such petroleum business, using  diesel  motor
  fuel  as  a  component  of  such  resultant product. The commissioner of
  taxation and finance may permit the filing of a return  on  a  quarterly
  basis  in  the  case  of  a petroleum business which only makes sales of
  diesel motor fuel solely for residential heating purposes and  which  is
  registered under article twelve-A of this chapter as a diesel motor fuel
  distributor   under  a  limited  registration  applicable  only  to  the
  importation, sale and distribution of diesel motor fuel for the purposes
  described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of subdivision  three  of
  section  two  hundred  eighty-two-a  of this chapter or in the case of a
  petroleum business registered as a "distributor of kero-jet  fuel  only"
  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of subdivision two of section two hundred
  eighty-two-a of this chapter. In the case of such returns  permitted  to
  be  filed on a quarterly basis, the adjustments to the rates of tax then
  in effect, as provided for in sections three  hundred  one-a  and  three
  hundred  one-e  of  this  article, which take effect on the first day of
  January of each year shall, with respect to such quarterly return,  take
  effect  on  the first day of the next succeeding March. Returns shall be
  filed with the commissioner in a form prescribed  by  the  commissioner,
  setting  forth such other information as the commissioner may prescribe.
  Every petroleum business shall also transmit such other returns and such
  facts  and  information  as  the  commissioner  may   require   in   the
  administration  of  this  article.  Every  petroleum business which is a
  corporation subject to tax  under  this  article  and  which  ceases  to
  exercise  its  franchise  or  to  be  subject to the tax imposed by this
  article shall transmit to the commissioner a return on the date of  such
  cessation,  or  at  such  other  time  as  the commissioner may require,
  covering each month or period for which no return was theretofore filed.
  The commissioner may, if the commissioner deems it necessary in order to
  insure the payment of the tax imposed by this article,  require  returns
  to  be  made at such times and covering such periods as the commissioner
  may deem necessary. Notwithstanding the  foregoing  provisions  of  this
  subdivision,   the   commissioner   may   require   any  corporation  or
  unincorporated  business  which  engages   in   transactions   involving
  petroleum  or  similar  products,  including  aviation  fuels, to file a
  monthly  return,  which  shall  contain  any  data  specified  by   him,


 regardless  of  whether  such  corporation or unincorporated business is
  subject to tax under this article.
    (b)  Payment  of  tax.  Each  petroleum  business  shall  pay  to  the
  commissioner of taxation and finance with the filing of  the  return  or
  returns the tax imposed by this article during the period covered by the
  return.   Such  tax  imposed  on  any  petroleum  business  which  is  a
  corporation and which ceases to exercise its franchise or to be  subject
  to  the tax imposed by this article shall be payable to the commissioner
  at the time the return is required to be filed, provided such tax  of  a
  petroleum  business  which is a domestic corporation and which continues
  to  possess  its  franchise  shall  be  subject  to  adjustment  as  the
  circumstances  may  require;  all  other  taxes  of  any  such petroleum
  business, which pursuant to the foregoing  provisions  of  this  section
  would  otherwise  be  payable  subsequent  to  the  time  such return is
  required to be filed, shall nevertheless be payable at such time.
    (c) Special provisions regarding sole  proprietorships.--With  respect
  to any petroleum business which is a sole proprietorship:
    (1)  the  return  for such petroleum business where the proprietor has
  died shall be made and filed by his executor,  administrator,  or  other
  person charged with his property, and
    (2)  the  return  for  such petroleum business where the proprietor is
  unable to make a return by reason of a  disability  shall  be  made  and
  filed  by  his conservator, committee, fiduciary or other person charged
  with the care of his person  or  property  (other  than  a  receiver  in
  possession  of  only  a part of his property), or by his duly authorized
  agent.
    (d) Estates and trusts.--The return for a petroleum business which  is
  an estate or trust shall be made and filed by the fiduciary.
    (e)  Joint fiduciaries.--If two or more fiduciaries are acting jointly
  on behalf of a petroleum business, the return may be made by any one  of
  them.
    (f) Notice of qualification as receiver, etc.--Every receiver, trustee
  in  bankruptcy, assignee for benefit of creditors of, or other fiduciary
  for a petroleum business shall give notice of his qualification as  such
  to  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance, as may be required by
  regulation.
    (g)  Certification.--Every  return  shall  have  annexed   thereto   a
  certification  by  the  president,  vice-president, treasurer, assistant
  treasurer,  chief  accounting  officer  or  any  other  officer  of  the
  petroleum  business  duly  authorized  so  to  act  where such petroleum
  business  is  a  corporation,  or  of  the  individual  or  one  of  the
  individuals,  or  members  of  the partnership making the same where the
  petroleum business is an unincorporated business, to the effect that the
  statements contained therein are true. The  fact  that  an  individual's
  name  is  signed  on  a certification of the return shall be prima facie
  evidence that such individual is authorized  to  sign  and  certify  the
  return on behalf of the petroleum business. Blank forms of returns shall
  be   furnished   by   the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance,  on
  application, but failure to secure such a blank shall  not  release  any
  petroleum  business from the obligation of making any return required by
  this article.
    (h) Action by attorney general.--An action may be brought at any  time
  by  the attorney general at the instance of the commissioner of taxation
  and finance, in the name of the state, to compel the filing  of  returns
  due under this article.
    (i)  Returns  and records.--Returns shall be preserved for five years,
  and thereafter until the commissioner of  taxation  and  finance  orders
  them to be destroyed. Every petroleum business subject to tax under this


 article  shall keep the records and documents referred to in subdivision
  one of section two hundred eighty-six of this  chapter  and  such  other
  records  of  its  business in such form as the commissioner may require;
  moreover,  the  records  required of transporters and storers under such
  subdivision shall apply with the same force and effect  to  transporters
  and storers of any product included in the measure of the tax imposed by
  this  article. All such records shall be preserved for a period of three
  years, except that the commissioner may  consent  to  their  destruction
  within that period or may require that they be kept longer.
    * (j)  Every petroleum business subject to tax under this article that
  is also a distributor, as defined in section two hundred  eighty-two  of
  this  chapter,  must  charge  the  tax  imposed  by  this article to the
  purchaser on each gallon sold, unless otherwise  exempt.  If  the  taxes
  imposed  by  this  article have not already been assumed or paid by such
  petroleum business  on  any  quantity  of  such  fuel  for  any  reason,
  including, but not limited to, the expansion of such fuel as a result of
  temperature  fluctuation,  such petroleum business must remit such taxes
  to the commissioner on the return for the period in which such sale  was
  made.

   §  310.  Corporate  petroleum  businesses;  collection  of  taxes  and
  penalties.--(a) Designation for  service  of  process.--Every  petroleum
  business which is a corporation, except such a petroleum business having
  a  certificate  of  authority  under  section  two hundred twelve of the
  general corporation law or having authority to do business by virtue  of
  section  thirteen  hundred  five  of the business corporation law, shall
  file in the department of state a  certificate  of  designation  in  its
  corporate   name,   signed   and   acknowledged   by  its  president  or
  vice-president or its secretary or treasurer, under its corporate  seal,
  designating the secretary of state as its agent upon whom process in any
  action provided for by this article may be served within this state, and
  setting  forth  an  address to which the secretary of state shall mail a
  copy of any such process against such petroleum business  which  may  be
  served  upon  him. In case any such petroleum business shall have failed
  to file such certificate of designation, it  shall  be  deemed  to  have
  designated  the  secretary  of state as its agent upon whom such process
  against it may be served; and until a certificate of  designation  shall
  have  been  filed  such  a  petroleum  business  shall be deemed to have
  directed the secretary of state to mail copies of  process  served  upon
  him  to  such petroleum business at its last known office address within
  or without the state. When a certificate of designation has  been  filed
  by such a petroleum business the secretary of state shall mail copies of
  process  thereafter  served  upon  him  to the address set forth in such
  certificate. Any such petroleum business, from time to time, may  change
  the  address  to which the secretary of state is directed to mail copies
  of process, by filing a certificate to that effect executed, signed  and
  acknowledged  in  like  manner as a certificate of designation as herein
  provided.
    (b)  Service  of  process.--Service  of  process  upon  any  petroleum
  business  which  is a corporation (including any such petroleum business
  having a certificate of authority under section two  hundred  twelve  of
  the general corporation law or having authority to do business by virtue
  of  section  thirteen  hundred five of the business corporation law), in
  any action commenced at any time pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this
  article,  may be made by either (1) personally delivering to and leaving
  with the secretary of state, a deputy secretary of  state  or  with  any
  person  authorized  by  the  secretary  of state to receive such service
  duplicate copies thereof at the office of the department of state in the
  city of Albany, in which event the secretary of  state  shall  forthwith
  send by registered mail, return receipt requested, one of such copies to
  such  petroleum  business at the address designated by it or at its last
  known office address within or without  the  state,  or  (2)  personally
  delivering  to  and  leaving  with  the  secretary  of  state,  a deputy
  secretary of state or with any person authorized  by  the  secretary  of
  state  to  receive  such  service,  a  copy thereof at the office of the
  department of state in the city of  Albany  and  by  delivering  a  copy
  thereof  to,  and leaving such copy with, the president, vice-president,
  secretary,  assistant  secretary,  treasurer,  assistant  treasurer,  or
  cashier   of   such   petroleum  business,  or  the  officer  performing
  corresponding functions under another name, or a  director  or  managing
  agent of such petroleum business, personally without the state. Proof of
  such personal service without the state shall be filed with the clerk of
  the  court  in which the action is pending within thirty days after such
  service, and such service shall be complete ten days after proof thereof
  is filed.
    (c) Forfeiture penalty.--If any taxes, penalties or interest due under
  this  article  are  not  paid  by  a  petroleum  business  which  is   a
  corporation,  or  any  return  required is not filed by such a petroleum


 business, and the tax commission is satisfied that the failure  to  make
  such payment or file such return is intentional, it may so report to the
  attorney  general,  who shall immediately bring an action in the name of
  the  people of the state, for the forfeiture of the charter or franchise
  of any such petroleum business failing to make  such  payment,  or  file
  such  return,  and  if  it  be  found that such failure was intentional,
  judgment shall be rendered in such action for  the  forfeiture  of  such
  charter and for its dissolution if such petroleum business is a domestic
  corporation  and,  if  such petroleum business is a foreign corporation,
  for the annulment of its franchise to do business in this state.
    (d) Dissolution penalty.--Whenever any petroleum business which  is  a
  corporation (excepting those covered by subdivision (e) of this section)
  has  failed  to  file a return for a period of six consecutive months or
  has been delinquent in the payment of taxes for any six  taxable  months
  duly  assessed  pursuant  to  this article, all the authority and powers
  conferred on the commissioner of taxation and finance and the  secretary
  of  state  by section two hundred three-a of this chapter and all of the
  provisions of such section shall have full force and effect  in  respect
  of and shall be applicable to such a petroleum business.
    (e)  Annulment  penalty.--Whenever  any  petroleum business which is a
  foreign corporation has failed to file a return or has  been  delinquent
  in  the  payment of taxes duly assessed pursuant to this article for the
  periods of time specified in subdivision (d) of this  section,  all  the
  authority  and  powers  conferred  on  the  commissioner of taxation and
  finance and the secretary of state by section  two  hundred  three-b  of
  this  chapter  and all of the provisions of such section shall have full
  force and effect in respect  of  and  shall  be  applicable  to  such  a
  petroleum business.




   §  312.  Deposit and disposition of revenue.-- (a) Except as otherwise
  provided, of all taxes, interest and penalties collected or received  on
  or  after  April  first,  two  thousand  one,  from the taxes imposed by
  section three hundred one-a of this article, (i)  initially  eighty  and
  three-tenths  percent  shall  be deposited, as prescribed by subdivision
  (d) of section three hundred one-j of this article and (ii) nineteen and
  seven-tenths percent shall be  deposited  in  such  mass  transportation
  operating  assistance  fund  to  the  credit  of  the  metropolitan mass
  transportation   operating   assistance   account   and    the    public
  transportation  systems  operating  assistance  account  thereof  in the
  manner  provided  by  subdivision  eleven   of   section   one   hundred
  eighty-two-a  of  this  chapter. Provided, further that on or before the
  twenty-fifth day of each month commencing with April, two thousand  one,
  the  comptroller  shall  deduct  the  amount  of six hundred twenty-five
  thousand dollars prior to any  deposit  or  disposition  of  the  taxes,
  interest,  and  penalties collected or received pursuant to such section
  three hundred one-a and shall deposit such amount in the dedicated  fund
  accounts  pursuant  to subdivision (d) of section three hundred one-j of
  this article. Provided,  further,  that  commencing  January  fifteenth,
  nineteen hundred ninety-one, and on or before the tenth day of March and
  the  fifteenth  day of June and September of such year, the commissioner
  shall, based on information supplied by taxpayers and other  appropriate
  sources, estimate the amount of the utility credit authorized by section
  three hundred one-d of this article which has been accrued to reduce tax
  liability  under section one hundred eighty-six-a of this chapter during
  the period covered by such estimate and certify to the state comptroller
  such estimated amount. The comptroller shall forthwith, after  receiving
  such  certificate,  deduct the amount of such credit so certified by the
  commissioner prior to any deposit or disposition of the taxes,  interest
  and  penalties  collected  or  received  pursuant  to such section three
  hundred one-a and shall pay such amount so certified and  deducted  into
  the   state   treasury   to  the  credit  of  the  general  fund.  Also,
  subsequently, during the fiscal year when the commissioner becomes aware
  of changes or modifications with respect to  actual  credit  usage,  the
  commissioner  shall,  as  soon  as  practicable,  issue  a certification
  setting forth the amount of any required adjustment  to  the  amount  of
  actual   credit   usage   previously   certified.  After  receiving  the
  certificate of the commissioner with respect to actual credit  usage  or
  modification of the same, the comptroller shall forthwith adjust general
  fund receipts and the revenues to be deposited or disposed of under this
  article  to reflect the difference so certified by the commissioner. The
  commissioner shall not be liable for any overestimate  or  underestimate
  of the amount of the utility credit which has been accrued to reduce tax
  liability  under  such  section  one hundred eighty-six-a. Nor shall the
  commissioner be liable  for  any  inaccuracy  in  any  certificate  with
  respect  to  the  amount  of  such  credit actually used or any required
  adjustment with respect to actual credit  usage,  but  the  commissioner
  shall  as  soon  as  practicable after discovery of any error adjust the
  next certification under this section to reflect any such error.
    Prior to making deposits as provided in this section, the  comptroller
  shall  retain  such  amount  as  the  commissioner  may  determine to be
  necessary, subject to the approval of the director of  the  budget,  for
  reasonable  costs  of the department in administering and collecting the
  taxes  deposited  pursuant  to  this  section  and   for   refunds   and
  reimbursements  with respect to such taxes, out of which the comptroller
  shall pay any refunds or reimbursements of such taxes to which taxpayers
  shall be entitled.


   (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all  taxes,  interest,
  and  penalties  collected  or  received  on or after December first, two
  thousand seventeen from the taxes imposed by section three hundred one-e
  of this article shall be deposited in the aviation  purpose  account  of
  the  dedicated  highway  and  bridge  trust  fund established by section
  eighty-nine-b of the state finance law.




   §  313.  Limitation of time.--The provisions of the civil practice law
  and rules relative to the limitation of time of enforcing a civil remedy
  shall not apply to any proceeding or action  taken  to  levy,  appraise,
  assess,  determine  or  enforce  the  collection  of  any tax or penalty
  prescribed by this article; provided, however, that as to real estate in
  the hands of persons who are owners thereof who would be  purchasers  in
  good faith but for such tax or penalty and as to the lien on real estate
  of  mortgages held by persons who would be holders thereof in good faith
  but for such tax or penalty, all such taxes and penalties shall cease to
  be a lien on such real estate as  against  such  purchasers  or  holders
  after  the  expiration  of ten years from the date such taxes became due
  and payable. The limitations herein provided for shall not apply to  any
  transfer  from  a  petroleum  business  to a person with intent to avoid
  payment of any taxes, or where with like intent the transfer is made  to
  a  grantee,  or  any  subsequent  grantee  controlled  by such petroleum
  business or which has any community of interest with it, either  through
  stock ownership or otherwise.




   §  314.  Secrecy.--  (a)  General.--Except  in  accordance with proper
  judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for
  any tax commissioner, any officer  or  employee  of  the  department  of
  taxation  and  finance,  or any person who, pursuant to this section, is
  permitted to inspect any return, or to whom any information contained in
  any return is furnished, or any  person  engaged  or  retained  by  such
  department  on  an  independent contract basis, or any person who in any
  manner may acquire knowledge of the contents of a return filed  pursuant
  to  this  article,  to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of
  income or gross receipts or any particulars set forth  or  disclosed  in
  any  return under this article. The officers charged with the custody of
  such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of
  anything contained in them in any action or  proceeding  in  any  court,
  except  on  behalf  of  the  state  or  the commissioner of taxation and
  finance in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this  chapter
  or  in  any other action or proceeding involving the collection of a tax
  due under this chapter to which the state or the commissioner is a party
  or a claimant, or on behalf of any party to  any  action  or  proceeding
  under  the  provisions  of  this article when the returns or facts shown
  thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding,  in  any  of
  which  events  the court may require the production of, and may admit in
  evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby  as  are
  pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. The commissioner may,
  nevertheless,  publish  a  copy  or  a  summary  of any determination or
  decision rendered after the formal hearing provided for in this chapter.
  Nothing herein  shall  be  construed  to  prohibit  the  delivery  to  a
  petroleum  business  or  its duly authorized representative of a copy of
  any return filed by it, nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so
  classified as to prevent the identification of  particular  returns  and
  the  items  thereof,  or the publication of delinquent lists showing the
  names of petroleum businesses who have failed to pay their taxes at  the
  time  and  in the manner provided by section three hundred eight of this
  article together with any relevant information which in the  opinion  of
  the  commissioner may assist in the collection of such delinquent taxes;
  or the inspection by the attorney general or other legal representatives
  of the state of the return of any petroleum business which  shall  bring
  action  to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an
  action or proceeding under this chapter  has  been  recommended  by  the
  commissioner  or  the  attorney  general  or has been instituted; or the
  inspection of the returns of any petroleum business by  the  comptroller
  or  duly designated officer or employee of the state department of audit
  and control, for purposes of the audit of a refund of any  tax  paid  by
  such  petroleum  business under this article. Provided, further, nothing
  herein shall  be  construed  to  prohibit  the  disclosure  of  taxpayer
  identity  information,  including  name,  mailing  address  and taxpayer
  identifying number (social security account number, or such other number
  as has been assigned by the secretary of the United States  treasury  or
  his  delegate,  or  by  the  commissioner of taxation and finance), with
  respect to persons who are registered as residual petroleum  product  or
  aviation  fuel businesses under this article or as distributors of motor
  fuel or diesel motor fuel or kero-jet  fuel  only  for  the  purpose  of
  article  twelve-A of this chapter or this article, whose registration as
  a residual petroleum product business or as such  distributor  has  been
  cancelled or suspended pursuant to this article or such article twelve-A
  or  whose  application  for registration as a residual petroleum product
  business or as such  distributor  has  been  refused  pursuant  to  this
  article  or  such  article  twelve-A.  In addition, the commissioner may
  disclose the fact  that  a  person  is  not  registered  as  a  residual


 petroleum business under this article or as a distributor of motor fuel,
  diesel  motor  fuel or kero-jet fuel only under article twelve-A of this
  chapter. Information disclosed pursuant to this subdivision  shall  not,
  by itself, be construed as proof of compliance or noncompliance with the
  provisions of this chapter.
    (b)  Penalty  for violation.--(1) Any officer or employee of the state
  who willfully violates the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section
  shall be dismissed from office and be incapable of  holding  any  public
  office in this state for a period of five years thereafter.
    (2)  Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see article thirty-seven
  of this chapter.
    (c) Exceptions regarding the United States, other states  and  certain
  municipal  proceedings.--Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision
  (a) of this section, the tax commission may permit the secretary of  the
  treasury of the United States or his delegates, or the proper officer of
  any  other  state  charged  with  tax  administration, or the authorized
  representative of either such officer,  to  inspect  the  returns  filed
  under  this  article,  or  may furnish to such officer or his authorized
  representative an abstract of any  such  return  or  supply  information
  concerning  an  item  contained  in  any such return, or disclosed by an
  investigation of tax liability under this article, but  such  permission
  shall  be  granted  or such information furnished to such officer or his
  representative only if the laws of the United States or  of  such  other
  state, as the case may be, grant substantially similar privileges to the
  commission  or  officer of this state charged with the administration of
  the tax imposed by this article and such information is to be  used  for
  tax purposes only; and provided further the commissioner of taxation and
  finance  may  furnish  to  the  secretary  of the treasury of the United
  States or his delegates such returns filed under this article and  other
  tax  information, as he may consider proper, for use in court actions or
  proceedings under the internal revenue code whether civil  or  criminal,
  where  a  written  request therefor has been made to the commissioner of
  taxation and finance by the secretary of the treasury or  his  delegates
  provided  the  laws  of  the  United  States grant substantially similar
  powers to the secretary of the treasury  or  his  delegates.  Where  the
  commissioner of taxation and finance has so authorized use of returns or
  other  tax  information  in  such  actions  or proceedings, officers and
  employees of the department of taxation and finance may testify in  such
  actions  or  proceedings  in  respect  to  such  returns  or  other  tax
  information; and provided further that such commission may  furnish  any
  municipality  with such information contained in the returns filed under
  this article as it may consider proper for  use  in  any  certiorari  or
  condemnation proceeding.
    (d)  Exceptions  regarding  city  income  taxes.--Notwithstanding  the
  provisions of subdivision (a) of this section, the  tax  commission  may
  permit  the  officer  charged  with  the administration of an income tax
  imposed by any city  of  the  state  of  New  York,  or  the  authorized
  representative  of such officer, to inspect the returns filed under this
  article, or may furnish to such officer or his authorized representative
  an abstract of any such return or supply information concerning an  item
  contained  in  any such return, or disclosed by any investigation of tax
  liability under this article, but such permission shall  be  granted  or
  such information furnished to such officer or his representative only if
  the  local  laws  of such city grant substantially similar privileges to
  the commission or officer of this state charged with the  administration
  of  the  tax  imposed by this article and such information is to be used
  for tax purposes only; and provided further the commissioner of taxation
  and finance may furnish to such city officer or his  delegates  and  the


 legal  representative of such city such returns filed under this article
  and other tax information, as he may consider proper, for use  in  court
  actions  or proceedings under such local law, whether civil or criminal,
  where  a  written  request therefor has been made to the commissioner of
  taxation and finance by such city officer or his delegates  or  by  such
  legal  representative  of such city, provided the local law of such city
  grants substantially similar powers to the city officer charged with the
  administration of the city  income  tax  or  his  delegates.  Where  the
  commissioner of taxation and finance has so authorized use of returns or
  other  tax  information  in  such  actions  or proceedings, officers and
  employees of the department of taxation and finance may testify in  such
  actions  or  proceedings  in  respect  to  such  returns  or  other  tax
  information.
    (e) Exceptions regarding depositories.--Notwithstanding the provisions
  of subdivision (a) of this section, the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance, in such commissioner's discretion, may require or permit any or

  make payment of any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this article  to
  banks,  banking houses or trust companies designated by the commissioner
  and to file returns with such banks, banking houses or  trust  companies
  as  agents  of  the  commissioner,  in  lieu  of making any such payment
  directly to the commissioner. However, the commissioner shall  designate
  only  such  banks,  banking houses or trust companies as are or shall be
  designated by the comptroller as depositories pursuant to section  three
  hundred twelve of this article.
    (f)  Disclosure  of  certain information where more than one person is
  subject to penalty. If the commissioner  determines  that  a  person  is
  liable  for  a  penalty  under  subdivision  two  of section two hundred
  eighty-nine-b of this chapter  (as  applicable  to  this  article  under
  section  three  hundred  fifteen  of  this  article) with respect to any
  failure, upon request in writing of such person, the commissioner  shall
  disclose in writing to such person (1) the name of any other person whom
  the  commissioner  has  determined  to  be  liable for such penalty with
  respect to such failure, and (2) whether the commissioner has  attempted
  to  collect  such  penalty from such other person, the general nature of
  such collection activities, and the amount collected.

  United   States   Congress.--(1)   Notwithstanding   the  provisions  of

  however  that,  prior  to  furnishing any return, the commissioner shall
  redact any copy of a federal return (or portion thereof) attached to, or
  any information on a federal return that is reflected on,  such  return,
  and any social security numbers, account numbers and residential address
  information.
    (2)  No returns shall be furnished pursuant to this subdivision unless
  the chairperson of the requesting committee certifies  in  writing  that
  such  returns  have  been requested related to, and in furtherance of, a
  legitimate task of the Congress, that the requesting committee has  made
  a  written  request  to  the United States secretary of the treasury for
  related federal returns or return information,  pursuant  to  26  U.S.C.
  Section  6103(f),  and  that  if such requested returns are inspected by

  shall  apply  to the administration of and procedure with respect to the

  incorporated in full into this article and had expressly referred to the
  tax  under this article, except to the extent that any such provision is
  either inconsistent with a provision of this article or is not  relevant
  to  this  article  or  that  the provisions of such article twelve-A are

  in  part, of the taxes imposed by articles twelve-A and twenty-eight and
  pursuant to the authority of article twenty-nine of  this  chapter  upon
  motor  fuel and diesel motor fuel and the taxes imposed by this article,
  including the joint reporting, assessment, collection, determination and
  refund of such taxes, and for that purpose to prescribe that any of  the
  commissioner's  functions  under  such articles, and any returns, forms,

  under such articles, shall be on a joint basis with respect to the taxes

  eighty-five-a and subdivision one of section two  hundred  eighty-nine-c
  of this chapter shall apply to the taxes imposed under this article with
  the  same  force and effect as if those provisions specifically referred
  to the taxes imposed hereunder and all  the  products  with  respect  to
  which  the  taxes  are  imposed under this article. Provided, further, a
  reimbursement (or credit) of taxes imposed under this article  shall  be

  in  order  to preserve the revenue from the tax imposed by this article,
  shall, by regulation, require that the movement  of  residual  petroleum
  product  into  or  in  this state be accompanied by a tracking document.
  Also,  the  commissioner  may  require  (i)  that  any  returns,  forms,

  fuel required of transporters or terminal operators under  such  article
  twelve-A of this chapter apply with the same force and effect to persons
  transporting or storing residual petroleum product, (ii) a certification
  that  particular  gallonage of motor fuel, diesel motor fuel or residual

   §  421.  Registration  of  distributors. 1. General. The commissioner,

  registered,  shall  make  any  sale  of  alcoholic beverages within this
  state, except a sale, if any, as to which this state is without power to
  impose such condition. No person, unless so registered, shall (i) import
  or cause any liquors to be imported in this state for sale or use within

  purchase then cause liquors covered by such receipt to be removed from a
  warehouse in this state or (iii) except in accordance with clause (i) or
  (ii) of paragraph (b) of subdivision four of section four hundred twenty
  of this article, produce, distill, manufacture, compound, mix or ferment
  any such liquors within this state for sale. Provided, however, that the
  commissioner  may  exclude from registration requirements any person who
  is a distributor of liquors solely by reason  of  the  importation  into
  this  state  of  no more than ninety liters of liquors during a one-year
  period for such person's personal use and consumption to register  as  a
  distributor   with   respect  to  liquor.  Provided,  further,  that  an
  abbreviated registration in the from of a permit, without a bond, may be
  instituted by the  commissioner  for  the  purpose  of  authorizing  the
  importation of up to three hundred sixty liters of liquors per year into
  this  state  by  an  individual  for  such individual's personal use and
  consumption in this state.
    2.  Temporary  restraining  order  and  permanent  injunction  against
  unlawful importation and a forfeiture of unlawfully imported or produced
  liquors.    (a)  In  an  action  commenced  pursuant to this subdivision
  whenever evidence is furnished by the commissioner showing a substantial
  likelihood that a person not registered as a distributor as required  by
  this  article  has  imported  or  may  import liquors into this state or
  caused or may cause liquors to be imported into this state for  sale  or
  use  in this state or has produced, distilled, manufactured, compounded,
  mixed or fermented or may produce, distill, manufacture,  compound,  mix
  or  ferment  liquors  within  the  state or, pursuant to a purchase of a
  warehouse receipt, has caused or  may  cause  liquors  covered  by  such
  receipt  to be removed from a warehouse in this state, the court, taking
  into consideration the fungible nature  of  such  liquors,  may  make  a
  temporary  order  without  notice prohibiting such person and his agents
  from selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of any liquors or  any
  liquors  and  also  prohibiting  all  other  persons in possession of or
  having control over the same from selling,  releasing,  transferring  or
  otherwise  disposing  of  any liquors imported or caused to be imported,
  produced, distilled, manufactured, compounded, mixed or fermented,  sold
  or  transferred  or  removed  by such person not so registered pending a
  hearing for a preliminary injunction.
    (b) Upon granting a temporary order, the court  shall  direct  that  a
  hearing  be  held  at  the  earliest  possible time upon such notice and
  service as the court shall direct. Where, after such opportunity  for  a
  hearing,  the  court  determines  that  there  is  a likelihood that the
  commissioner will  prevail  in  such  action,  the  court  may  grant  a
  preliminary  injunction restraining the sale, release, transfer or other
  disposition of liquors subject to the temporary order.
    (c) (1) Whenever the commissioner shall discover that any  person  not
  registered  as  a  distributor  as required by this article has imported


 liquors into this state or caused liquors to be imported into this state
  for sale or use in this state or has produced, distilled,  manufactured,
  compounded,  mixed or fermented liquors within the state or, pursuant to
  a  purchase  of  a warehouse receipt, has caused liquors covered by such
  receipt to be removed from a warehouse in this state,  the  commissioner
  may  commence  an action in supreme court for a permanent injunction and
  forfeiture of liquors. If it is established by a  preponderance  of  the
  evidence  that  liquors were imported or caused to be imported into this
  state  for  sale  or  use  in  this  state,  were  produced,  distilled,
  manufactured,  compounded,  mixed  or  fermented,  or  were caused to be
  removed from a warehouse in this state by the purchaser of  a  warehouse
  receipt  with respect to such liquors, by any person not registered as a
  distributor, as required by  this  article,  the  court  shall  grant  a
  judgment  (i)  permanently  enjoining  such  person  and his agents from
  selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of any such liquors or  any
  liquors  within  this  state  and  (ii)  declaring the forfeiture of any
  liquors  that  were  so  imported,  caused  to  be  imported,  produced,
  distilled, manufactured, compounded, mixed, fermented or removed by such
  person.
    (2) With respect to liquors that were imported, caused to be imported,
  produced,  distilled,  manufactured,  compounded,  mixed,  fermented  or
  removed by a person not registered as a distributor as required by  this
  article  or  that were unlawfully sold or transferred by such person, if
  it is established by a preponderance of  the  evidence  that  any  other
  person  in  possession  of or having control over such liquors was not a
  purchaser or transferee in good faith of such liquors  with  respect  to
  the  fact  that  such  liquors  were so imported, caused to be imported,
  produced,  distilled,  manufactured,  compounded,  mixed,  fermented  or
  removed  by a person not registered as a distributor as required by this
  article or that such liquors were so unlawfully sold or  transferred  by
  such  person, the court shall grant a judgment (i) permanently enjoining
  such other person and such  person's  agents  from  selling,  releasing,
  transferring  or  otherwise  disposing  of  any  such  liquors  and (ii)
  declaring the forfeiture of such liquors in the possession or under  the
  control of such other person.
    (d)  The  commissioner  may, at any time subsequent to the granting of
  the temporary order pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision,  with
  the  approval of the court, consent to a sale of liquors subject to such
  temporary order which is in the possession or under  the  control  of  a
  person  other  than  the person or the agent of the person who imported,
  caused to be imported, produced,  distilled,  manufactured,  compounded,
  mixed,  fermented,  removed  or  unlawfully  sold  or  transferred  such
  liquors. As a condition of granting permission  to  a  sale  of  liquors
  pursuant to this subdivision, the commissioner shall require the payment
  of  all  taxes,  penalties  and  interest imposed by and pursuant to the
  authority of this chapter with respect to such liquors.
    (e) (1) At any time during  the  pendency  of  an  action  under  this
  section,  the  liquors  subject to a temporary, preliminary or permanent
  order hereunder may be released from the scope of such order if there is
  given an undertaking, in an amount equal to the  market  value  of  such
  liquors  plus  any  excise,  state  and  local sales and use and federal
  excise taxes, to the effect that there will be paid to the  commissioner
  the  amount  of  the  market value of such liquors and such taxes in the
  event that such liquors are adjudged forfeited.
    (2) Any  person  enjoined  by  a  temporary  order  or  a  preliminary
  injunction   issued   pursuant  to  this  subdivision  or  other  person
  interested in any such liquors may move at any time, on  notice  to  all
  parties, to vacate or modify it.


   (f)  The  procedures of the civil practice law and rules applicable to
  temporary restraining  orders,  preliminary  injunctions  and  permanent
  injunctions  not  inconsistent  with  this  subdivision  shall  apply to
  temporary orders,  preliminary  injunctions  and  permanent  injunctions
  issued  under  this  subdivision. The procedural provisions set forth in
  paragraph three of subdivision (d) and in  subdivision  (j)  of  section
  eighteen   hundred  forty-five  of  this  chapter  shall  apply  to  the
  forfeiture proceedings under this  subdivision  and,  in  respect  to  a
  declaration  of  forfeiture under this subdivision, the court may direct
  the commissioner to sell or otherwise dispose of such forfeited  liquors
  on  such  conditions  the  commissioner deems most advantageous and just
  under the circumstances. The commissioner shall not be required to  file
  any   undertaking   in  connection  with  an  action  pursuant  to  this
  subdivision.




   §  422.  Bonds  of  distributors.  The  tax commission may require any
  distributor to file with the department of taxation and finance  a  bond
  issued  by  a surety company approved by the superintendent of financial
  services as to solvency and responsibility and  authorized  to  transact
  business   in  the  state  or  other  security  acceptable  to  the  tax
  commission, in such amount as the tax commission may fix, to secure  the
  payment  of any sums due from such distributor pursuant to this article.
  The tax commission may require that such a bond  or  other  security  be
  filed  before  a  distributor  is registered, or at any time when in its
  judgment the same is necessary as a protection  to  the  revenues  under
  this  article.  If  securities  are  deposited  as  security  under this
  subdivision, such securities shall be kept in the joint custody  of  the
  comptroller and the commissioner of taxation and finance and may be sold
  by  the  tax  commission  if  it  becomes necessary so to do in order to
  recover any sums due from such distributor pursuant to this article; but
  no such sale shall be had until after such distributor  shall  have  had
  opportunity  to  litigate the validity of any tax if it elects so to do.
  Upon any such sale, the surplus, if any, above the sums due  under  this
  article, shall be returned to such distributor.




   §  423. Cancellation of registration of distributors. The registration
  of any distributor may be cancelled by the commissioner upon its failure
  to file a bond or other security when required, and the registration  of
  a  distributor  may be cancelled by the commissioner upon its failure to
  comply with any of the provisions of  this  article  or  any  reasonable
  requirement,  rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this article by the
  department of taxation and finance  or  by  the  commissioner.  All  the
  provisions  of  subdivisions  four  through six and eight through ten of
  section  two  hundred  eighty-three  of   this   chapter   relating   to
  registration  of  distributors  of motor fuel shall be applicable to the
  registration of distributors under this article with the same force  and
  effect as if the language of those subdivisions had been incorporated in
  full  in  this section and had expressly referred to the registration of
  distributors under this article and the tax  imposed  by  this  article,
  with  such  modification  as  may  be  necessary  in  order to adapt the
  language of such provisions to the provisions of this article, provided,
  specifically, that the term "motor fuel" shall  be  read  as  "alcoholic
  beverages".   Provided,  however,  a  registration  shall  be  cancelled
  immediately, upon cancellation or revocation  for  cause  of  a  license
  under   the   alcoholic   beverage  control  law.  A  distributor  shall
  immediately inform the department in writing of any change in  its  name
  or  address,  and  a  corporate distributor shall immediately inform the
  department, in writing, of any change in its name, or in its officers or
  directors, or their residence addresses.




   §  424.  Taxes  imposed.  1.  There are hereby levied and imposed on a
  distributor and a noncommercial importer excise taxes at  the  following
  rates:
    (a) Fourteen cents per gallon upon beers;
    (b) Thirty  cents per gallon upon still wines, except cider containing
  more than three and two-tenths per centum of  alcohol  by  volume,  upon
  which  the  tax  shall  be  three  and seventy-nine hundredths cents per
  gallon;
    (c) Thirty cents per gallon  upon  artificially  carbonated  sparkling
  wines,  except  artificially  carbonated sparkling cider containing more
  than three and two-tenths per centum of alcohol by  volume,  upon  which
  the tax shall be three and seventy-nine hundredths cents per gallon;
    (d) Thirty  cents  per  gallon  upon  natural  sparkling wines, except
  natural sparkling cider containing more than three  and  two-tenths  per
  centum  of  alcohol  by  volume,  upon  which the tax shall be three and
  seventy-nine hundredths cents per gallon;
    (e) Sixty-seven cents per liter upon liquors containing not more  than
  twenty-four  per  centum  of alcohol by volume except liquors containing
  not more than two per centum of alcohol by volume, upon  which  the  tax
  shall be zero; and
    (f)  One  dollar  and  seventy cents per liter upon all other liquors;
  when sold or used within this state, except when sold or used under such
  circumstances that this state is without power to  impose  such  tax  or
  when  sold  to  the  United States and except beers when sold to or by a
  voluntary unincorporated organization of the armed forces of the  United
  States  operating  a place for the sale of goods pursuant to regulations
  promulgated by the appropriate executive agency of the United States, to
  the  extent  provided  in  such  regulations,  directives   and   policy
  statements  of  such an agency applicable to such sales, and except when
  sold to professional foreign consuls-general, consuls  and  vice-consuls
  who  are  nationals of the state appointing them and who are assigned to
  foreign consulates  in  this  state,  provided  that  American  consular
  officers  of  equal  rank  who are citizens of the United States and who
  exercise their official functions at American consulates in such foreign
  country are granted reciprocal exemptions; provided, however,  that  the
  commissioner  may  permit the sale of alcohol without tax to a holder of
  any industrial alcohol permit, alcohol permit or  alcohol  distributor's
  permit,  issued  by  the state liquor authority, and by the holder of an
  alcohol distributor's permit, class A, issued by  such  authority  to  a
  holder of a distiller's license, class B, or a winery license, issued by
  such  authority  and  may also permit the use of alcohol for any purpose
  other than the production of alcoholic beverages by such holders without
  tax; provided also that the commissioner may permit the  sale  of  cider
  without  tax  by  a  holder  of a cider producer's license issued by the
  state liquor authority to a holder of a cider producer's  license  or  a
  cider wholesaler's license issued by such authority.
    (g)  For  purposes  of  this  chapter, it is presumed that liquors are
  possessed for the purpose of sale in  this  state  if  the  quantity  of
  liquors  possessed in this state, imported or caused to be imported into
  this state or produced, distilled, manufactured,  compounded,  mixed  or
  fermented  in  this state exceeds ninety liters. Such presumption may be
  rebutted by the introduction of substantial evidence to the contrary. In
  any case where the quantity of alcoholic beverages taxable  pursuant  to
  this  article  is  a  fractional part of one liter (or one gallon in the
  case of beers) or an amount greater than a whole multiple of liters  (or
  gallons  in  the case of beers), the amount of tax levied and imposed on
  such fractional part of one liter (or one gallon in the case of  beers),
  or  fractional part of a liter (or gallon) in excess of a whole multiple


 of liters or gallons shall be such fractional part of the  rate  imposed
  by paragraphs (a) through (f).
    Notwithstanding  any other provision of this article, the commissioner
  may permit the purchase of alcoholic beverages without tax by  a  person
  registered  as  a  distributor  under section four hundred twenty-one of
  this article from another person  so  registered,  in  which  event  the
  alcoholic beverage so purchased shall be subject to the taxes imposed by
  this article in the hands of the purchaser in the same manner and to the
  same  extent  as if such purchaser had imported or caused the same to be
  imported into this  state  or  had  produced,  distilled,  manufactured,
  brewed, compounded, mixed or fermented the same within this state.
    2. Such taxes shall be due on the twentieth day of the month following
  the  month  in  which  such alcoholic beverages are sold or used by such
  distributor or noncommercial importer, regardless of whether  or  not  a
  return is filed as required by this article.
    3.  Beers  within this state when chapter one hundred forty-two of the
  laws of nineteen hundred thirty-three took  effect,  wines  within  this
  state  when  chapter  two  hundred  twenty-three of the laws of nineteen
  hundred thirty-three took effect and  liquors  within  this  state  when
  chapter   eight  hundred  eighteen  of  the  laws  of  nineteen  hundred
  thirty-three took effect shall also be subject to such taxes  when  sold
  within  this  state  or  used for commercial purposes within this state,
  except as provided for in subdivision one of this  section,  unless  the
  taxes imposed by said chapters shall have been paid with respect to such
  alcoholic beverages prior to April second, nineteen hundred thirty-four,
  and  the  person  selling or commercially using such alcoholic beverages
  shall be deemed a distributor for the purposes of this article; and such
  alcoholic beverages shall be subject to all of the  provisions  of  this
  article  to  the  same extent as if the same had been imported into this
  state or produced, distilled, manufactured, brewed, compounded, mixed or
  fermented within this state after such chapters  became  effective.  If,
  prior  to  the  taking  effect  of  such chapters, a contract of sale of
  alcoholic beverages was made, and  delivery  thereof  pursuant  to  such
  contract  is  made  within this state on or after April second, nineteen
  hundred thirty-four, from a stock of alcoholic beverages which  is  then
  subject  to the taxing power of this state, the vendor shall be deemed a
  distributor for  the  purposes  of  this  article,  and  such  alcoholic
  beverages  shall  be  deemed  to  be  sold, and shall be subject to such
  taxes, at the time of such delivery, unless such taxes shall  have  been
  paid  with  respect  to  such alcoholic beverages prior to April second,
  nineteen hundred thirty-four.
    4. (a) Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  this  article,  there
  shall  be  exempt  from the taxes imposed under this article, per month,
  one-quart of alcoholic beverages (or one gallon of such beverages in the
  case of a person arriving directly or indirectly  from  American  Samoa,
  Guam  or the Virgin Islands of the United States not more than one-quart
  of which shall  have  been  acquired  elsewhere  than  in  such  insular
  possessions):
    (i)  purchased  outside  this  state  as an incident to a journey from
  which the purchaser is returning and
    (ii) not to be offered for sale or used for  any  commercial  purpose,
  provided such alcoholic beverages accompany such person on his return to
  this  state and provided, further, that in the case of a person arriving
  in this state from other than a state of the  United  States  (including
  the  district of Columbia), the Virgin Islands of the United States or a
  contiguous country maintaining a free zone or  free  port,  such  person
  shall  have  remained beyond the territorial limits of the United States
  for a period of not less than forty-eight hours.


   (b) Provided, however, where the amounts purchased outside this  state
  or  brought  in  exceed  the  amounts specified in paragraph (a) of this
  subdivision but are not in excess of  one  liter  in  the  case  of  the
  references  to  one-quart or four liters in the case of the reference to
  one  gallon,  and  where  no  duty is required by the laws of the United
  States to be paid on such amounts, such metric standards of  fill  shall
  be  substituted  for  one-quart  and  one gallon, respectively, and such
  amounts shall be exempt from tax under the conditions  provided  for  in
  paragraph (a) of this subdivision.
    5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, there shall be
  exempt  from  the  taxes imposed under this article, the sale of wine at
  retail in sealed containers to a regularly organized  church,  synagogue
  or  religious  organization for sacramental purposes, provided such wine
  shall have been purchased in this state  from  a  distributor,  and  the
  purchaser shall have given the distributor a written statement signed by
  such  purchaser setting forth its name and address, its declaration that
  it is a regularly organized church, synagogue or religious  organization
  and  that  the  wine  purchased  shall  be  used  solely for sacramental
  purposes and any other information or proof that the tax commission  may
  require.  Where  such  a  statement  shall  have  been  furnished to the
  distributor by a  purchaser  which  shall  not  have  been  a  regularly
  organized  church, synagogue or religious organization or the wine shall
  be for other than  sacramental  purposes,  and  in  reliance  upon  such
  statement  the  wine shall not have been included as taxable in a return
  made by a distributor, the purchaser shall file a return and pay the tax
  in the manner provided for in section four hundred twenty-nine.
    6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, there shall be
  exempt from the taxes imposed under this  article,  alcoholic  beverages
  furnished  by a licensed producer of alcoholic beverages at no charge to
  a customer or prospective customer at a tasting held in accordance  with
  the alcoholic beverage control law for consumption at such tasting.




   §  425.  Special  provision  as  to  imposition  of  taxes  on certain
  alcoholic beverages. If a person shall receive any  alcoholic  beverages
  from  the  distributor with respect thereto, under such circumstances so
  as to preclude the collection of the taxes under this  article,  because
  this  state  was  without  power to impose such taxes under this article
  against such distributor by reason of the constitution or the law of the
  United States enacted pursuant thereto or the constitution  or  laws  of
  this  state,  and  such  person  shall  thereafter  sell or use any such
  alcoholic beverages in such manner and under such circumstances  as  may
  subject  the  same to the taxing power of this state with respect to any
  sale or use thereof, such person shall be liable for the tax imposed  by
  section  four  hundred twenty-four with respect to such sale or use, and
  shall make the same reports and returns,  pay  the  same  taxes  and  be
  subject  to  the other applicable provisions of this article relating to
  distributors, except that with respect to beers and wines such a  person
  shall  not  be  subject  to  the  provisions  of  sections  four hundred
  twenty-one and four hundred twenty-two of this article  if  such  person
  does  not  offer such alcoholic beverages for sale or use such alcoholic
  beverages for any commercial purpose. Provided,  further,  that  if  the
  taxing  power  of  this  state does not extend to the imposition of such
  taxes on, and the requirement of payment of such taxes by,  such  person
  selling  or  using such beverages, then such person shall be required to
  collect such taxes from its purchaser on the sale of such beverages  and
  to  pay  over  such  taxes  to the commissioner. In such event, the same
  reports and returns relating to  distributors,  along  with  remittance,
  shall  be  required  by such person and all the other provisions of this
  article relating to distributors shall apply. If such taxes are  not  so
  collected,  then such purchaser shall, along with such person, be liable
  for such taxes.




   §  425-a.  Presumption  of  taxability.  For the purpose of the proper
  administration of the taxes imposed  by  this  article  and  to  prevent
  evasion  thereof, it shall be presumed with respect to this chapter that
  all alcoholic beverages possessed or found in this state are subject  to
  the  taxes  imposed by this article until the contrary is established by
  substantial evidence. Except with respect to a  purchase  at  retail  of
  beers  or  wines  and  a  purchase at retail of ninety liters or less of
  liquors, no person shall purchase  alcoholic  beverages  in  this  state
  unless  the taxes imposed by this article with respect to such beverages
  have been assumed by a distributor registered under this article or paid
  by such distributor pursuant  to  and  in  accordance  with  the  manner
  provided  herein  and  evidenced  in accordance with the manner provided
  herein. In the case of  liquors,  such  taxes  shall  be  assumed  by  a
  distributor   in   accordance   with   the  invoice  required,  and  the
  certification of  tax  payment  included  therein,  under  section  four
  hundred  twenty-seven  of  this  article; in the case of other alcoholic
  beverages, the taxes shall be assumed by such  distributor  pursuant  to
  and in accordance with the rules or regulations of the department.




   §  426.  Records  to be kept by brand owners, distributors, owners and
  others.  Every brand owner, distributor, owner  or  other  person  shall
  keep  a complete and accurate record of all purchases and sales or other
  dispositions of alcoholic beverages, and a complete and accurate  record
  of  the  number  of  gallons  of beers produced, manufactured, brewed or
  fermented  and  liters  of  all  other  alcoholic  beverages   produced,
  distilled,  manufactured,  brewed,  compounded, mixed or fermented. Such
  records shall be in such form and contain such other information as  the
  tax  commission shall prescribe. Said commission, by rule or regulation,
  also may require the delivery of statements to purchasers  of  alcoholic
  beverages,  and  prescribe  the  matters  to  be contained therein. Such
  records and statements, unless required by  the  tax  commission  to  be
  preserved  for  a  longer period, shall be preserved for a period of one
  year and shall be offered for  inspection  at  any  time  upon  oral  or
  written  demand  by the commissioner of taxation and finance or his duly
  authorized agents, and every such distributor,  brand  owner,  owner  or
  other  person  shall make such reports to the department of taxation and
  finance as may be required  by  the  tax  commission.  Nothing  in  this
  section  contained shall be construed to require the keeping of a record
  of the purchase or disposition of  alcoholic  beverages  by  a  consumer
  thereof,  except  by a person who uses the same for commercial purposes,
  or of the sale of alcoholic beverages at retail.




   §  427.  Requirement and content of invoice on the sale of liquors. 1.
  Every sale of liquors, except a sale at retail of ninety liters or less,
  shall be evidenced by and recorded on an individual,  serially  numbered
  invoice,  and,  with respect to each such sale, the seller therein shall
  make and complete such  invoice  which  shall  contain  the  information
  required  by this section and give the same to the purchaser at the time
  of delivery. The seller shall sign and date the invoice required by this
  section and certify the entire content of such invoice.
    2. Each invoice required by subdivision  one  of  this  section  shall
  state separately thereon:
    (a) the identifying number of such invoice;
    (b) the name of the seller;
    (c)  the  current  state liquor authority number of the seller and, if
  registered  as  a  distributor,  the  registration  number  (certificate
  number)  assigned  to  such  seller  by  the department must also be set
  forth;
    (d) the address of  the  licensed  premises  of  the  seller  and,  if
  different from such premises, the address of the premises from which the
  liquors  listed  on  such  invoice  were  removed  for  delivery  to the
  purchaser;
    (e) the name of the purchaser;
    (f) the current state liquor authority number of the purchaser;
    (g) the date of the delivery of the liquors;
    (h) the address of the licensed premises  of  the  purchaser  and,  if
  different  from  such premises, the address of the premises to which the
  liquors listed on such invoice are to be delivered by the seller;
    (i) the size (in liters) and number of bottles of  liquors  sold,  and
  its description, by brand name and price; and
    (j) a certification with respect to tax payment to the effect that:
    (i)  in  the  case  of  a transaction with respect to which a city tax
  imposed pursuant to section four  hundred  forty-five  of  this  article
  applies,  that  is, where the sale is made to a purchaser whose licensed
  premises are within such city or is completed by delivery to a purchaser
  in such city:
    (A) if the seller is a distributor of liquors  registered  under  this
  article, that the seller has assumed payment of or has paid all New York
  state  and  city  alcoholic  beverage  taxes with respect to the liquors
  which are the subject of such transaction; or
    (B) if such seller is not a registered distributor under this article,
  that  such  taxes  have  been  assumed  by  or  paid  by  an  identified
  distributor  registered  under  this  article as evidenced by an invoice
  received by the seller pursuant to this  section  with  respect  to  the
  liquors being sold and accepted in good faith by such seller; or
    (C)  where  either  or both New York state and city alcoholic beverage
  taxes have not been paid, the seller shall set forth this fact  and,  if
  applicable,  a statement of the exemption from tax which applies to such
  sale; and
    (ii) with respect to a transaction to which subparagraph (i)  of  this
  paragraph does not apply:
    (A)  if  the  seller is a distributor of liquors registered under this
  article, that such seller has assumed payment of or  has  paid  all  New
  York  state  alcoholic  beverage  taxes  imposed under this article with
  respect to the liquors which are the subject of such transaction; or
    (B) if such seller is not a registered  distributor,  that  the  taxes
  have  been  assumed  by  or paid by an identified distributor registered
  under this article as evidenced  by  an  invoice  given  to  the  seller
  pursuant  to  this  section  with  respect to the liquors being sold and
  accepted in good faith by such seller; or


   (C) where the  state  alcoholic  beverage  taxes  imposed  under  this
  article  have  not  been  paid  with respect to such liquors, the seller
  shall set forth this  fact  and,  if  applicable,  a  statement  of  the
  exemption from tax which applies to such sale; or
    (iii)  in the case of a transaction which is the first sale of liquors
  in this state where the seller is a distiller or the exclusive agent  of
  a  distiller  and both such seller and the purchaser are distributors of
  liquor registered under this article, the commissioner may provide  that
  such  distiller  or exclusive agent need not set forth the certification
  required by this paragraph on the invoice required by this section.
    3. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, every  seller  shall
  keep  a  duplicate original of the invoice required to be made and given
  to the purchaser for the period returns  are  required  to  be  retained
  pursuant to this article.
    4.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  to  the contrary, every purchaser
  shall keep the invoice given by the seller pursuant to this section  for
  the period returns are required to be retained pursuant to this article.
    5. For purposes of this chapter, where the invoice required under this
  section is not furnished by the seller at the time of delivery, or where
  a  person  in  possession  of liquors does not possess such invoice with
  respect to such liquors, it shall be presumed that the taxes imposed  by
  or  pursuant  to  this  article  have  not  been  assumed  or  paid by a
  distributor registered as such under this article. Such presumption  may
  be rebutted by the introduction of substantial evidence to the contrary.
  In  addition  to any other civil and criminal penalties which may apply,
  any person  who  purchases  alcoholic  beverages  without  receiving  an
  invoice from the seller as required by this section shall be jointly and
  severally liable to pay the taxes imposed by or pursuant to this article
  with respect to such beverages.




   §  428.  Records  and  reports  of  transportation.  1.  Every  person
  transporting  alcoholic  beverages  within  this  state,  whether   such
  transportation originates within or without this state, when required by
  the commissioner, shall keep a true and accurate record of all alcoholic
  beverages  so  transported,  showing  such  facts  with relation to such
  alcoholic beverages and their transportation  as  the  commissioner  may
  require.  Such record shall be open to inspection by the representatives
  of the department at any time and the commissioner may require from  any
  such  person returns of all or any part of the information shown by such
  records.
    2. The operator of a  motor  vehicle,  as  such  term  is  defined  in
  subdivision  three of section two hundred eighty-two of this chapter, or
  any other means of transport of liquors in which more than ninety liters
  of liquors is being transported in this state must have in  his  or  her
  possession  a  manifest,  invoice or other document which shows the name
  and address of the person from whom such liquors were received  and  the
  date  and  place  of  receipt of such liquor and the name and address of
  every person to whom such operator is to make delivery of the  same  and
  the  place  of  delivery,  together  with  the  number  of  liters to be
  delivered to each person, and, if such liquor is being imported into the
  state in such motor vehicle or such other means of transport,  the  name
  of the distributor importing or causing such liquors to be imported into
  the  state  and  such  other information as the commissioner may require
  pursuant to rule or regulation. Every operator of such motor vehicle  or
  such  other  means of transport shall at the request of a peace officer,
  acting  pursuant  to  his  special  duties,  a   police   officer,   any
  representative  of  the department or any other person authorized by law
  to inquire into or  investigate  the  transportation  of  such  liquors,
  produce  such  manifest,  invoice  or other document for inspection. The
  person causing the operation of such motor vehicle or such  other  means
  of  transport shall be responsible to cause the operator to keep in such
  operator's possession in such motor  vehicle  or  such  other  means  of
  transport  the  manifest,  invoice  or  other  document required by this
  section. The absence of the manifest, invoice or other document required
  by this section shall give rise to a presumption that the liquors  being
  transported  are being imported or caused to be imported into this state
  for sale  or  use  therein  by  other  than  a  registered  distributor.
  Moreover,  the  absence  of  (1) the place of delivery of liquors on the
  manifest, invoice or  other  document  with  respect  to  liquors  being
  imported  into  the  state  shall  give  rise to a presumption that such
  liquors are being imported into the state for sale or use in  the  state
  and (2) the name of a registered distributor on the manifest, invoice or
  other  document  with  respect  to liquors being imported into the state
  shall give rise to a presumption that such liquors are being so imported
  or caused to be imported into this state, for sale or  use  therein,  by
  other  than  a registered distributor. Such presumptions may be rebutted
  by the introduction of substantial evidence to the contrary.




   §  429.  Payment  of tax; returns. 1. Every distributor, noncommercial
  importer or other person shall, on or before the twentieth day  of  each
  month,  file  with  the  department of taxation and finance a return, on
  forms to be  prescribed  by  the  commissioner  and  furnished  by  such
  department,   stating  separately  the  number  of  gallons,  or  lesser
  quantity, of beers, and the number of liters,  or  lesser  quantity,  of
  wines  and  liquors  sold  or  used  by  such distributor, noncommercial
  importer or other person in this state  during  the  preceding  calendar
  month, except that the commissioner may, if he or she deems it necessary
  to  facilitate the efficient reporting and payment of the tax imposed by
  this article, require returns to be made at such times and covering such
  periods as he or she may deem necessary. Such return shall contain  such
  further information as the commissioner shall require. The fact that the
  name  of  the  distributor,  noncommercial  importer  or other person is
  signed to a filed return shall be prima facie evidence for all  purposes
  that  the  return was actually signed by such distributor, noncommercial
  importer or other person.
    2. Each such distributor, noncommercial importer or other person shall
  pay to such department with the filing of such return, the  tax  imposed
  by  this  article,  on  each gallon, or lesser quantity, of beers and on
  each liter, or lesser quantity of all other alcoholic beverages sold  or
  used by such distributor, noncommercial importer or other person in this
  state,  as so reported, during the period covered by such return, except
  that, where a distributor has purchased alcoholic beverages prior to the
  expiration of the period covered by the return,  upon  which  the  taxes
  imposed  by this article have been or are required to be paid by another
  distributor, a credit shall be allowed for the amount of such taxes.
    3. All alcoholic beverages which have come into the  possession  of  a
  distributor  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  sold  or  used  by  such
  distributor unless it shall be proved to the  satisfaction  of  the  tax
  commission that such alcoholic beverages have not been sold or used.
    4.  A distributor entitled to a refund under the provisions of section
  four hundred thirty-four of this chapter, in lieu of  such  refund,  may
  take  credit therefor on a return filed pursuant to this section, unless
  the tax commission shall withdraw such privilege.
    5. The commissioner shall provide any brewer, as such term is  defined
  in  subdivision  five of section three of the alcoholic beverage control
  law, or any distiller, as such term is defined  in  subdivision  ten  of
  section  three of the alcoholic beverage control law, with the option to
  file their tax returns electronically.




   §  430. Determination of tax. If a distributor, noncommercial importer
  or other person files a return under this article, but  such  return  is
  incorrect  or  insufficient,  the  commissioner  of taxation and finance
  shall determine the amount of tax due at any  time  within  three  years
  after  the  return was filed (whether or not such return was filed on or
  after the due date), and give written notice of  such  determination  to
  the  distributor, noncommercial importer or other person, except that if
  such distributor has not registered as  required  by  this  article,  or
  fails  to  file a return or files a willfully false or fraudulent return
  with intent to evade the tax, such determination  may  be  made  at  any
  time.   Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section,
  where, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this section  for
  the  determination of tax, both the commissioner of taxation and finance
  and the taxpayer have consented in writing to  its  determination  after
  such time, the tax may be determined at any time prior to the expiration
  of  the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by
  subsequent agreements in writing  made  before  the  expiration  of  the
  period  previously  agreed upon. Any determination made pursuant to this
  section  shall  finally  and  irrevocably  fix  the   tax   unless   the
  distributor,  noncommercial  importer or other person against whom it is
  assessed shall, within ninety days after the giving of  notice  of  such
  determination,  petition  the  division of tax appeals for a hearing, or
  unless the commissioner of taxation and finance of his own motion, shall
  redetermine the same. After such hearing, the division  of  tax  appeals
  shall  give  notice of the determination of the administrative law judge
  to the distributor, noncommercial importer or other  person  liable  for
  the   tax  and  to  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance.  Such
  determination may be reviewed by the tax appeals tribunal as provided in
  article forty of this chapter. The decision of the tax appeals  tribunal
  may  be  reviewed  as  provided  in section two thousand sixteen of this
  chapter, but the proceeding may not be commenced unless  the  amount  of
  tax  stated  or referred to in the decision, with penalties and interest
  thereon, if any, shall have been first deposited with  the  commissioner
  of  taxation  and  finance,  and  an undertaking filed with him, in such
  amount and with such sureties as a justice of the  supreme  court  shall
  approve,  to  the  effect  that  if  such proceeding be dismissed or the
  decision confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges  which
  may  accrue  against him in the prosecution of the proceeding, or at the
  option of the petitioner such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient  to
  cover  the  tax,  penalties,  interest,  costs and charges aforesaid, in
  which event the petitioner shall  not  be  required  to  pay  such  tax,
  penalties  and  interest  as  a  condition  precedent  to commencing the
  proceeding.
    The remedy provided by this section for review of a  decision  of  the
  tax  appeals  tribunal  shall  be  the exclusive remedy available to any
  taxpayer to judicially determine the  liability  of  such  taxpayer  for
  taxes under this article.




   §  431.  Proceedings  to  recover  tax.  1.  Whenever any distributor,
  noncommercial importer or other person shall fail  to  pay,  within  the
  time  limited  herein,  any  tax  which  he is required to pay under the
  provisions of this article, the attorney-general shall, upon the request
  of the department of taxation and finance, enforce payment of  such  tax
  by  civil  action in the supreme court, in the name of the people of the
  state, against such distributor, noncommercial importer or other  person
  for the amount of such tax, with interest. The procceds of the judgment,
  if any, shall be paid to the department of taxation and finance.
    2.  Whenever  any  distributor, noncommercial importer or other person
  shall fail to pay, within the time limited herein, any tax which  he  is
  required to pay under the provisions of this article, the tax commission
  may  issue a warrant under its official seal, directed to the sheriff of
  any county of the state, commanding him to levy upon and sell  the  real
  and  personal  property  of  such distributor, noncommercial importer or
  other person, found within his county, for the  payment  of  the  amount
  thereof,  with  the  added penalties, interest and the cost of executing
  the warrant, and to return such warrant to the  department  of  taxation
  and  finance  and  to  pay  to  it the money collected by virtue thereof
  within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The  sheriff  shall
  within  five  days after the receipt of the warrant, file with the clerk
  of his county a copy thereof, and thereupon the clerk shall enter in the
  judgment docket the name of the distributor, noncommercial  importer  or
  other  person  mentioned  in  the  warrant,  and  the amount of the tax,
  penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when
  such copy is filed, and thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed
  shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and  personal
  property  of  the  distributor,  noncommercial  importer or other person
  against whom the warrant  is  issued.  Such  lien  shall  not  apply  to
  personal property unless such warrant is also filed in the department of
  state.  The said sheriff shall thereupon proceed upon the warrant in all
  respects, with like effect, and in the same manner prescribed by law  in
  respect  to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court
  of record, and shall be entitled to the same fees for  his  services  in
  executing  the  warrant,  to  be  collected  in  the same manner. In the
  discretion of the tax commission a warrant  of  like  terms,  force  and
  effect  may  be  issued  and  directed to any officer or employee of the
  department of taxation and finance, and in the  execution  thereof  such
  officer  or  employee  shall  have  all the powers conferred by law upon
  sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in  excess  of
  actual  expenses paid in the performance of such duty.  Upon such filing
  of a copy of a warrant, the tax commission shall have the same  remedies
  to  enforce  the  claim  for  taxes,  penalties and interest against the
  distributor, noncommercial importer or other person as if the people  of
  the state had recovered judgment against such distributor, noncommercial
  importer or other person for the amount of the tax.
    3. In addition to the foregoing proceedings, in case of default of any
  distributor  to pay, within the time limited herein, any tax, penalty or
  interest which he is required  to  pay  under  the  provisions  of  this
  article  or  to  file  a bond, other security or a return as required by
  this article or by the tax commission, the tax commission may forward  a
  written  statement  of  the facts showing such default in payment of any
  tax, penalty or interest to the state liquor authority and  may  request
  the  revocation  or  suspension  of  the  license  or  licenses  of such
  distributor on account of such default.




   §  432.  Tax  to  be  paid  but once; foreign and interstate commerce;
  injunction. Nothing in this article shall be construed  to  require  the
  payment  to  the department of taxation and finance of the taxes imposed
  by this article more than once on any quantity  of  alcoholic  beverages
  sold or used within this state. No provision of this article shall apply
  or be construed to apply to foreign or interstate commerce, except in so
  far  as  the  same  may  be  effective  pursuant  to  the  United States
  constitution and to the laws  of  the  United  States  enacted  pursuant
  thereto.  The  supreme  court  shall  have  jurisdiction to restrain the
  department, by injunction, from collecting a tax under this article upon
  any sale as to which, by reason of the United  States  constitution  and
  the  laws  of  the  United  States  enacted pursuant thereto, such a tax
  cannot be imposed.




   §  433.  Penalties  and interest. 1. (a)(i) A distributor who or which
  fails to file a return or to pay any tax within the time required by  or
  pursuant  to  this  article  (determined with regard to any extension of
  time for filing or paying) shall be subject to  a  penalty  of  ten  per
  centum  of  the  amount  of tax determined to be due as provided in this
  article plus one per centum of such amount for each  month  or  fraction
  thereof  during which such failure continues after the expiration of the
  first month after such return was required  to  be  filed  or  such  tax
  became due, not exceeding thirty per centum in the aggregate.
    (ii)  Any  other  person  who fails to file a return or to pay any tax
  within the time required by or pursuant to this article, if such  person
  does  not  offer alcoholic beverages for sale or use alcoholic beverages
  for any commercial purpose, shall be subject to a penalty of  fifty  per
  centum  of  the  amount  of tax determined to be due as provided in this
  article plus one per centum of such amount for each  month  or  fraction
  thereof  during which such failure continues after the expiration of the
  first month after such return was required  to  be  filed  or  such  tax
  become due.
    (iii)  In  the  case  of a failure by a distributor or other person to
  file such return within sixty days of the date prescribed for filing  of
  such  return  by  or pursuant to this article (determined with regard to
  any extension of  time  for  filing),  the  penalties  imposed  by  this
  subdivision  shall not be less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or
  one hundred per centum of the amount required to be shown as tax on such
  return. For the purpose of the preceding sentence,  the  amount  of  tax
  required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any
  part  of  the  tax  which  is  paid on or before the date prescribed for
  payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which
  may be claimed upon the return.
    (b) If any amount of tax is not  paid  on  or  before  the  last  date
  prescribed  in  this article for payment, interest on such amount at the
  underpayment rate set  by  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and  finance
  pursuant  to subdivision twenty-sixth of section one hundred seventy-one
  of this chapter shall be paid for the period from such last date to  the
  date paid, whether or not any extension of time for payment was granted.
  Interest under this paragraph shall not be paid if the amount thereof is
  less than one dollar.
    (c)  If  the  tax  commission  determines that such failure was due to
  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, it shall remit  all  or
  part  of  such  penalties. The tax commission shall promulgate rules and
  regulations as to what constitutes reasonable cause.
    (d) If the failure to pay any tax  within  the  time  required  by  or
  pursuant  to  this article is due to fraud, in lieu of the penalties and
  interest provided for in paragraphs (a) and  (b)  of  this  subdivision,
  there shall be added to the tax (i) a penalty of two times the amount of
  tax  due, plus (ii) interest on such unpaid tax at the underpayment rate
  set by the commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to  subdivision
  twenty-sixth  of section one hundred seventy-one of this chapter for the
  period beginning on the last day prescribed  by  this  article  for  the
  payment  of such tax (determined without regard to any extension of time
  for paying) and ending on the day on which such tax is paid.
    (e) The penalties and interest provided for in this subdivision  shall
  be  determined,  assessed,  collected and paid in the same manner as the
  taxes imposed by this article and shall be disposed  of  as  hereinafter
  provided  with  respect to moneys derived from the tax. Unpaid penalties
  and  interest  under  this  subdivision  may   be   recovered   by   the
  attorney-general  in  an action brought pursuant to section four hundred


 thirty-one of this article. Interest under  this  subdivision  shall  be
  compounded daily.
    2. For purposes of this chapter, the failure to do any act required by
  or under the provisions of this article shall be deemed an act committed
  in  part  at  the  office  of the department of taxation and finance, in
  Albany. For the purposes of this chapter, the  certificate  of  the  tax
  commission to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that a return has
  not  been  filed, or that information has not been supplied, as required
  by or under the  provisions  of  this  article,  shall  be  prima  facie
  evidence  that such tax has not been paid, that such return has not been
  filed, or that such information has not been supplied.
    3. Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see  article  thirty-seven
  of this chapter.




   §  434. Refunds.  1. Whenever the commissioner of taxation and finance
  shall determine that any moneys received under the  provisions  of  this
  article  were  paid in error, he may cause the same to be refunded, with
  interest, in accordance with  such  rules  and  regulations  as  he  may
  prescribe,  except  that  no  interest  shall  be allowed or paid if the
  amount thereof would be less than one dollar. Such interest shall be  at
  the  overpayment  rate  set  by the commissioner pursuant to subdivision
  twenty-sixth of section one hundred seventy-one of this chapter,  or  if
  no rate is set, at the rate of six percent per annum, from the date when
  the tax, penalty or interest to be refunded was paid to a date preceding
  the  date  of  the  refund check by not more than thirty days. Provided,
  however, that for the purposes of this subdivision, any tax paid  before
  the  last  day  prescribed  for its payment shall be deemed to have been
  paid on such last day. Such moneys received under the provisions of this
  article which the commissioner shall determine were paid in  error,  may
  be refunded out of funds in the custody of the comptroller to the credit
  of  such  taxes  provided  an  application  therefor  is  filed with the
  commissioner within two years from the time the  erroneous  payment  was
  made.
    2.  (a)  Whenever (A) any person, other than a distributor hereinafter
  in this paragraph referred to, shall use for non-beverage  purposes  any
  alcoholic  beverages on which taxes are imposed by this article or (B) a
  regularly organized church, synagogue or  religious  organization  shall
  use  for  sacramental purposes wine purchased by it in sealed containers
  at retail, and such alcoholic beverages referred to  in  clause  (A)  or
  wine referred to in clause (B) were not sold to such person or religious
  organization  pursuant  to  a  retailer's  license and have been, to the
  satisfaction of the tax commission, included as taxable in a return made
  by a  distributor,  such  person  or  religious  organization  shall  be
  reimbursed  the amount of the taxes thereon in the manner and subject to
  the conditions hereinafter specified. Whenever any distributor shall use
  for non-beverage  purposes  any  alcoholic  beverages  on  which  he  is
  required  to  pay  the taxes imposed by this article, the tax commission
  may permit such  distributor  to  report  such  alcoholic  beverages  as
  nontaxable.
    (b) Any person holding a license issued by the state liquor authority,
  who,  pursuant to such license, shall sell any alcoholic beverages, upon
  which  taxes  imposed  by  this  article  have  been  paid,  under  such
  circumstances  that  the  state would be without power to impose the tax
  under this article, or for resale under like circumstances,  may  secure
  reimbursement  for  the  amount  of  the taxes so paid in the manner and
  subject to the conditions specified in this subdivision, but in  a  case
  specified  in this paragraph no refund shall be made under paragraph (a)
  of this subdivision.
    (c) All claims for reimbursement under this subdivision must be  filed
  within  two  years  from the time of the nontaxable sale or use.  Claims
  shall be made, in such form and containing such information as  the  tax
  commission   shall   prescribe.  Claims  for  reimbursement  under  this
  subdivision, approved by the tax commission, shall be paid  out  of  the
  funds deposited to the credit of the comptroller on account of the taxes
  imposed by this article.
    3. If an agreement under the provisions of section four hundred thirty
  (extending  the period for determination of tax imposed by this article)
  is made within the two-year  period  for  the  filing  of  a  claim  for
  reimbursement or an application for refund provided for in this section,
  the  period  for  filing a claim for reimbursement or an application for
  refund shall not expire prior to six months after the expiration of  the


 period  within  which  a  determination  may  be  made  pursuant  to the
  agreement or any extension thereof.




   §  434-a. Mailing rules; holidays. 1. If any return, claim, statement,
  notice, application, or other document required  to  be  filed,  or  any
  payment  required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before
  a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this  article  is,
  after  such  period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the
  tax commission, bureau, office, officer or person  with  which  or  with
  whom  such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such
  payment is required to be made, the date of the United  States  postmark
  stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This
  subdivision  shall  apply  only  if  the  postmark date falls within the
  prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing  of
  such  document,  or  for  making  the  payment,  including any extension
  granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment
  was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly  addressed  to  the
  tax  commission,  bureau,  office,  officer or person with which or with
  whom the document is required to be filed or to which or  to  whom  such
  payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States
  registered  mail,  such  registration shall be prima facie evidence that
  such document was delivered  to  the  tax  commission,  bureau,  office,
  officer  or person to which or to whom addressed. To the extent that the
  tax commission shall prescribe by regulation, certified mail may be used
  in lieu of registered mail under this section.  This  subdivision  shall
  apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States Post Office
  only if and to the extent provided by regulations of the tax commission.
    2.  Any  notice authorized or required under this article may be given
  by mailing it to the person for whom  it  is  intended,  in  a  postpaid
  envelope  addressed  to  such  person at the address given by him in his
  application for registration as a distributor  or  in  the  last  return
  filed by him under this article or, if no application or return has been
  filed,  then  to  such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such
  notice shall be presumptive evidence of its receipt  by  the  person  to
  whom  addressed.    Any period of time, which is determined according to
  the provisions of this article, for the giving of notice shall  commence
  to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
    3.  When  the  last  day  prescribed  under  authority of this article
  (including any extension of  time)  for  performing  any  act  falls  on
  Saturday,  Sunday  or  a  legal  holiday  in  the state of New York, the
  performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on
  the next succeeding day which is not  a  Saturday,  Sunday  or  a  legal
  holiday.
    4.(a)  Any  reference in subdivision one of this section to the United
  States mail shall be treated as including a reference  to  any  delivery
  service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States
  pursuant  to  section  seventy-five  hundred two of the internal revenue
  code and any reference in subdivision one of this section to a  postmark
  by  the  United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to
  any  date  recorded  or  marked  in  the  manner  described  in  section
  seventy-five  hundred  two  of the internal revenue code by a designated
  delivery service. If the commissioner finds that  any  delivery  service
  designated  by  such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the state,
  the commissioner may withdraw such  designation  for  purposes  of  this
  article.   The  commissioner  may  also  designate  additional  delivery
  services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the
  internal revenue code for purposes of this article, or may withdraw  any
  such  designation  if  the commissioner finds that a delivery service so
  designated is inadequate for the needs of the state.  Any  reference  in
  subdivision  one  of  this  section  to  the United States mail shall be
  treated as including a reference to any delivery service  designated  by


 the commissioner and any reference in subdivision one of this section to
  a  postmark  by  the  United States mail shall be treated as including a
  reference to any date recorded or marked  in  the  manner  described  in
  section  seventy-five  hundred  two  of  the  internal revenue code by a
  delivery service designated by the commissioner.
    (b) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated  by  the
  United  States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the
  commissioner pursuant to the same criteria used by  such  secretary  for
  such  designations  pursuant  to section seventy-five hundred two of the
  internal  revenue  code,  shall  be  included  within  the  meaning   of
  registered or certified mail as used in subdivision one of this section.
  If the commissioner finds that any equivalent of registered or certified
  mail  is  inadequate  for  the  needs of the state, the commissioner may
  withdraw such designation for purposes of this article.




   §  435.  Deposit  and  disposition of revenue. All taxes, interest and
  penalties collected or received by the tax commission  under  the  taxes
  imposed  by  this article shall be deposited and disposed of pursuant to
  the provisions of section one hundred seventy-one-a of this chapter.




   § 436. General powers of the tax commission. The powers conferred upon
  the  tax  commission by sections one hundred seventy-one and one hundred
  seventy-one-b  of  this  chapter  shall,  so  far  as   applicable,   be
  exercisable with respect to the provisions of this article.




   §  437.  Returns  to  be  secret.  1. Except in accordance with proper
  judicial order or as in this section or otherwise provided  by  law,  it
  shall  be  unlawful  for  the  tax commission, any tax commissioner, any
  officer or employee of the department of taxation and  finance,  or  any
  officer or person who, pursuant to this section, is permitted to inspect
  any  return or report or to whom a copy, an abstract or a portion of any
  return or report is furnished, or to whom any information  contained  in
  any  return or report is furnished, or any person engaged or retained by
  such department on an independent contract basis, or any person  who  in
  any  manner  may acquire knowledge of the contents of a return or report
  filed pursuant to this article to divulge or make known  in  any  manner
  the  contents  or  any  other  information relating to the business of a
  distributor, owner or other person contained in  any  return  or  report
  required  under  this  article. The officers charged with the custody of
  such returns or reports shall not be required to produce any of them  or
  evidence  of  anything  contained in them in any action or proceeding in
  any court, except on behalf of the state, the  state  liquor  authority,
  any county alcoholic beverage control board, the New York city alcoholic
  beverage  control board or the tax commission in an action or proceeding
  under  the  provisions  of  this  chapter  or  chapter  three-b  of  the
  consolidated  laws,  or  on behalf of the state or the tax commission in
  any other action or proceeding involving the collection  of  a  tax  due
  under  this  chapter to which the state or the tax commission is a party
  or a claimant or on behalf of any party  to  any  action  or  proceeding
  under  the  provisions  of  this  article  or  chapter  three-b  of  the
  consolidated laws, when the returns or the reports or  the  facts  shown
  thereby  are  directly  involved  in such action or proceeding, or in an
  action or proceeding relating to the regulation or taxation of alcoholic
  beverages on behalf of officers to  whom  information  shall  have  been
  supplied as provided in subdivision two of this section, in any of which
  events  the  court  may  require  the  production  of,  and may admit in
  evidence so much of said returns  or  reports  or  of  the  facts  shown
  thereby  as  are  pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. The
  tax commission may, nevertheless, publish a copy or  a  summary  of  any
  decision  rendered after the formal hearing provided for in section four
  hundred thirty of this chapter. Nothing herein  shall  be  construed  to
  prohibit  the  tax  commission,  in  its  discretion,  from allowing the
  inspection or delivery of a certified copy of any return or report filed
  under this article or of any information contained in any such return or
  report by or to a duly authorized  officer  or  employee  of  the  state
  liquor  authority  or  of  the  New York city alcoholic beverage control
  board or of any county alcoholic beverage control board; or by or to the
  attorney-general or other legal representatives of  the  state  when  an
  action shall have been recommended or commenced pursuant to this chapter
  or  chapter  three-b  of  the consolidated laws in which such returns or
  reports or the  facts  shown  thereby  are  directly  involved;  or  the
  inspection  of the returns or reports required under this article by the
  comptroller  or  duly  designated  officer  or  employee  of  the  state
  department  of  audit and control, for purposes of the audit of a refund
  of any tax paid by a distributor or other person under this article; nor
  to prohibit the delivery to a distributor, owner or other person,  or  a
  duly  authorized  representative  of  such  distributor,  owner or other
  person of a certified copy  of  any  return  or  report  filed  by  such
  distributor,  owner  or  other  person  pursuant to this article, nor to
  prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to  prevent  the
  identification  of  particular returns or reports and the items thereof.
  Returns and reports shall be preserved for three  years  and  thereafter
  until the tax commission orders them to be destroyed.


   2.  The  tax  commission, in its discretion and pursuant to such rules
  and regulations as it may adopt, may permit the commissioner of internal
  revenue of the United States, or the appropriate officers of  any  other
  state  which  regulates  or  taxes  alcoholic  beverages,  or  the  duly
  authorized representatives of such commissioner or of any such officers,
  to  inspect  returns  or  reports  made pursuant to this article, or may
  furnish to such commissioner  or  other  officers,  or  duly  authorized
  representatives,  a  copy of any such return or report or an abstract of
  the information therein contained, or any portion thereof, or may supply
  such commissioner or any such  officers  or  such  representatives  with
  information  relating  to  the business of a distributor, owner or other
  person making returns or  reports  hereunder.  The  tax  commission  may
  refuse  to  supply  information  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  to the
  commissioner of internal revenue of the United States or to the officers
  of any other state if the statutes of the United States, or of the state
  represented  by  such  officers,  do  not  grant  substantially  similar

   §  438.  Sale  of  stamps  authorized.  1.  Notwithstanding  any other
  provision of this article, the tax commission may by regulation  provide
  that  the  taxes  on  alcoholic beverages shall be collected through the
  sale of stamps, to be prepared and sold by it. The tax commission  shall
  have power to determine the form and denominations of such stamps and to
  prescribe by regulation the manner and time of affixation of such stamps
  to  containers  of  alcoholic  beverages. It may provide for the sale of
  such stamps by duly authorized agents, but such stamps shall not be sold
  by any person not so authorized. The penalties and interest for  failure
  to  affix stamps, in case the same are prescribed by the tax commission,
  shall be the same as the penalties and interest in this article provided
  for failure to pay taxes. If stamps are  so  prescribed,  any  alcoholic
  beverages in containers to which stamps are required to be affixed shall
  be  subject to confiscation by any duly authorized representative of the
  tax commission, any  peace  officer,  acting  pursuant  to  his  special
  duties,  or  any  police  officer in case the stamps are not so affixed.
  Alcoholic beverages so confiscated may be sold by the tax commission  to
  any  person  holding  a  proper  license  granted  by  the  state liquor
  authority, and the proceeds of any such sale  shall  be  paid  into  the
  treasury of the state.
    2.  In  the  event that stamps are prescribed all of the provisions of
  this article shall apply,  so  far  as  they  may  be  or  can  be  made
  applicable.




   §  445.  Local  taxes  on  beer and liquor by a city of one million or
  more.  1. Any city in this state having a population of one  million  or
  more,  acting  through  its local legislative body, is hereby authorized
  and empowered to adopt and amend local laws imposing in  any  such  city
  excise  taxes  on  a  distributor  and  a  noncommercial importer at the
  following rates:
    (a) Twelve cents per gallon upon beers and
    (b)  Twenty-six  and  four-tenths  cents  per  liter  on  the  liquors
  described  in  paragraph  (f) of subdivision one of section four hundred
  twenty-four, when sold or used in such city.
    Such local law shall provide that if prior to the date upon which  the
  taxes  go into effect, a contract of sale of any beer or other alcoholic
  beverages described above was made, and  delivery  thereof  pursuant  to
  such  contract  is  made within the city imposing such taxes on or after
  the effective date thereof, the vendor shall be  deemed  a  distributor,
  and  such beer and other alcoholic beverages shall be deemed to be sold,
  and shall be subject to the tax at the time of such delivery.
    2. Every local  law  imposing  taxes  pursuant  to  the  authority  of
  subdivision  one  shall  also  impose  upon  each  person,  other than a
  distributor within the meaning of such local law, who, on the  date  the
  taxes  imposed  pursuant  to  the  authority  of such subdivision become
  effective, owns and possesses for the purposes of sale  beer,  or  other
  alcoholic  beverages  described  in  subdivision one, a floor tax at the
  rates applicable under subdivision one upon such beer in excess  of  one
  hundred  gallons  and  upon  such other alcoholic beverages in excess of
  four hundred liters. Such floor tax shall be  due  and  payable  on  the
  twentieth  day  of  the  month  succeeding  the month in which the taxes
  become effective.
    3. All the provisions  of  this  article  shall  apply  to  the  taxes
  authorized  by  subdivision  one  of  this section and the provisions of
  section four hundred  twenty,  four  hundred  twenty-six,  four  hundred
  twenty-nine  through  four  hundred thirty-four, four hundred thirty-six
  and four hundred thirty-seven shall  apply  to  the  tax  authorized  by
  subdivision  two thereof, so far as such article or sections can be made
  applicable to the taxes authorized by this section with such limitations
  as set forth in this section and such modifications as may be  necessary
  in  order  to  adapt such language to the local taxes authorized by this
  section. Provided, however, in every case where the words  "this  state"
  appear in subdivision four of section four hundred twenty-four exempting
  quantities of liquor from tax, and in the definition of "Distributor" or
  "Noncommercial  importer"  in  section  four  hundred  twenty and in the
  provisions relating to the registration of distributors in section  four
  hundred  twenty-one  of  this  article and in the provisions relating to
  presumption of taxability in section four hundred twenty-five-a of  this
  article,  such  words  "this  state"  shall  be  read as "this city" for
  purposes of the taxes authorized by this section. Where the word "state"
  is used in a phrase referring to the sale or use of alcoholic  beverages
  in this state, such word "state" shall be read as "city" for purposes of
  the  taxes authorized by this section, unless the word "city" clearly is
  not applicable.
    4. Any taxes imposed pursuant to the authority of this  section  shall
  be  administered  and collected by the tax commission in the same manner
  as the taxes imposed under sections four hundred  twenty-four  and  four
  hundred  twenty-five subject to all provisions of this article as may be
  applicable. The state tax commission is hereby empowered  to  make  such
  provisions  as  it  deems  necessary  for  the  joint administration and
  collection of the state and local taxes imposed and authorized  by  this
  article.  Nothing  in  this article which requires payment of both state


 and local taxes to the tax commission shall be construed as the  payment
  of either tax more than once.
    5.  A  local  law  imposing  taxes  pursuant  to the authority of this
  section or repealing or suspending such taxes must go into  effect  only
  on  the  first  day  of  a  calendar  month.  No such local law shall be
  effective unless a certified copy of such law is  mailed  by  registered
  mail  to the state tax commission at its office in Albany at least sixty
  days prior to the date it is  to  become  effective.  However,  the  tax
  commission,  by  resolution, may waive and reduce such sixty day minimum
  notice requirement to a mailing of such  certified  copy  by  registered
  mail  within  a  period  of  not  less  than  thirty  days prior to such
  effective date if it deems such action to be consistent with its  duties
  under this section.
    6.  Certified  copies of any local law described in this section shall
  also be filed with the city clerk, the secretary of state and the  state
  comptroller within five days after the date it is enacted.
    7.  All  taxes,  penalties  and  interest  imposed by a city under the
  authority of  this  section,  which  are  collected  by  the  state  tax
  commission,  shall  be  deposited  daily  with  such  responsible banks,
  banking houses or trust companies, as may be  designated  by  the  state
  comptroller,  to  the  credit of the comptroller, in trust for such city
  imposing the tax. Such deposits shall be kept in trust and separate  and
  apart  from  all  other monies in the possession of the comptroller. The
  comptroller shall require adequate security from all  such  depositories
  of  such  revenue collected by the tax commission. The comptroller shall
  retain in his hands such amount as  the  commissioner  of  taxation  and
  finance  may  determine  to  be  necessary for refunds in respect of the
  taxes imposed under the authority of this section,  and  for  reasonable
  costs  of  the  state  tax  commission  in administering, collecting and
  distributing such taxes, out of which  the  comptroller  shall  pay  any
  refunds  of  such  taxes  to which taxpayers shall be entitled under the
  provisions of this article. The comptroller, after reserving such refund
  fund and such costs shall, on or before the twelfth day of  each  month,
  pay to the appropriate fiscal officer of such city, the taxes, penalties
  and  interest  imposed by such city under the authority of this section,
  collected by the state tax commission pursuant to  this  article  during
  the  next  preceding  calendar  month.  The  amount  so payable shall be
  certified  to  the  comptroller  by  the  president  of  the  state  tax
  commission  or  his  delegate,  who  shall  not  be  held liable for any
  inaccuracy in such certificate. Where the amount so paid  over  to  such
  city  in  any such distribution is more or less than the amount then due
  to such city, the amount of the overpayment  or  underpayment  shall  be
  certified  to  the  comptroller  by  the  president  of  the  state  tax
  commission or his delegate,  who  shall  not  be  held  liable  for  any
  inaccuracy  in  such  certificate.  The  amount  of  the  overpayment or
  underpayment shall be so certified to the comptroller as soon after  the
  discovery  of the overpayment or underpayment as reasonably possible and
  subsequent payments and distributions by the comptroller  to  such  city
  shall be adjusted by subtracting the amount of any such overpayment from
  or  by  adding  the  amount  of  any such underpayment to such number of
  subsequent  payments  and  distributions  as  the  comptroller  and  the
  president  of the state tax commission shall consider reasonable in view
  of the amount of the overpayment or underpayment and all other facts  or
  circumstances.

    17. "Reservation cigarette seller." A seller of cigarettes which is an
  Indian  nation or tribe, one or more members of such tribe, or an entity
  wholly owned by either  or  both,  which  sells  cigarettes  within  the
  boundaries of a qualified reservation.

    19. "Cigar." Any roll of tobacco wrapped in leaf  tobacco  or  in  any
  substance  containing  tobacco (other than any roll of tobacco that is a
  cigarette as defined in subdivision one of this section). "Cigar"  shall
  include, except where expressly excluded, any little cigar.
    20. "Research tobacco product." A tobacco product or cigarette that is
  labeled  as a research tobacco product, manufactured for use in research

   §  471.  Imposition  of cigarette tax.  1. There is hereby imposed and
  shall be paid a tax on all cigarettes possessed  in  the  state  by  any
  person  for sale, except that no tax shall be imposed on cigarettes sold
  under such circumstances that this state is without power to impose such
  tax, including  sales  to  qualified  Indians  for  their  own  use  and
  consumption  on their nations' or tribes' qualified reservation, or sold
  to the United States  or  sold  to  or  by  a  voluntary  unincorporated
  organization  of the armed forces of the United States operating a place
  for the sale  of  goods  pursuant  to  regulations  promulgated  by  the
  appropriate  executive  agency  of  the  United  States,  to  the extent
  provided in such regulations and policy statements  of  such  an  agency
  applicable  to such sales. The tax imposed by this section is imposed on
  all cigarettes sold on an  Indian  reservation  to  non-members  of  the
  Indian nation or tribe and to non-Indians and evidence of such tax shall
  be  by means of an affixed cigarette tax stamp. Indian nations or tribes
  may elect to participate in  the  Indian  tax  exemption  coupon  system
  established  in section four hundred seventy-one-e of this article which
  provides a mechanism for the collection  of  the  tax  imposed  by  this
  section on cigarette sales on qualified reservations to such non-members
  and  non-Indians  and  for  the  delivery  of  quantities  of tax-exempt
  cigarettes to  Indian  nations  or  tribes  for  the  personal  use  and
  consumption  of  qualified  members of the Indian nation or tribe. If an
  Indian nation or tribe does not elect to participate in the  Indian  tax
  exemption  coupon  system,  the  prior  approval  system  shall  be  the
  mechanism for the delivery of quantities  of  tax-exempt  cigarettes  to
  Indian  nations  or  tribes  for  the  personal  use  and consumption of
  qualified members of the Indian nation  or  tribe  as  provided  for  in
  paragraph  (b)  of  subdivision  five  of  this  section.  Such  tax  on
  cigarettes shall be at the rate of five dollars  and  thirty-five  cents
  for  each twenty cigarettes or fraction thereof, provided, however, that
  if a package of cigarettes contains more  than  twenty  cigarettes,  the
  rate  of tax on the cigarettes in such package in excess of twenty shall
  be one dollar and thirty-three and three-quarters cents  for  each  five
  cigarettes  or fraction thereof. Such tax is intended to be imposed upon
  only one sale of the same package of cigarettes. It  shall  be  presumed
  that  all  cigarettes  within  the  state  are  subject to tax until the
  contrary is established, and the burden of proof that any cigarettes are
  not taxable hereunder shall be upon the person in possession thereof.
    2. It is intended that the ultimate incidence of and liability for the
  tax shall be upon the consumer, and that any agent or dealer  who  shall
  pay the tax to the commissioner shall collect the tax from the purchaser
  or  consumer.  Except as hereinafter provided, the tax shall be advanced
  and paid by the agent. The agent shall be liable for the collection  and
  payment  of  the tax on cigarettes imposed by this article and shall pay
  the tax to the commissioner by purchasing, under such regulations as  he
  or   she   shall   prescribe,   adhesive  stamps  of  such  designs  and
  denominations as he or she shall prescribe. The tax  on  cigarettes  may
  also  be  paid  by  or  through  the  use  of  metering  machines if the
  commissioner so prescribes. Agents, located within or without the state,
  shall purchase stamps and affix such stamps in the manner prescribed  to
  packages  of  cigarettes  to be sold within the state, in which case any
  dealer subsequently receiving such stamped packages of  cigarettes  will
  not  be  required  to  purchase  and  affix  stamps  on such packages of
  cigarettes. All cigarettes sold by  agents  and  wholesalers  to  Indian
  nations  or tribes or reservation cigarette sellers located on an Indian
  reservation must bear a tax stamp.


   3. The amount of taxes advanced and paid by the agent  as  hereinabove
  provided  shall  be added to and collected as part of the sales price of
  the cigarettes.
    4.  (a)  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  law  to the contrary, no
  person, including but not limited to  a  tobacco  product  manufacturer,
  shall sell unstamped packages of cigarettes to any agent, if such person
  has  not  been provided with a certification by the agent as required in
  paragraph (b) of this subdivision.
    (b) Any agent who purchases unstamped packages of cigarettes from  any
  person,  which  are  intended  for  resale  in  or into the state, shall
  provide such person  and  the  department  with  a  certification  under
  penalty  of perjury that such cigarettes will not be resold by the agent
  in violation of the terms of this article. Such certification  shall  be
  provided  to  such  person and the department prior to the first sale of
  such cigarettes by such person to the agent following the effective date
  of this subdivision, and annually thereafter, on such form as  shall  be
  prescribed by the commissioner.
    5.  Prior  approval  system.  (a)  For  any  year  that the recognized
  governing body  of  an  Indian  nation  or  tribe  has  not  elected  to
  participate  in  the  Indian  tax exemption coupon system established in
  section four hundred seventy-one-e of this  article,  paragraph  (b)  of
  this  subdivision  provides  for  the  prior  approval  system to be the
  mechanism as to how Indian nations or tribes  or  reservation  cigarette
  sellers  can  purchase  adequate quantities of tax-exempt cigarettes for
  the personal use and consumption of  qualified  members  of  the  Indian
  nation or tribe on their nations' or tribes' qualified reservation.
    (b)  If an Indian nation or tribe does not elect to participate in the
  Indian  tax  exemption  coupon  system,  Indian  nations  or  tribes  or
  reservation  cigarette sellers may purchase from New York state licensed
  cigarette stamping  agents  and  wholesalers  an  adequate  quantity  of
  tax-exempt  cigarettes  based  on  probable  demand on their nations' or
  tribes' qualified reservation for official nation or tribal or qualified
  Indian use or consumption from agents and wholesalers who have  received
  prior  approval  from  the  department. All such pre-approved tax exempt
  cigarettes shall nonetheless bear a  tax  stamp.  The  department  shall
  grant  agents  and wholesalers prior approval in a manner and form to be
  determined by the department and as may be prescribed by regulation. The
  department shall issue expedited refunds or credits to  agents  whenever
  the  department  grants  such  prior approvals. Probable demand shall be
  determined as provided  by  subdivision  two  of  section  four  hundred
  seventy-one-e of this article and as may be prescribed by regulation.
    6.  Tax  agreements with Indian nations or tribes. If an Indian nation
  or tribe enters into an agreement with the  state  and  the  legislature
  approves  such  agreement or if an Indian nation or tribe enters into an
  agreement with the state  that  is  part  of  a  stipulation  and  order
  approved by a federal court of competent jurisdiction regarding the sale
  and  distribution  of  cigarettes  on  the nation's or tribe's qualified
  reservation, the terms of such agreement shall take precedence over  the
  provisions  of this article and exempt sales to non-members of the tribe
  or nation and non-Indians by such nation from such taxes to  the  extent
  that  such  taxes are specifically referred to in the agreement, and the
  sale or distribution, including transportation, of any cigarettes to the
  nation's or tribe's qualified reservation shall be  in  accordance  with
  the provisions of such agreement.
    7.  The  taxes imposed under this section shall not apply to adult-use
  cannabis products subject to tax under article twenty-C of this chapter.




   §  471-a.  Use tax on cigarettes. There is hereby imposed and shall be
  paid a tax on all cigarettes used in the state  by  any  person,  except
  that  no  tax  shall  be imposed (1) if the tax provided in section four
  hundred seventy-one  of  this  article  is  paid,  (2)  on  the  use  of
  cigarettes which are exempt from the tax imposed by said section, or (3)
  on  the  use  of four hundred or less cigarettes, brought into the state
  on, or in the possession of, any person. Such tax on cigarettes shall be
  at the rate of five  dollars  and  thirty-five  cents  for  each  twenty
  cigarettes  or fraction thereof, provided, however, that if a package of
  cigarettes contains more than twenty cigarettes, the rate of tax on  the
  cigarettes  in  such package in excess of twenty shall be one dollar and
  thirty-three and  three-quarters  cents  for  each  five  cigarettes  or
  fraction  thereof.  Within twenty-four hours after liability for the tax
  accrues, each such person shall file with the commissioner a  return  in
  such  form  as the commissioner may prescribe together with a remittance
  of the tax shown to be due thereon. For purposes of  this  article,  the
  word  "use"  means  the  exercise  of  any  right  or  power  actual  or
  constructive and shall include  but  is  not  limited  to  the  receipt,
  storage  or  any  keeping or retention for any length of time, but shall
  not include possession for sale. All other provisions of this article if
  not inconsistent shall apply to the administration  and  enforcement  of
  the tax imposed by this section in the same manner as if the language of
  said provisions had been incorporated in full into this section.




   §  471-b.  Imposition  of  tobacco  products  tax.  1. There is hereby
  imposed and shall be paid a tax on all  tobacco  products  possessed  in
  this  state  by any person for sale, except that no tax shall be imposed
  on tobacco products sold under such circumstances  that  this  state  is
  without  power to impose such tax, or sold to the United States, or sold
  to or by a voluntary unincorporated organization of the armed forces  of
  the  United  States  operating a place for the sale of goods pursuant to
  regulations promulgated by  the  appropriate  executive  agency  of  the
  United  States,  to  the  extent provided in such regulations and policy
  statements of such an agency applicable to such sales.
    (a) Such tax on tobacco products other than snuff  and  little  cigars
  shall be at the rate of seventy-five percent of the wholesale price, and
  is  intended  to  be  imposed  only  once  upon  the sale of any tobacco
  products other than snuff and little cigars.
    (b) Such tax on snuff shall be at the rate of two  dollars  per  ounce
  and  a  proportionate rate on any fractional parts of an ounce, provided
  that cans or packages of snuff with a net weight of less than one  ounce
  shall  be  taxed at the equivalent rate of cans or packages weighing one
  ounce. Such tax shall be computed based on the net weight as  listed  by
  the  manufacturer, and is intended to be imposed only once upon the sale
  of any snuff.
    (c) Such tax on little cigars shall be at the  same  rate  imposed  on
  cigarettes  under  this  article and is intended to be imposed only once
  upon the sale of any little cigars.
    It shall be presumed that all tobacco products within  the  state  are
  subject  to  tax  until  the  contrary is established, and the burden of
  proof that any tobacco products are not taxable hereunder shall be  upon
  the person in possession thereof.
    2.  The  distributor  shall  be  liable  for the payment of the tax on
  tobacco products which he imports or causes  to  be  imported  into  the
  state,  or  which  he  manufactures  in the state, and every distributor
  authorized by the commissioner of taxation and finance to  make  returns
  and pay the tax on tobacco products sold, shipped or delivered by him to
  any  person  in  the state shall be liable for the payment of the tax on
  all tobacco products so sold, shipped or delivered.
    3. Every dealer shall be liable for the tax on all tobacco products in
  his possession at any time, upon which tax has not been paid or  assumed
  by  a distributor appointed by the commissioner of taxation and finance,
  and the failure of any dealer to produce and exhibit to the commissioner
  of taxation and finance or his authorized representative upon demand, an
  invoice by a distributor or licensed wholesale dealer  for  any  tobacco
  products  in  his  possession shall be presumptive evidence that the tax
  thereon has not been paid, and that such dealer is liable  for  the  tax
  thereon  unless  evidence  of  such invoice, payment or assumption shall
  later be produced.




   §  471-c. Use tax on tobacco products. (a) There is hereby imposed and
  shall be paid a tax on all tobacco products used in  the  state  by  any
  person, except that no such tax shall be imposed (1) if the tax provided
  in section four hundred seventy-one-b of this article is paid, or (2) on
  the  use  of  tobacco  products which are exempt from the tax imposed by
  said section, or (3) on the use of two hundred fifty cigars or less,  or
  five  pounds  or  less  of  tobacco other than roll-your-own tobacco, or
  thirty-six ounces or less of  roll-your-own  tobacco  brought  into  the
  state on, or in the possession of, any person.
    (i)  Such  tax  on tobacco products other than snuff and little cigars
  shall be at the rate of seventy-five percent of the wholesale price.
    (ii) Such tax on snuff shall be at the rate of two dollars  per  ounce
  and  a  proportionate rate on any fractional parts of an ounce, provided
  that cans or packages of snuff with a net weight of less than one  ounce
  shall  be  taxed at the equivalent rate of cans or packages weighing one
  ounce. Such tax shall be computed based on the net weight as  listed  by
  the manufacturer.
    (iii)  Such  tax on little cigars shall be at the same rate imposed on
  cigarettes under this article and is intended to be  imposed  only  once
  upon the sale of any little cigars.
    (b) Within twenty-four hours after liability for the tax accrues, each
  such  person  shall  file with the commissioner a return in such form as
  the commissioner may prescribe together with a  remittance  of  the  tax
  shown  to  be  due thereon. For purposes of this article, the word "use"
  means the exercise of any right or  power  actual  or  constructive  and
  shall  include but is not limited to the receipt, storage or any keeping
  or retention for any length of time, but shall  not  include  possession
  for sale. All the other provisions of this article, if not inconsistent,
  shall  apply to the administration and enforcement of the tax imposed by
  this section in the same manner as if the language  of  said  provisions
  had been incorporated in full into this section.




   §  471-d.  Special  provision  as  to  imposition  of taxes on certain
  tobacco products. If a person shall receive any tobacco  products,  upon
  which  tobacco products this state was without power to impose the taxes
  under this article,  and  such  person  shall  thereafter  possess  such
  tobacco  products  for  sale  or  use  any such tobacco products in such
  manner and under such circumstances as  may  subject  the  same  to  the
  taxing  power  of this state with respect to such possession for sale or
  use, such person shall be liable for the tax  imposed  by  section  four
  hundred  seventy-one-b or four hundred seventy-one-c of this article, as
  the case may be with respect to such sale or use,  and  shall  make  the
  same reports and returns, pay the same taxes and be subject to all other
  provisions  of this article relating to distributors, except that such a
  person shall not be subject to the provisions of sections  four  hundred
  seventy-two  and four hundred eighty of this article if such person does
  not offer tobacco products for sale.




   §  471-e.  Taxes  imposed  on  qualified  reservations.  1. Indian tax
  exemption coupon system.  (a)  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of  this
  article  to  the  contrary qualified Indians may purchase cigarettes for
  such qualified Indians' own use or consumption exempt from cigarette tax
  on their nations'  or  tribes'  qualified  reservations.  However,  such
  qualified  Indians  purchasing  cigarettes  off their reservations or on
  another  nation's  or  tribe's  reservation,  and   non-Indians   making
  cigarette  purchases  on  an Indian reservation shall not be exempt from
  paying the cigarette tax when purchasing cigarettes within  this  state.
  Accordingly, all cigarettes sold on an Indian reservation to non-members
  of the nation or tribe or to non-Indians shall be taxed, and evidence of
  such tax will be by means of an affixed cigarette tax stamp.
    (b)  In  order  to ensure an adequate quantity of cigarettes on Indian
  reservations which may be purchased by qualified Indians exempt from the
  cigarette tax, the recognized governing body  of  an  Indian  nation  or
  tribe  may  annually  elect  to  participate in the Indian tax exemption
  coupon system for that year. If the  recognized  governing  body  of  an
  Indian  nation  or  tribe  elects  within  the  time  specified  by  the
  department to participate in the Indian tax exemption coupon system  for
  that  year, the department shall provide the Indian nation or tribe with
  Indian tax exemption coupons as  set  forth  in  this  section.  If  the
  recognized governing body of an Indian nation or tribe does not elect to
  participate  in  the Indian tax exemption coupon system for that year or
  does not make this election for that year within the time  specified  by
  the department, no Indian tax exemption coupons will be provided to that
  Indian  nation or tribe for that year. Instead, for that year, the prior
  approval system set forth  in  paragraph  (b)  of  subdivision  five  of
  section four hundred seventy-one of this article shall be used. When the
  recognized governing body of an Indian nation or tribe elects to use the
  Indian tax exemption coupon system for a year, an Indian nation or tribe
  and  a reservation cigarette seller shall be able to present such Indian
  tax exemption coupons to a wholesale dealer licensed  pursuant  to  this
  article  in  order  to  purchase  stamped  cigarettes  exempt  from  the
  imposition  of  the  cigarette  tax.  Qualified  Indians  may   purchase
  cigarettes from a reservation cigarette seller exempt from the cigarette
  tax  even  though  such  cigarettes  will  have an affixed cigarette tax
  stamp.
    2. Indian tax exemption coupons. (a) If the recognized governing  body
  of  an Indian nation or tribe timely elects to participate in the Indian
  tax exemption coupon system for that year, Indian tax exemption  coupons
  shall be provided to the recognized governing body of such Indian nation
  or  tribe  to  ensure  that  such  Indian  nation  or  tribe  can obtain
  cigarettes upon which the tax will not be collected that are for the use
  or consumption by the nation or tribe or by the members of  such  nation
  or  tribe.  The  Indian  tax exemption coupons shall be provided to such
  Indian nations or tribes on a quarterly  basis  for  each  of  the  four
  quarters  beginning  with  the  first  day of December, March, June, and
  September of that year. It is intended that the Indian nations or tribes
  will retain the amount of Indian tax exemption coupons  they  will  need
  each  quarter  to purchase cigarettes for official nation or tribal use,
  and will distribute  the  remaining  Indian  tax  exemption  coupons  to
  reservation  cigarette  sellers  on  such  nations' or tribes' qualified
  reservations. Only Indian nations or  tribes  or  reservation  cigarette
  sellers  on  their  qualified  reservations  may  redeem such Indian tax
  exemption coupons pursuant to this section.
    (b) The amount of Indian tax exemption coupons  to  be  given  to  the
  recognized  governing body of each Indian nation or tribe shall be based
  upon the probable demand of the qualified Indians on  such  nation's  or


 tribe's qualified reservation plus the amount needed for official nation
  or tribal use.
    (i)  Probable  demand shall be determined by reference to, among other
  data, the United States average cigarette  consumption  per  capita,  as
  compiled  for  the  most  recently  completed  calendar  or fiscal year,
  multiplied by the number of qualified Indians  for  each  such  affected
  Indian nation or tribe.
    (ii)  In  making  a  determination  of probable demand, the department
  shall take into consideration any evidence submitted by such  recognized
  governing  body  relating  to  such  probable demand (e.g., a verifiable
  record of previous sales  to  qualified  Indians  or  other  statistical
  evidence)  and/or  relating  to  the  amount needed for such nation's or
  tribe's official use.
    (c) Each Indian tax exemption coupon  shall  consist  of  a  retention
  portion for a wholesale dealer's recordkeeping purposes and a redemption
  portion  for  a  wholesale  dealer's  submission  to the department when
  claiming a refund as set forth in subdivision four of this section,  and
  shall contain the following information:
    (i) the identity of the Indian nation or tribe to which it is issued;
    (ii)  the  identity  and  the  quantity of the product for which it is
  issued;
    (iii) the date of issuance and the date of expiration; and
    (iv) any other information as the commissioner may deem appropriate.
    3. Tax exempt purchaser. (a) An Indian nation or  tribe  may  purchase
  cigarettes  for  its  own  official  use or consumption from a wholesale
  dealer  licensed  pursuant  to  this  article  without  payment  of  the
  cigarette  tax  to  the  extent that the Indian nation or tribe provides
  such wholesale dealer with Indian tax exemption  coupons  entitling  the
  Indian  nation  or  tribe  to  purchase such quantities of cigarettes as
  allowed for on each Indian  tax  exemption  coupon  without  paying  the
  cigarette tax.
    (b)  A qualified Indian may purchase cigarettes for his or her own use
  or consumption without payment of the cigarette tax, provided  that  the
  qualified Indian makes such purchase on a qualified reservation.
    (c)  A reservation cigarette seller may purchase cigarettes for resale
  without payment of the cigarette tax from a  wholesale  dealer  licensed
  pursuant to this article:
    (i)  provided  that  such  reservation  cigarette  seller  brings such
  cigarettes or causes them to be delivered onto a  qualified  reservation
  for resale on such reservation;
    (ii)  to  the  extent  that such reservation cigarette seller provides
  such wholesale dealer with Indian tax exemption  coupons  entitling  the
  reservation  cigarette  seller to purchase such quantities of cigarettes
  as allowed for on each Indian tax exemption coupon  without  paying  the
  cigarette tax; and
    (iii)  provided  that such cigarettes are affixed with a cigarette tax
  stamp.
    (d) Wholesale dealers shall sell only tax-stamped cigarettes to Indian
  nations  and  tribes,  reservation  cigarette  sellers  and  all   other
  purchasers,  but  shall not collect the cigarette tax from any purchaser
  to the extent the purchaser  gives  such  wholesale  dealer  Indian  tax
  exemption coupons entitling the purchaser to purchase such quantities of
  cigarettes  as  allowed  for  on  each  such Indian tax exemption coupon
  without paying the cigarette tax.
    4. Refunds. A wholesale dealer licensed pursuant to this  article  who
  has one or more Indian tax exemption coupons may file a claim for refund
  as provided for in section four hundred seventy-six of this article with
  respect  to  any  cigarette  tax  previously  paid on cigarettes it sold


 without collecting the tax because it accepted an Indian  tax  exemption
  coupon from its purchaser pursuant to this section.
    5.  Tax  agreements with Indian nations or tribes. If an Indian nation
  or tribe enters into an agreement with the  state  and  the  legislature
  approves   such   agreement  regarding  the  sale  and  distribution  of
  cigarettes on the nation's or tribe's qualified reservation,  the  terms
  of  such  agreement  shall  take  precedence over the provisions of this
  article and exempt such nation from such taxes to the extent  that  such
  taxes  are  specifically  referred  to in the agreement, and the sale or
  distribution,  including  transportation,  of  any  cigarettes  to   the
  nation's  or  tribe's  qualified reservation shall be in accordance with
  the provisions of such agreement.
    6. The failure of the  department  to  establish,  issue  and  provide
  Indian  tax  exemption  coupons, pursuant to subdivisions one and two of
  this section, or to promulgate  any  rules,  regulations  or  directives
  necessary to implement the provisions of this section, shall not relieve
  wholesale  dealers of the obligation to sell only tax-stamped cigarettes
  to Indian nations and tribes, and to reservation cigarette sellers.




   §  472.  Preparation and sale of stamps; commissions; distributors. 1.
  The commissioner shall prescribe, prepare and  furnish  stamps  of  such
  denominations  and quantities as may be necessary for the payment of the
  tax on cigarettes imposed by this article, and may from time to time and
  as often as he deems advisable provide for the  issuance  and  exclusive
  use  of stamps of a new design and forbid the use of stamps of any other
  design, in the manner and  with  the  effect  provided  in  section  two
  hundred  seventy-four  of  this  chapter.  The  commissioner  shall make
  provisions for the sale of such stamps at such places and at such  times
  as  he  may  deem necessary and may license agents for such purpose. The
  commissioner may license dealers in cigarettes,  who  maintain  separate
  warehousing  facilities  for  the  purpose of receiving and distributing
  cigarettes and conducting their business, who have received  commitments
  from  at  least two cigarette manufacturers whose aggregate market share
  is at least forty percent of the New York state  cigarette  market,  and
  importers,  exporters and manufacturers of cigarettes, and other persons
  within or without the state as agents to buy or affix stamps to be  used
  in  paying  the tax herein imposed, but an agent shall at all times have
  the right to appoint the person in his employ who is to affix the stamps
  to any cigarettes under the agent's control. The  fee  for  filing  such
  application  for  an  agent's license shall be one thousand five hundred
  dollars, unless such fee has  been  paid  during  the  preceding  twelve
  months,  in  which case, the fee for a new license shall be one thousand
  dollars. All of the provisions of section four hundred  eighty  relating
  to  wholesale dealers' licenses, including the procedure for suspension,
  revocation, refusal to license and for hearings, except  for  paragraphs
  (c)  and  (g) of subdivision one of such section, shall be applicable to
  agents' licenses applied for or granted pursuant to this section, as  if
  such  provisions  had been set forth in full in this subdivision and had
  expressly referred to the applicant for, or the holder  of,  an  agent's
  license.  Whenever  the  commissioner shall sell and deliver to any such
  agent any such stamps, such  agent  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  as
  compensation  for  his services and expenses as such agent in selling or
  affixing such stamps, and to retain out of the moneys to be paid by  him
  for such stamps, a commission on the par value thereof. The commissioner
  is  hereby  authorized  to  prescribe  a  schedule  of  commissions, not
  exceeding five per centum,  allowable  to  such  agent  for  buying  and
  affixing such stamps. Such schedule shall be uniform with respect to the
  different  types  of  stamps  used, and may be on a graduated scale with
  respect to the number of stamps purchased. The commissioner may, in  his
  discretion,  permit  an  agent to pay for such stamps within thirty days
  after the date of purchase and may require any such agent to  file  with
  the department of taxation and finance a bond issued by a surety company
  approved  by the superintendent of financial services as to solvency and
  responsibility and authorized to transact business in the state or other
  security  acceptable  to  the  commissioner,  in  such  amount  as   the
  commissioner  may  fix,  to secure the payment of any sums due from such
  agent pursuant to this article. If securities are deposited as  security
  under  this subdivision, such securities shall be kept in the custody of
  the commissioner and may be sold  by  the  commissioner  if  it  becomes
  necessary  so  to  do  in  order to recover any sums due from such agent
  pursuant to this article, but no such sale shall be had until after such
  agent shall have had opportunity to litigate the validity of any tax  if
  it  elects  so to do. Upon any such sale, the surplus, if any, above the
  sums due under this article shall be returned to such agent.
    2. A manufacturer or agent  who  intends  to  sell  within  the  state
  packages  of  cigarettes  containing  more  than  twenty cigarettes must
  notify the tax commission, in writing, of  such  intention  one  hundred


 twenty  days  prior  to  the  time such packages will be sold within the
  state, except that such tax commission shall waive such  requirement  if
  it  has  already prescribed, prepared and furnished, or is in a position
  to  prescribe,  prepare  and  furnish in a timely manner, stamps of such
  denomination and quantities as may be necessary for the payment  of  the
  tax  imposed  by  this  article on cigarettes in such package; provided,
  however, that a notice provided  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  within
  fifteen  days  of the effective date of this subdivision shall be deemed
  to have been provided on the effective date of this subdivision.
    3. The commissioner of taxation and finance  may  appoint  dealers  in
  tobacco  products,  manufacturers  of tobacco products and other persons
  within or without the state as distributors and may  authorize  them  to
  make  returns  and  to  pay the tax on tobacco products sold, shipped or
  delivered by them to any person in the state. The commissioner  may,  in
  his discretion, require the deposit of a bond issued by a surety company
  approved  by the superintendent of financial services as to solvency and
  responsibility and authorized to transact business  in  this  state,  or
  other  security  acceptable  to  the  commissioner in an amount and form
  satisfactory to him as a condition of appointing any such  person  as  a
  distributor.   If  securities  are  deposited  as  security  under  this
  subdivision, such securities  shall  be  kept  in  the  custody  of  the
  commissioner of taxation and finance and may be sold by the commissioner
  if  it  becomes necessary so to do in order to recover any sums due from
  such distributor pursuant to this article, but no such sale shall be had
  until after such distributor shall have had an opportunity  to  litigate
  the  validity  of any tax if it elects so to do. Upon any such sale, the
  surplus, if any, above the sums due under this article shall be returned
  to such distributor.




   §  473. Affixation and cancellation of stamps; presumption. Each agent
  shall affix within the time hereinafter prescribed, to each  package  of
  cigarettes,  stamps  evidencing  the  payment of the tax imposed by this
  article and shall cancel such stamps before such cigarettes are  offered
  for  sale  or  before they are otherwise disposed of, unless stamps have
  been affixed to such packages of cigarettes and  cancelled  before  such
  agent received them. Each dealer, other than an agent, shall immediately
  upon  the receipt of any cigarettes at his place of business mark in ink
  on each unopened box, carton or other container of such  cigarettes  the
  word  "received"  and the year, month, day and hour of such receipt, and
  shall affix his signature thereto, or in any other manner prescribed.
    Each retail dealer shall open such  box,  carton  or  other  container
  within  twenty-four  hours  after such receipt and prior to exposing for
  sale or selling such  cigarettes  and  examine  the  packages  contained
  therein for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the said packages
  have  affixed  thereto  the proper tax stamp; if unstamped or improperly
  stamped packages of cigarettes are discovered, the retail  dealer  shall
  immediately  notify the dealer from whom said cigarettes were purchased.
  Upon such notification,  the  dealer  from  whom  said  cigarettes  were
  purchased  will replace such unstamped or improperly stamped packages of
  cigarettes with those upon which stamps have been properly affixed.
    Whenever any cigarettes are found in the place  of  business  of  such
  dealer,  other  than an agent, without the stamps affixed and cancelled,
  or not marked as having been received within the  preceding  twenty-four
  hours, the presumption shall be that such cigarettes are kept therein in
  violation  of the provisions of this article. Stamps shall be affixed to
  each package of cigarettes of an aggregate denomination  not  less  than
  the amount of the tax upon the contents therein, and shall be affixed in
  such manner as to be visible to the purchaser.




   §  473-a. Returns and payment of tobacco products tax by distributors.
  1. Every distributor shall, on or  before  the  twentieth  day  of  each
  month,  file  with  the commissioner of taxation and finance a return on
  forms to be prescribed and furnished by the  commissioner,  showing  the
  quantity  and wholesale price of all tobacco products imported or caused
  to be imported into the state by him or manufactured  in  the  state  by
  him,  during  the preceding calendar month. Every distributor authorized
  by the commissioner to make returns and pay the tax on tobacco  products
  sold,  shipped or delivered by him to any person in the state shall file
  a return showing  the  quantity  and  wholesale  price  of  all  tobacco
  products  so  sold,  shipped  or delivered during the preceding calendar
  month. Provided, however, the commissioner may, if he deems it necessary
  in order to insure the payment of the taxes  imposed  by  this  article,
  require returns to be made at such times and covering such periods as he
  may deem necessary, and, by regulation, may permit the filing of returns
  on  a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis, or may waive the filing of
  returns by a distributor for such time and upon such  terms  as  he  may
  deem  proper if satisfied that no tax imposed by this article is or will
  be payable by him during the time for which  returns  are  waived.  Such
  returns  shall  contain such further information as the commissioner may
  require.
    2. Every distributor shall pay to the commissioner with the filing  of
  such  return  the  tax  on tobacco products for such month imposed under
  this article.




   §  473-b.  Cigarettes  marked  for  export  outside the United States;
  importation and affixation of stamps prohibited. 1.  A  person  may  not
  import  into  this state any cigarettes that have been marked for export
  outside the United States with a label or notice in compliance  with  27
  CFR  §  290.185 or that violates a federal requirement for the placement
  of labels, warnings, or any other information, including health hazards,
  on the individual package.
    2. A person may  not  affix  a  stamp  on  a  package  of  cigarettes,
  cigarette papers, wrappers or tubes unless that individual complies with
  all  federal  tax  laws,  federal  trademark and copyright laws, and all
  federal laws regarding the placement of labels, warnings  or  any  other
  information upon a package of cigarettes, cigarette papers, wrappers, or
  tubes.
    3.  A  person  may  not  affix  a  stamp  on  a package of cigarettes,
  cigarette papers, wrappers, or tubes if that individual package has been
  marked for export outside the United States with a label  or  notice  in
  compliance with 27 CFR § 290.185.




   §  474.  Records  to  be  kept; examination. 1. Every person who shall
  possess or transport any unstamped cigarettes upon the public  highways,
  roads  or  streets of the state, shall be required to have in his actual
  possession invoices  or  delivery  tickets  for  such  cigarettes.  Such
  invoices  or  delivery  tickets  shall  show the name and address of the
  consignor or seller, the name and address of the consignee or purchaser,
  the quantity and brands of the cigarettes transported, and the name  and
  address  of  the  person who has or shall assume the payment of the tax.
  The absence of such invoices or delivery tickets shall  be  prima  facie
  evidence  that  such  person is a dealer in cigarettes in this state and
  subject to the provisions of this article.
    2. Every person who shall possess or transport more than  two  hundred
  fifty   cigars,   or  more  than  five  pounds  of  tobacco  other  than
  roll-your-own tobacco, or more than thirty-six ounces  of  roll-your-own
  tobacco  upon  the public highways, roads or streets of the state, shall
  be required to have  in  his  actual  possession  invoices  or  delivery
  tickets  for  such  tobacco  products. Such invoices or delivery tickets
  shall show the name and address of the consignor or seller, the name and
  address of the consignee or purchaser, the quantity and  brands  of  the
  tobacco products transported, and the name and address of the person who
  has  or  shall  assume the payment of the tax and the wholesale price or
  the tax paid or payable.  The  absence  of  such  invoices  or  delivery
  tickets  shall  be  prima facie evidence that such person is a dealer in
  tobacco products in this state and subject to the requirements  of  this
  article.
    3.  Every  dealer  or distributor or employee thereof, or other person
  acting on behalf of a  dealer  or  distributor,  who  shall  possess  or
  transport  more than fifty cigars or more than one pound of tobacco upon
  the public highways, roads or streets of the state, shall be required to
  have in his actual possession invoices  or  delivery  tickets  for  such
  tobacco  products. Such invoices or delivery tickets shall show the name
  and address of the consignor or seller, the  name  and  address  of  the
  consignee  or purchaser, the quantity and brands of the tobacco products
  transported, and the name and address of the person  who  has  or  shall
  assume the payment of the tax and the wholesale price or the tax paid or
  payable. The absence of such invoices or delivery tickets shall be prima
  facie  evidence that the tax imposed by this article on tobacco products
  has not been paid and is due and owing.
    4. At the time of delivering cigarettes to any person  each  agent  or
  wholesale  dealer, and at the time of delivering tobacco products to any
  person each distributor or wholesale dealer of tobacco  products,  shall
  make  a  true duplicate invoice showing the date of delivery, the number
  of packages and number of cigarettes contained therein, in each shipment
  of cigarettes delivered, and the items and quantity and wholesale  price
  of  each  item  in  each shipment of tobacco products delivered, and the
  name of the purchaser to whom delivery is made,  and  shall  retain  the
  same  for  a  period of three years subject to the use and inspection of
  the commissioner. Each dealer shall procure and retain invoices  showing
  the  number  of  packages and number of cigarettes contained therein, in
  each shipment of cigarettes received by him or her, and  the  items  and
  quantity  and  wholesale  price of each item in each shipment of tobacco
  products received by him or her, the date thereof, and the name  of  the
  shipper,  and  shall retain the same for a period of three years subject
  to the use and inspection  of  the  commissioner.  The  commissioner  by
  regulation  may provide that whenever cigarettes or tobacco products are
  shipped into the state, the railroad company, express company,  trucking
  company  or other public carrier transporting any shipment thereof shall
  file with the commissioner a copy of the freight bill  within  ten  days


 after  the  delivery  in  the  state of each shipment. All dealers shall
  maintain and keep for a period of three  years  such  other  records  of
  cigarettes  or  tobacco  products received, sold or delivered within the
  state as may be required by the commissioner. The commissioner is hereby
  authorized  to  examine the books, papers, invoices and other records of
  any person in possession, control or occupancy  of  any  premises  where
  cigarettes  or  tobacco products are placed, stored, sold or offered for
  sale, and the equipment of any such person pertaining to the stamping of
  cigarettes or the sale and delivery of cigarettes  or  tobacco  products
  taxable  under  this  article,  as  well  as  the stock of cigarettes or
  tobacco products in any such premises or vehicle. To verify the accuracy
  of the tax imposed and assessed by this article,  each  such  person  is
  hereby  directed  and required to give to the commissioner or his or her
  duly authorized representatives, the means, facilities  and  opportunity
  for such examinations as are herein provided for and required.
    5.  Every  accredited  college,  university  or hospital that receives
  research tobacco products as defined in subdivision  twenty  of  section
  four  hundred  seventy  of  this  article  shall, in good faith, file an
  annual information return on or before the last day of January reporting
  all research tobacco products received by such  college,  university  or
  hospital  or  its  affiliated  researcher  within the preceding calendar
  year.  Such  return  shall  be  in  the  form  and  shall  include  such
  information  as  the  commissioner  prescribes by regulation. Any person
  required to file an information return by this subdivision who willfully
  fails to timely file such return  or  willfully  fails  to  provide  any
  material  information  required  to  be  reported  on such return may be
  subject to a penalty of up to one thousand dollars.




   §  475.    General powers of the tax commission.  The powers conferred
  upon the tax commission by sections  one  hundred  seventy-one  and  one
  hundred  seventy-one-b  of  this chapter shall, so far as applicable, be
  exercisable with respect to  the  provisions  of  this  article.    Such
  commission  may  require  returns  to be filed with it at such times and
  containing such information as it may prescribe and in  such  event  the
  fact  that  a person's name is signed to the return shall be prima facie
  evidence for all purposes that the return was actually  signed  by  such
  person.    Notwithstanding  any other provision of this article, the tax
  commission may enter into an agreement with any city of this state which
  is authorized to impose a tax similar to that imposed by this article to
  provide for the joint administration, in  whole  or  in  part,  of  such
  taxes.




   §  476.  Refunds;  sales of stamps. Whenever any cigarettes upon which
  stamps have been placed or tobacco products upon which the tax has  been
  paid have been sold and shipped into another state for sale or use there
  or  have become unfit for use and consumption or unsalable, or have been
  destroyed, or whenever the commissioner of taxation  and  finance  shall
  have  determined  that  any  tax imposed by this article shall have been
  paid in error, the agent, dealer or tobacco products distributor, as the
  case may be, shall be entitled to a refund of the actual amount  of  tax
  so paid, provided application therefor is filed with the commissioner of
  taxation  and  finance within two years after the stamps were affixed to
  such cigarettes or the tax was paid upon such tobacco  products,  except
  if   an   agreement   under  the  provisions  of  section  four  hundred
  seventy-eight (extending the period for determination of tax imposed  by
  this  article)  is  made within the two-year period for the filing of an
  application for refund provided for in  this  section,  the  period  for
  filing  an  application  for refund shall not expire prior to six months
  after the expiration of the period within which a determination  may  be
  made  pursuant  to  the  agreement  or  any  extension  thereof.  If the
  commissioner of taxation and finance is satisfied  that  any  dealer  is
  entitled  to a refund he shall issue to such dealer stamps of sufficient
  value to cover the refund of the tax on cigarettes or  may,  subject  to
  audit  by  the comptroller, make a refund of the tax on cigarettes or on
  tobacco products. No person shall sell or offer for sale  any  stamp  or
  stamps  issued  under  this  article except by written permission of the
  commissioner of taxation and finance. The commissioner of  taxation  and
  finance  may  redeem unused stamps lawfully in possession of any person.
  The commissioner of taxation and finance may prescribe  necessary  rules
  and  regulations  concerning  refunds,  sales of stamps, and redemptions
  under the provisions of this article.




   § 478. Determination of tax. If any person files any return under this
  article,  but such return is incorrect or insufficient, the commissioner
  of taxation and finance shall determine the amount of  tax  due  at  any
  time  within three years after the return was filed (whether or not such
  return was filed on or after the due date), and give written  notice  of
  such  determination  to such person, except that if such person fails to
  file a return or files a  willfully  false  or  fraudulent  return  with
  intent  to  evade  the  tax, such determination may be made at any time.
  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section,  where,
  before  the  expiration  of  the time prescribed in this section for the
  determination of tax, both the commissioner of taxation and finance  and
  the  taxpayer  have consented in writing to its determination after such
  time, the tax may be determined at any time prior to the  expiration  of
  the  period  agreed  upon.  The period so agreed upon may be extended by
  subsequent agreements in writing  made  before  the  expiration  of  the
  period  previously  agreed upon. Any determination made pursuant to this
  section shall finally and irrevocably fix  the  tax  unless  the  person
  against  whom  it is assessed shall, within ninety days after the giving
  of notice of such determination, petition the division  of  tax  appeals
  for  a  hearing.  After  such hearing, the division of tax appeals shall
  give notice of the determination of the administrative law judge to  the
  person  liable  for  the  tax  and  to  the commissioner of taxation and
  finance. Such determination may be reviewed by the tax appeals  tribunal
  as  provided  in  article forty of this chapter. The decision of the tax
  appeals tribunal may be reviewed as provided  in  section  two  thousand
  sixteen  of this chapter, but the proceeding may not be commenced unless
  the amount of tax stated or referred to in the decision, with  penalties
  and  interest  thereon, if any, shall have been first deposited with the
  commissioner of taxation and finance, and an undertaking filed with him,
  in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme  court
  shall  approve, to the effect that if the proceeding be dismissed or the
  decision confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges  which
  may  accrue  against him in the prosecution of the proceeding, or at the
  option of the petitioner such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient  to
  cover  the  tax,  penalties,  interest,  costs and charges aforesaid, in
  which event the petitioner shall  not  be  required  to  pay  such  tax,
  penalties  and  interest as a condition precedent to the commencement of
  the proceeding.
    The remedy provided by this section for review of a  decision  of  the
  tax  appeals  tribunal  shall  be  the exclusive remedy available to any
  taxpayer to judicially determine the  liability  of  such  taxpayer  for
  taxes under this article.




   § 478. Determination of tax. If any person files any return under this
  article,  but such return is incorrect or insufficient, the commissioner
  of taxation and finance shall determine the amount of  tax  due  at  any
  time  within three years after the return was filed (whether or not such
  return was filed on or after the due date), and give written  notice  of
  such  determination  to such person, except that if such person fails to
  file a return or files a  willfully  false  or  fraudulent  return  with
  intent  to  evade  the  tax, such determination may be made at any time.
  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section,  where,
  before  the  expiration  of  the time prescribed in this section for the
  determination of tax, both the commissioner of taxation and finance  and
  the  taxpayer  have consented in writing to its determination after such
  time, the tax may be determined at any time prior to the  expiration  of
  the  period  agreed  upon.  The period so agreed upon may be extended by
  subsequent agreements in writing  made  before  the  expiration  of  the
  period  previously  agreed upon. Any determination made pursuant to this
  section shall finally and irrevocably fix  the  tax  unless  the  person
  against  whom  it is assessed shall, within ninety days after the giving
  of notice of such determination, petition the division  of  tax  appeals
  for  a  hearing.  After  such hearing, the division of tax appeals shall
  give notice of the determination of the administrative law judge to  the
  person  liable  for  the  tax  and  to  the commissioner of taxation and
  finance. Such determination may be reviewed by the tax appeals  tribunal
  as  provided  in  article forty of this chapter. The decision of the tax
  appeals tribunal may be reviewed as provided  in  section  two  thousand
  sixteen  of this chapter, but the proceeding may not be commenced unless
  the amount of tax stated or referred to in the decision, with  penalties
  and  interest  thereon, if any, shall have been first deposited with the
  commissioner of taxation and finance, and an undertaking filed with him,
  in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme  court
  shall  approve, to the effect that if the proceeding be dismissed or the
  decision confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges  which
  may  accrue  against him in the prosecution of the proceeding, or at the
  option of the petitioner such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient  to
  cover  the  tax,  penalties,  interest,  costs and charges aforesaid, in
  which event the petitioner shall  not  be  required  to  pay  such  tax,
  penalties  and  interest as a condition precedent to the commencement of
  the proceeding.
    The remedy provided by this section for review of a  decision  of  the
  tax  appeals  tribunal  shall  be  the exclusive remedy available to any
  taxpayer to judicially determine the  liability  of  such  taxpayer  for
  taxes under this article.




   §  479.  Warrant for the collection of taxes. In addition to all other
  remedies for the collection of any taxes due  under  the  provisions  of
  this  article,  the  tax  commission may issue a warrant directed to the
  sheriff of any county commanding said sheriff to levy upon and sell  the
  real  and  personal  property  of a specified delinquent dealer or other
  person found within his jurisdiction, for the payment of the  amount  of
  such  delinquency  with the added penalties and interest and the cost of
  executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the tax  commission
  and  to  pay  it the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days
  after receipt of such warrant. The sheriff shall, within five days after
  receipt of the warrant, file with the clerk of his county a copy thereof
  and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name  of
  the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalties
  and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy
  is  filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become
  a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal  property  of
  the person against whom the warrant is issued. Such lien shall not apply
  to personal property unless such warrant is also filed in the department
  of  state.  The sheriff to whom any such warrant shall be directed shall
  proceed upon the same in all respects and with like effect  and  in  the
  same manner as prescribed by law in respect to executions issued against
  property  upon  judgments by a court of record, and shall be entitled to
  the same fees for his services in executing the warrant to be  collected
  in the same manner. In the discretion of the tax commission a warrant of
  like  terms,  force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer
  or employee of the department  of  taxation  and  finance,  and  in  the
  execution  thereof  such  officer  or  employee shall have all the power
  conferred by law upon sheriffs, but he shall be entitled to  no  fee  or
  compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of
  such duty.  Upon such filing of a warrant, the tax commission shall have
  the  same  remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the state
  had recovered judgment therefor.




   §  480.  License.  1.  General.  (a) On and after July first, nineteen
  hundred thirty-nine no person shall be a wholesale dealer unless he  has
  been  granted  and  publicly displays in his place of business a license
  from the department. Applications for licenses shall be  made  on  forms
  prescribed by the commissioner.
    (b)  Applications  shall  be  accompanied  by proof of the applicant's
  financial responsibility, including, but not  limited  to,  satisfactory
  proof  of  a  minimum  net  worth of twenty-five thousand dollars if the
  applicant is an individual, or net worth in the  capitalization  of  the
  business  if  the  applicant  is not an individual equal to a minimum of
  twenty-five thousand dollars.
    (c) Each applicant shall file with the department a bond issued  by  a
  surety  company  approved by the superintendent of financial services as
  to solvency and responsibility and authorized to  transact  business  in
  the state, in the face amount of ten thousand dollars, to secure payment
  of  any sums due for any violation of article twenty or article twenty-A
  of this chapter, or the regulations of the commissioner thereunder.
    (d) Each applicant shall file satisfactory proof that it will maintain
  a secure separate warehousing facility for the purpose of receiving  and
  distributing cigarettes or tobacco products and conducting its wholesale
  business.  Such proof shall consist of a copy of a deed, or a copy of an
  executed lease for a minimum period of two years, to a separate,  secure
  warehouse.  If  the applicant carries on another business in conjunction
  with  the  warehouse  facility,  the  other  business  shall   also   be
  identified.
    (e)  Each applicant shall file satisfactory proof that it will provide
  disability and workers' compensation insurance for its employees.
    (f) Each applicant shall submit proof of United States citizenship  or
  eligibility  to  obtain  employment  within  the  United States if not a
  citizen. If the applicant is not an  individual,  such  proof  shall  be
  submitted with respect to each controlling person of the applicant.
    (g)  The  fee  for the filing of an application for a license shall be
  fifteen hundred dollars, unless  such  fee  has  been  paid  during  the
  preceding  twelve months, in which case, the fee for a new license shall
  be one thousand dollars. Each application  shall  be  accompanied  by  a
  certified check for the required application fee.
    (h)  Except as provided in subdivision four of this section, a license
  shall continue in  effect  until  revoked  or  suspended  for  cause  or
  surrendered.
    (i)  A  license  shall  not  be  assignable  but  an  applicant who is
  purchasing the business of a licensee shall file a copy of the  contract
  of sale and any related documents with its application.
    (j)  The commissioner may for cause refuse to issue, or may suspend or
  revoke a wholesaler's license, or may forbid a retail dealer to continue
  selling cigarettes or tobacco products or may forbid a  person  required
  to be appointed as a distributor of tobacco products who has not been so
  appointed   from  selling  cigarettes  or  tobacco  products,  after  an
  opportunity for hearing has been afforded. A violation of any  provision
  of  this  article or of any regulation issued under it shall be cause to
  forbid a  retail  dealer  to  continue  selling  cigarettes  or  tobacco
  products.
    (k)  No  agent  shall  sell  cigarettes  and no distributor shall sell
  tobacco products to an unlicensed wholesale dealer, or  to  a  wholesale
  dealer  whose  license  has  been  suspended  or revoked, or to a retail
  dealer who is not registered under section four hundred eighty-a of this
  article, or whose registration has been suspended  or  revoked,  and  no
  wholesale  dealer  shall sell cigarettes or tobacco products to a retail
  dealer who is not registered under section four hundred eighty-a of this


 article, or whose registration has been suspended  or  revoked,  and  no
  retail  dealer  shall  sell  cigarettes  or tobacco products unless such
  dealer is  registered  under  section  four  hundred  eighty-a  of  this
  article.
    (l) Paragraphs (b), (c) and (g) of this subdivision shall not apply to
  the filing of an application for a license as a wholesale dealer that is
  based solely upon the ownership, operation or maintenance of one or more
  cigarette  or  tobacco products vending machines in, at or upon premises
  owned or occupied by another person, or that is based  solely  upon  the
  sale  of  tobacco  products  for  resale, or that is based upon both the
  ownership, operation or maintenance of one or more cigarette or  tobacco
  products  vending  machines in, at or upon premises owned or occupied by
  another person and the sale of tobacco products for resale.
    2. Refusal to license. The commissioner of taxation  and  finance  may
  refuse to license an applicant where such applicant files an application
  under  this section and in considering such application the commissioner
  ascertains that:
    (a) Any tax imposed under this chapter or under any related statute as
  defined in section eighteen hundred of this  chapter  has  been  finally
  determined  to be due from such applicant or controlling person and such
  tax has not been paid in full,
    (b) Such applicant or any controlling person has been convicted  of  a
  crime provided for in this chapter within the preceding five years,
    (c)  Such  applicant  or  any  controlling  person was the controlling
  person in another wholesale dealer at the time that:
    (i) Any tax imposed under this  chapter  or  any  related  statute  as
  defined  in  section  eighteen  hundred  of  this  chapter  was  finally
  determined to be due from such other wholesale dealer and such  tax  has
  not been paid in full,
    (ii) Such other wholesale dealer was convicted of a crime provided for
  in this chapter within the preceding five years, or
    (iii)  The  license  of  such  other wholesale dealer was cancelled or
  suspended pursuant to this section within the preceding five years,
    (d) The license of such applicant  has  been  cancelled  or  suspended
  pursuant to this section within the preceding five years,
    (e)  Any controlling person of such applicant has committed any of the
  acts specified in subdivision three of this section within the preceding
  five years, or
    (f)  Such  applicant  or  any  controlling  person  has  been  finally
  determined  to  have  violated  any of the provisions of this article or
  article twenty-A of this chapter, or  any  rule  or  regulation  adopted
  pursuant to this article or article twenty-A of this chapter.
    3. Cancellation or suspension of license.
    (a)  Acts  of  licensee.  The  license  of any wholesale dealer may be
  cancelled or suspended by the tax commission upon:
    (i) Its failure to file or maintain in full force and effect a bond or
  other security when required or when the amount thereof is increased,
    (ii) Its failure to comply with any of the provisions of this  article
  or  article  twenty-A  of this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted
  pursuant to this article or article twenty-A  of  this  chapter  by  the
  department or the commissioner, provided, however, that any violation of
  section  four  hundred  seventy-three-b  of this article shall result in
  license cancellation,
    (iii) Its knowingly aiding and abetting another  person  in  violating
  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  article  or article twenty-A of this
  chapter or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to  this  article  or
  article  twenty-A of this chapter by the department or the commissioner,


 provided,  however,  that  any  violation  of   section   four   hundred
  seventy-three-b of this article shall result in license cancellation.
    (b) Acts of licensee or controlling person. A license may be cancelled
  or  suspended  if  the  tax commission determines that a licensee or any
  controlling person:
    (i) Commits fraud or deceit in his or its operations  as  a  wholesale
  dealer or has committed fraud or deceit in procuring his or its license,
    (ii)  Has  been convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction, either
  within or without the state, of a  felony,  bearing  on  the  licensee's
  duties and obligations under this chapter,
    (iii) Has impersonated any person represented to be a wholesale dealer
  under this article but not in fact licensed under this section, or
    (iv) Has knowingly aided and abetted the sale of cigarettes or tobacco
  products by a person which such licensee or controlling person knows (A)
  has  not  been  licensed by the commissioner of taxation and finance and
  (B) is a wholesale dealer pursuant to the terms of subdivision eight  of
  section four hundred seventy of this chapter.
    4.  If the commissioner of taxation and finance considers it necessary
  for the proper administration of the cigarette tax or  tobacco  products
  tax  imposed  by  this  article  or  the  cigarette  marketing standards
  contained in article twenty-A of  this  chapter  he  may  require  every
  person  under this article who holds a license to file a new application
  for a license in such form and at such  time  as  the  commissioner  may
  prescribe  and  to  surrender such license. The commissioner may require
  such filing and such surrender not more  often  than  once  every  three
  years.  Upon  the filing of such application with the proper fee and the
  surrender of such license, the commissioner  shall  issue,  within  such
  time as he may prescribe, a new license to each applicant.
    5.  Hearing  procedure. (a) General. A notice of proposed cancellation
  or suspension of a license or refusal to issue a license shall be  given
  to  the  wholesale  dealer  licensed  pursuant  to this article or to an
  applicant applying for such license  in  the  manner  prescribed  for  a
  notice  of  deficiency  of  tax  and  all the provisions applicable to a
  notice  of  deficiency  under  article  twenty-seven  of  this  chapter,
  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those provisions authorizing the tax
  commission to abate on its own motion, shall apply to  a  notice  issued
  pursuant  to  this  subdivision,  insofar as such provisions can be made
  applicable to  a  notice  authorized  by  this  subdivision,  with  such
  modifications as may be necessary in order to adapt the language of such
  provisions  to the notice authorized by this subdivision. Such notice of
  proposed cancellation or suspension or of proposed  refusal  to  license
  must  be given to such person within five years from the date of the act
  or omission referred to in subdivision two or  three  of  this  section,
  except  that in the case of acts involving falsity or fraud, such notice
  may be issued at any time. All of such notices shall contain a statement
  advising the  person  to  whom  it  is  issued  that  the  cancellation,
  suspension  or  refusal  to  license may be challenged through a hearing
  process and that the petition for such challenge must be filed with  the
  tax commission within ninety days after the giving of such notice. Where
  a license is cancelled or suspended prior to a hearing, the cancellation
  or suspension may be challenged through the hearing process provided the
  petition for such challenge is filed within ninety days after the giving
  of notice of such cancellation or suspension.
    (b)  Refusal  to  license.  In  the  case  of  a person applying to be
  licensed as a wholesale dealer, a notice of proposed refusal to  license
  shall  be  issued  promptly after application for license is received by
  the tax commission. Upon timely application therefor, a hearing shall be
  scheduled, and within three months from  such  application  for  hearing


 (determined with regard to any postponements of any scheduled hearing or
  conference  or other delay made at the request of the applicant) the tax
  commission shall issue a notice of refusal to license or  shall  license
  the  applicant. If the tax commission fails to issue a notice of refusal
  to license within such three month period (or such  period  as  extended
  pursuant  to  this  paragraph),  the  tax  commission  shall license the
  applicant immediately upon the conclusion of such period so long as  the
  applicant  has  filed  a  bond  or other security as required by the tax
  commission.
    6. For purposes of this section, the term "controlling  person"  means
  any person who is:
    (a)  An  officer,  director  or  partner  or, in the case of a limited
  liability company, a member or a person  having  with  respect  to  such
  limited  liability  company authority analogous to that of an officer or
  director with respect to a corporation of an applicant for  a  wholesale
  dealer's license or of a licensee under this article, or
    (b) A shareholder, directly or indirectly owning more than ten percent
  of  the  number  of shares of stock of such applicant or licensee (where
  such applicant or  licensee  is  a  corporation)  entitling  the  holder
  thereof  to vote for the election of directors or trustees. For purposes
  of this paragraph, where reference is made  to  ownership,  directly  or
  indirectly,  of  more  than  ten  percent  of the shares of stock of the
  applicant or another person entitling the holder thereof to vote for the
  election of directors or trustees,  in  the  case  of  an  applicant  or
  another person which at the relevant time has four or fewer shareholders
  holding shares entitling the holders thereof to vote for the election of
  directors  or trustees, twenty-five percent or more shall be substituted
  as the applicable percentage in such references to  ownership,  directly
  or indirectly, of voting stock.




   § 480-a. Retail dealer and vending machine registration. 1. (a) On and
  after  January  first,  nineteen hundred ninety-one, every retail dealer
  shall publicly display a certificate of registration from the department
  in each  place  of  business  in  this  state  through  which  it  sells
  cigarettes  or  tobacco  products  at retail. A retail dealer who has no
  regular place of business shall publicly  display  such  certificate  on
  each of its carts, stands, trucks or other merchandising devices through
  which it sells cigarettes or tobacco products in this state.
    (b)  Every  person who owns or, if the owner is not the operator, then
  any person who operates one  or  more  vending  machines  through  which
  cigarettes  or  tobacco  products  are sold in this state, regardless of
  whether located on the premises of the vending machine owner or, if  the
  owner  is  not  the  operator,  then the premises of the operator or the
  premises of any other person, must register each  such  vending  machine
  with  the  department.  On  and  after  January  first, nineteen hundred
  ninety-one, a vending machine registration certificate, in such form  as
  may  be prescribed by the commissioner of taxation and finance, shall be
  affixed to each vending machine  through  which  cigarettes  or  tobacco
  products are sold in this state.
    (c)  Registrations  of  retail  dealers  and vending machines shall be
  valid for a calendar year period upon payment of the fee  prescribed  in
  subdivision  two  of  this  section  and  must be renewed each year upon
  payment  of  such  fee.  A  registration  shall  not  be  assignable  or
  transferable.  In  the case of retail dealers a registration certificate
  shall be surrendered to  the  department  immediately  upon  the  retail
  dealer's  ceasing  to  do  business  as  specified  in  the registration
  certificate, or in the event that such business never commenced.
    (d) (i) The commissioner shall not register  retail  dealers  or  such
  registration  may  be  cancelled  or  suspended by the commissioner upon
  notification that the applicant or retail dealer has been convicted in a
  criminal proceeding of a violation of subdivision five of section 260.20
  of the penal law or as directed by an enforcement  officer  pursuant  to
  article  thirteen-F  of  the  public  health law. The clerk of the court
  shall promptly report all criminal convictions under subdivision five of
  section 260.20 of the penal law to the  commissioner,  together  with  a
  direction  to the commissioner to cancel such registration or to suspend
  it for a specified period of time. Anything to the contrary in  any  law
  notwithstanding,  retail  dealers shall have no right to a hearing under
  this chapter and shall have no right  to  commence  a  court  action  or
  proceeding  or to any other legal recourse against the commissioner with
  respect to any action taken by the commissioner  under  this  paragraph,
  provided  nothing  herein  shall  be  construed to deny retail dealers a
  hearing under article thirteen-F of the public health law or to prohibit
  retail dealers from commencing a court action or proceeding  against  an
  enforcement   officer   as   defined   in   section   thirteen   hundred
  ninety-nine-aa of the public health law.
    (ii)  Anything  to  the  contrary  in  any  law  notwithstanding,  the
  commissioner  shall  provide  upon  request to an enforcement officer as
  defined in section thirteen hundred ninety-nine-aa of the public  health
  law  such  registration information as is relevant and necessary for the
  implementation of article thirteen-F of the public health law.
    (e) The commissioner may refuse to register as a retail dealer or  may
  revoke  the  registration  of  a  retail dealer where the applicant's or
  retail dealer's place of business is at the same premises as that  of  a
  retail  dealer  whose  retail  dealer  registration has been revoked and
  where such revocation is still in effect, unless the applicant or retail
  dealer   provides   the   commissioner   with   adequate   documentation
  demonstrating that such applicant or retail dealer acquired the premises


 or  business  through  an  arm's  length  transaction as defined in this
  paragraph and that the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole  or  in
  part, for the purpose of permitting the original registrant to avoid the
  effect of the previous revocation for the same premises. For purposes of
  this  paragraph, "arm's length transaction" means a sale of a fee or all
  undivided interests in real property, or lease of any part thereof, or a
  sale of a business, in good faith and for valuable  consideration,  that
  reflects  the  fair  market  value  of  such  real property or lease, or
  business, in the open market, between two informed and willing  parties,
  where neither is under any compulsion to participate in the transaction,
  unaffected by any unusual conditions indicating a reasonable possibility
  that  the  sale  or  lease  was  made  for the purpose of permitting the
  original registrant to avoid the effect of the previous  revocation  for
  the  same  premises. The following sales or leases shall be presumed not
  to  be  arm's  length  transactions  unless  adequate  documentation  is
  provided  demonstrating  that  the  sale  or lease was not conducted, in
  whole or in part, for the purpose of permitting the original  registrant
  to avoid the effect of the previous revocation for the same premises:
    (i) a sale between relatives; or
    (ii) a sale between related companies or partners in a business; or
    (iii)  a  sale  or lease affected by other facts or circumstances that
  would indicate that the sale or lease is entered into  for  the  primary
  purpose of permitting the original registrant to avoid the effect of the
  previous revocation for the same premises.
    (f) In addition to the grounds for refusal of a registration specified
  in  section eleven hundred thirty-four of this chapter, the commissioner
  may refuse to register any person as a retail dealer where any tax under
  this chapter, or a tax or fee administered by the commissioner under any
  other law, has been finally determined to be due from  such  person,  or
  from  a  person  required  to collect tax with respect to such person or
  another person, and has not been paid.
    2. (a) (i) Every retail dealer and every  person  owning  or,  if  the
  owner is not the operator, then any person operating one or more vending
  machines  through  which cigarettes or tobacco products are sold in this
  state, who is required under section eleven hundred thirty-six  of  this
  chapter to file a return for the quarterly period ending on the last day
  of August, nineteen hundred ninety or for the quarterly period ending on
  the  last day of August in any year thereafter, must file an application
  for registration under this section with that quarterly return, in  such
  form as shall be prescribed by the commissioner.
    (ii) Each retail dealer must pay an application fee with the quarterly
  return  of  three  hundred  dollars for each retail place of business in
  this state through which it sells cigarettes or tobacco products.
    (iii) Every person who owns or, if the owner is not the operator, then
  any person who operates one  or  more  vending  machines  through  which
  cigarettes  or  tobacco  products  are sold in this state, regardless of
  whether located on the premises of the vending machine owner or, if  the
  owner  is  not  the  operator,  then the premises of the operator or the
  premises of any other person, must  pay  an  application  fee  with  the
  quarterly  return  of  one hundred dollars for each vending machine. The
  department will issue a registration certificate, as prescribed  by  the
  commissioner,  after  receipt  of  a  registration  application  and the
  appropriate registration fee,  prior  to  the  next  succeeding  January
  first.
    (b)  Every retail dealer and every person who owns or, if the owner is
  not the operator, then any person  who  operates  one  or  more  vending
  machines  through  which cigarettes or tobacco products are sold in this
  state who commences business after the  last  day  of  August,  nineteen


 hundred  ninety, or who commences selling cigarettes or tobacco products
  at retail through a new or different place of  business  in  this  state
  after such date, or who commences selling cigarettes or tobacco products
  through  new  or  different  vending machines after such date, must file
  with the  commissioner  an  application  for  registration,  in  a  form
  prescribed  by  him  or  her,  at  least thirty days prior to commencing
  business or commencing sales. Each application must be accompanied by an
  application fee of three  hundred  dollars  for  each  retail  place  of
  business  and  one  hundred  dollars  for  each  vending  machine  to be
  registered.  The  department,  within  ten  days  after  receipt  of  an
  application  for  registration  under  this paragraph and payment of the
  proper fee for application for registration, will issue  a  registration
  certificate, as prescribed by the commissioner, for each retail place of
  business or cigarette or tobacco products vending machine registered.
    (c)  In addition to the powers granted to the commissioner of taxation
  and finance in this chapter, the commissioner is  hereby  authorized  to
  make  provisions  for  the joint administration, in whole or in part, of
  the state and local taxes imposed by article twenty-eight and authorized
  to  be  imposed  by  article  twenty-nine  of  this  chapter   and   the
  registrations and fees for application for registration required by this
  section,  including  the  joint  reporting,  assessment,  collection and
  determination of such taxes and the registration and fees  provided  for
  in  this  section,  and  for  that purpose, to prescribe that any of the
  commissioner's functions under such articles or this  section,  and  any
  returns,  forms, statements, documents or information to be submitted to
  the commissioner under such articles or  this  section,  any  books  and
  records to be kept for purposes of the taxes imposed or authorized to be
  imposed  by such articles or for purposes of this section, any schedules
  of amounts to be collected under such  articles  or  this  section,  any
  registration  required  under  such  articles  or  this section, and the
  payment of taxes under such articles, or  of  fees  under  this  section
  shall be on a joint basis.
    (d)  Except  as otherwise provided in this section, all the provisions
  of article  twenty-eight  of  this  chapter  relating  to  the  personal
  liability  for  the tax, administration, collection and determination of
  tax, and deposit and disposition of revenue,  including  section  eleven
  hundred  thirty-eight  of  this chapter relating to determination of tax
  and  section  eleven  hundred  forty-five  of  this  chapter  (but  only
  paragraphs  one  and two of subdivision (a) of such section) relating to
  penalties and interest for failure to file a return or  pay  tax  within
  the  time required, shall apply to the applications for registration and
  the fees for filing such applications required by this section  and  the
  penalty  imposed  pursuant  to  subdivision three of this section, as if
  such applications were returns required  under  section  eleven  hundred
  thirty-six  of this chapter and such filing fees, penalties and interest
  were taxes required to be paid pursuant to such article twenty-eight, in
  the same manner and with the same force and effect as if the language of
  such provisions of such article twenty-eight had  been  incorporated  in
  full  into this article, except to the extent that any such provision is
  either inconsistent with a provision of this section or is not  relevant
  thereto  and  with such other modifications as may be necessary to adapt
  the language of such provisions  to  the  provisions  of  this  section.
  Provided,  however,  that the commissioner of taxation and finance shall
  refund  or  credit  an  application  fee  paid  with  respect   to   the
  registration  of a vending machine or a retail place of business in this
  state through which cigarettes or tobacco products were to be  sold  if,
  prior  to  the beginning of the calendar year with respect to which such
  registration relates,  the  certificate  of  registration  described  in


 paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision  is  returned to the department of
  taxation and finance, or if such certificate  has  been  destroyed,  the
  retail dealer or vending machine operator satisfactorily accounts to the
  commissioner  for  the  missing certificate, but such vending machine or
  retail place of business may not be used to sell cigarettes  or  tobacco
  products  in  this  state  during  such  calendar  year,  unless  it  is
  re-registered. The provisions of section eleven hundred  thirty-nine  of
  this  chapter  shall  apply  to  the  refund or credit authorized by the
  preceding sentence and for such purposes, such refund or credit shall be
  deemed a refund of tax paid in  error  provided,  however,  no  interest
  shall be allowed or paid on any such refund.
    3.  In  addition to any other penalty imposed by this chapter: (a) Any
  retail dealer who violates the provisions of  this  section,  after  due
  notice and an opportunity for a hearing, for a first violation is liable
  for  a  civil fine not less than five thousand dollars but not to exceed
  twenty-five thousand dollars and for a second  or  subsequent  violation
  within  three years following a prior finding of violation is liable for
  a civil fine not less than  ten  thousand  dollars  but  not  to  exceed
  thirty-five thousand dollars; or
    (b) Any person who owns or, if the owner is not the operator, then any
  person   who  operates  one  or  more  vending  machines  through  which
  cigarettes or tobacco products are sold in this state and  who  violates
  the  provisions of this section, after due notice and an opportunity for
  a hearing, for a first violation is liable for a  civil  fine  not  less
  than  seven hundred fifty dollars but not to exceed two thousand dollars
  and for a second or subsequent violation within three years following  a
  prior  finding of violation be liable for a civil fine not less than two
  thousand dollars but not to exceed six thousand dollars.
    (c) If a retail dealer does not possess a valid  registration,  either
  because  it  failed  to  obtain  a  registration  or its registration is
  suspended or revoked and the commissioner or their designee, pursuant to
  their authority under this article, attempts to  inspect  such  premises
  for  a  violation  of  this section and such retail dealer, including an
  agent thereof, is found, after notice and opportunity to  be  heard,  to
  have  refused  such inspection, such retail dealer shall be subject to a
  penalty of up to four thousand dollars for a first  refusal  and  up  to
  eight  thousand  dollars for a second or subsequent refusal within three
  years of a prior refusal.
    4. (a) If a retail dealer possesses or sells unstamped  or  unlawfully
  stamped  packages  of cigarettes, or if a retail dealer is also licensed
  as an  agent  pursuant  to  section  four  hundred  seventy-two  and  it
  possesses  unlawfully  stamped packages of cigarettes or sells unstamped
  or  unlawfully  stamped  packages  of  cigarettes  at  retail,  (i)  its
  registration  shall  be  revoked for a period of one year, or (ii) for a
  second such possession or sale within a period of five years by a retail
  dealer or any affiliated person of such retail dealer, the  registration
  of  such retail dealer and the registration of any retail dealer that is
  an affiliated person of such retail dealer shall be revoked for a period
  of three years, or (iii) for a third such possession or  sale  within  a
  period of five years by a retail dealer or any affiliated person of such
  retail   dealer,   the  registration  of  such  retail  dealer  and  the
  registration of any retail dealer that is an affiliated person  of  such
  retail  dealer  shall  be  revoked  for a period of five years. A retail
  dealer registration  shall  be  revoked  pursuant  to  this  subdivision
  immediately  upon  such dealer's receipt of written notice of revocation
  from the commissioner. If unstamped or unlawfully stamped cigarettes are
  found in a retail dealer's warehouse or a warehouse  of  any  affiliated
  person  of  such  retail  dealer,  the revocation of the retail dealer's


 registration pursuant to this subdivision shall be  applicable  to  each
  retail  place of business in this state through which such retail dealer
  and any affiliated person of such retail dealer sells cigarettes.
    (a-1)  If  a  retail  dealer,  including  an agent thereof, refuses to
  comply with the requirements of subdivision four of section four hundred
  seventy-four of this article its registration may be revoked (i)  for  a
  period  of one year, or (ii) for a second such violation within a period
  of five years for up to three years, or (iii) for a third or  subsequent
  violation within a period of seven years for a period up to ten years. A
  retail dealer registration shall be considered to be revoked pursuant to
  this  subdivision  immediately  upon  such  dealer's  receipt of written
  notice of revocation from the commissioner.
    (b)  A  retail  dealer  who  is  notified  of  a  revocation  of   its
  registration  pursuant  to this subdivision shall have the right to have
  the revocation reviewed by the commissioner or his or  her  designee  by
  contacting  the  department  at  a  telephone number or an address to be
  disclosed in the notice of revocation within ten days of  such  dealer's
  receipt  of  such  notification.  The  retail dealer may present written
  evidence or argument in support of its defense to the revocation, or may
  appear at a scheduled conference with the commissioner  or  his  or  her
  designee  to  present  oral  arguments  and written and oral evidence in
  support of such defense. The commissioner or  his  or  her  designee  is
  authorized  to  delay the effective date of the revocation to enable the
  retail dealer to present further evidence  or  arguments  in  connection
  with  the  revocation.    The  commissioner or his or her designee shall
  cancel the revocation of registration if the commissioner or his or  her
  designee  is  not  satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that the
  retail dealer violated paragraph (a) or (a-1) of  this  subdivision,  as
  may be applicable.
    (c)  An  order of revocation of a retail dealer registration shall not
  be reviewable by the division  of  tax  appeals,  but  may  be  reviewed
  pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules by
  a  proceeding  commenced  in the supreme court within four months of the
  revocation of registration petitioning that the order of  revocation  be
  enjoined or set aside. Such proceeding shall be instituted in the county
  where  the commissioner has his or her principal office. Upon the filing
  of such petition the court shall have jurisdiction  to  set  aside  such
  order  of  revocation,  in whole or in part, or to dismiss the petition.
  The jurisdiction of the supreme court shall be exclusive and  its  order
  dismissing  the  petition  or  enjoining or setting aside such order, in
  whole or in part, shall be final, subject to  review  by  the  appellate
  division  of  the  supreme  court  and  the court of appeals in the same
  manner and form and with the same effect as provided by law for  appeals
  from  a  judgment in a special proceeding. All such proceedings shall be
  heard and determined  by  the  court  and  by  any  appellate  court  as
  expeditiously  as  possible  and with lawful precedence over other civil
  matters. All such proceedings for review shall be heard on the petition,
  transcript and other papers, and on appeal shall be heard on the record,

  whose registration for such location is suspended or revoked pursuant to
  this section. In addition, notice of such revocation shall also be given

  cause, for purposes of section one hundred  eighteen  of  the  alcoholic
  beverage  control law, for revocation, cancellation or suspension of any
  license or permit issued pursuant to such law.
    5. Except for subdivision (i) of section eighteen hundred fourteen  of

  forbiddance  from  selling  or  transferring  its  inventory of lawfully
  stamped cigarettes or tobacco products on which  the  taxes  imposed  by
  this  article  have been assumed or paid to a properly registered retail
  dealer whose registration is not cancelled, suspended, or revoked or who
  has not been forbidden from selling cigarettes or tobacco products.
    (b) No retail dealer shall possess cigarettes or tobacco  products  in

  regard  to  any extension of time for filing or paying) shall be subject
  to a penalty of ten per centum of the amount of tax determined to be due
  as provided in this article plus one per centum of such amount for  each
  month  or fraction thereof during which such failure continues after the

  or such  tax  became  due,  not  exceeding  thirty  per  centum  in  the
  aggregate.
    (B)  If  a tax on cigarettes or on tobacco products under this article

    (C) In the case of a failure to file such return within sixty days  of
  the  date  prescribed  for  filing of such return by or pursuant to this

  date paid, whether or not any extension of time for payment was granted.
  Interest under this subparagraph shall not be paid if the amount thereof
  is less than one dollar.
    (iii) If the tax commission determines that such failure or delay  was
  due  to  reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, it shall remit
  all or part of such penalty. The tax commission shall  promulgate  rules
  and regulations as to what constitutes reasonable cause.
    (iv)  If  the  failure  to  pay any tax within the time required by or
  pursuant to this article is due to fraud, in lieu of the  penalties  and
  interest  provided  for in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph,
  there shall be added to the tax (A) a penalty of two times the amount of
  tax due, plus (B) interest on such unpaid tax at the  underpayment  rate

  for paying) and ending on the day on which such tax is paid.
    (v) The penalties and interest provided for in this paragraph shall be
  determined, assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as the taxes

  maintains  fifteen  or more retail outlets in New York state, having one
  hundred percent common ownership, through which cigarettes are  sold  at

  fifteen separate outlets shall be considered  to  be  chain  stores.  It
  shall  also  include  cooperative  members, franchisees and large volume

  cooperative which operates a distribution center or the sharing  in  the
  profits  and  losses  requirement  of this paragraph five, and upon each
  successive reregistration pursuant to section four  hundred  eighty-nine
  of  this  chapter, such cooperative members shall not be subject to such
  requirements, but shall be subject to all  other  requirements  of  this
  article.
    6.  "Franchisee"  shall mean any person or persons engaged in the sale
  of cigarettes as a retail dealer who is a  "franchisee"  as  defined  in
  article  thirty-three  of the general business law, and whose franchisor


 franchises fifteen or more separate retail establishments  in  New  York
  state through which cigarettes are sold.
    7. "Large volume outlet operator" shall mean any person or persons who
  sell  cigarettes  at one or more retail outlets each of which had annual
  gross sales in the previous calendar  year  of  more  than  two  million
  dollars excluding petroleum products in this state.
    (b)  1.  (A) The term "cost of the agent" shall mean the basic cost of
  cigarettes plus the cost of doing business by the agent as evidenced  by
  the accounting standards and methods regularly employed by said agent in
  his  determination  of  costs  for  the  purpose  of  federal income tax
  reporting for  the  total  operation  of  his  establishment,  and  must
  include, without limitation, labor, including salaries of executives and
  officers,  rent,  depreciation, selling costs, maintenance of equipment,
  delivery  costs,  interest  payable,  all  types  of  licenses,   taxes,
  insurance  and  advertising expressed as a percentage and applied to the
  basic cost of cigarettes. Any fractional part of a cent in the  cost  to
  the  agent  per  carton  of  cigarettes shall be rounded off to the next
  higher cent. In the case of sales at retail by an agent,  the  "cost  of
  the  agent" shall be the same as the "cost of the retail dealer". In the
  case of sales of cigarettes to a chain  store  having  fifteen  or  more
  retail outlets, excluding vending machine operators, which are delivered
  to  a central warehouse owned and operated by such chain store and which
  are delivered to its retail outlets by the chain store, the "cost of the
  agent" shall be presumed to be the basic cost of cigarettes. There shall
  be determined a separate cost  of  the  agent  for  sales  to  wholesale
  dealers and for sales to retail dealers.
    (B) In the absence of the filing with the commissioner of satisfactory
  proof  of  a lesser cost of doing business of the agent making the sale,
  the cost of doing  business  by  the  agent  shall  be  presumed  to  be
  seven-eighths  of  one percent of the basic cost of cigarettes for sales
  to wholesale dealers plus one cent per package of  ten  cigarettes,  two
  cents  per  package  of  twenty  cigarettes and in the case of a package
  containing more than twenty cigarettes, two cents and one-half of a cent
  for each five  cigarettes  in  excess  of  twenty  cigarettes,  one  and
  one-half  percent  of  the  basic  cost of cigarettes for sales to chain
  stores plus one cent per  package  of  ten  cigarettes,  two  cents  per
  package  of  twenty  cigarettes  and in the case of a package containing
  more than twenty cigarettes, two cents and one-half of a cent  for  each
  five   cigarettes   in   excess  of  twenty  cigarettes  and  three  and
  seven-eighths percent of the basic cost of cigarettes  with  respect  to
  sales to retail dealers plus one cent per package of ten cigarettes, two
  cents  per  package  of  twenty  cigarettes and in the case of a package
  containing more than twenty cigarettes, two cents and one-half of a cent
  for each  five  cigarettes  in  excess  of  twenty  cigarettes  and  the
  foregoing  cents  per  pack  shall  be  included  in  the "cost of doing
  business by the agent" referred to in paragraphs two and three  of  this
  subdivision.
    2.  (A)  The  term "cost of the wholesale dealer" shall mean the basic
  cost of cigarettes plus the cost of  doing  business  by  the  wholesale
  dealer  as  evidenced  by the accounting standards and methods regularly
  employed by said wholesale dealer in his determination of costs for  the
  purpose  of  federal income tax reporting for the total operation of his
  establishment, and must include, without  limitation,  labor,  including
  salaries  of executives and officers, rent, depreciation, selling costs,
  maintenance of equipment, delivery costs, interest payable, all types of
  licenses, taxes, insurance and advertising expressed as a percentage and
  applied to the basic cost of cigarettes, plus the cost of doing business
  by the agent with respect to sales of cigarettes to  wholesale  dealers.


 Any  fractional  part  of a cent in the cost to the wholesale dealer per
  carton of cigarettes shall be rounded off to the next  higher  cent.  In
  the  case  of  sales  at  retail by a wholesale dealer, the "cost of the
  wholesale  dealer" shall be the same as the "cost of the retail dealer".
  There shall be determined a separate cost of the  wholesale  dealer  for
  sales to chain stores and for sales to retail dealers.
    (B)  In  the  absence  of  the  filing  with  the  tax  commission  of
  satisfactory proof of a lesser cost of doing business of  the  wholesale
  dealer  making  the  sale,  the  cost of doing business by the wholesale
  dealer with respect to sales to retail dealers shall be presumed  to  be
  three  per  centum  of the basic cost of cigarettes, and with respect to
  sales to chain stores, five-eighths of one percent of the basic cost  of
  cigarettes.
    3.  (A) The term "cost of the retail dealer" shall mean the basic cost
  of cigarettes plus the cost of doing business by the  retail  dealer  as
  evidenced  by the accounting standards and methods regularly employed by
  said retail dealer in his determination of  costs  for  the  purpose  of
  federal   income   tax   reporting   for  the  total  operation  of  his
  establishment, and shall include, without limitation,  labor,  including
  salaries  of executives and officers, rent, depreciation, selling costs,
  maintenance of equipment, delivery costs, interest payable, all types of
  licenses, taxes, insurance and advertising expressed as a percentage and
  applied to the basic cost of cigarettes, plus the cost of doing business
  by the agent with respect to sales of cigarettes to retail dealers.  Any
  fractional  part  of a cent in the cost to the retail dealer per package
  or per carton shall be rounded off to the next higher cent.
    (B) In the absence of the filing with the commissioner of taxation and
  finance of satisfactory proof of a lesser cost of doing business by  the
  retail  dealer making the sale, the cost of doing business by the retail
  dealer shall be presumed to be seven per centum of the sum of the  basic
  cost  of  cigarettes  plus  the cost of doing business by the agent with
  respect to cigarettes sold to retail dealers.




   §  484.  Unlawful acts; violations of article. (a) Notwithstanding any
  other provision of law, it shall be unlawful and  a  violation  of  this

    (B) to induce or attempt to induce or to procure or attempt to procure

    (B) to induce or attempt to induce or to procure or attempt to procure
  any rebate or concession of any kind or nature whatsoever in  connection
  with the purchase of cigarettes.
    5.  (A)  Upon  a  first  violation  of  any  of the provisions of this
  article,  after  due  notice  and  opportunity  for   a   hearing,   the
  commissioner  may  suspend  the license of any agent or wholesale dealer
  for a period of not more than thirty days or impose a civil fine not  to
  exceed twenty thousand dollars or both such suspension and fine.
    (B) Upon a second or subsequent violation committed within three years
  following a prior finding of violation, after due notice and opportunity
  for a hearing, the commissioner shall revoke the license of any agent or

  was a fine only; or (ii) the commissioner determines, on  a  showing  by
  the  agent  or wholesale dealer, that the second or subsequent violation
  is due to reasonable cause or that such agent or wholesale dealer  acted

  for a period of not more than sixty days or impose a civil fine  not  to
  exceed fifty thousand dollars or both such suspension and fine.
    (C)  In  determining  whether to suspend or revoke or in assessing the
  amount of any fine under this paragraph the commissioner shall give  due
  consideration  to  the gravity of the violation, the size of the agent's
  or wholesale dealer's business, the amount of the sale in  violation  of
  this  article  below  the  minimum  markup  and  the history of previous
  violations. The penalties  provided  for  in  this  paragraph  shall  be
  determined,  assessed,  collected  and  paid  in  the manner provided in
  section four hundred seventy-eight of this chapter, as if such penalties
  were taxes imposed pursuant to this article.
    6. Evidence of advertisement, offering to sell or sale  of  cigarettes
  by  any  agent,  wholesale  dealer, chain store or retail dealer at less

  and to destroy or substantially lessen  competition,  or  of  intent  to
  avoid  the collection or paying over of such taxes as may be required by
  law.
    (b) 1. An action may be maintained in the supreme  court  to  prevent,
  restrain  or  enjoin a violation, or threatened violation, of any of the
  provisions of this article. Such an action  may  be  instituted  by  any
  person injured by any violation or threatened violation of this article,
  or  by  the  tax commission. If in such action a violation or threatened
  violation of this article shall be established, the court  shall  enjoin
  and  restrain,  or  otherwise  prohibit,  such  violation  or threatened
  violation. In such action it shall not be necessary that actual  damages
  to the plaintiff be alleged or proved, but where alleged and proved, the
  plaintiff  in  said  action,  in  addition to such injunctive relief and
  costs of suit, including reasonable attorney's fees, shall  be  entitled
  to  recover  from  the  defendant  the  actual damages sustained by such
  plaintiff.
    2. In the event that no injunctive relief is sought or  required,  any
  person injured by a violation of this article may maintain an action for
  damages  and  costs  of suit in the supreme court as provided for in the
  civil practice law and rules.
    (c) Any  contract,  expressed  or  implied,  made  by  any  person  in
  violation  of any of the provisions of this article is declared to be an
  illegal and void contract, and no recovery thereon shall be had.
    (d) The provisions of this article shall not be applicable to any sale
  as to which the tax imposed by section four hundred seventy-one of  this
  chapter  is not applicable or to a sale to the department of corrections
  and  community  supervision  of  this  state  for  sale  to  or  use  by
  incarcerated  individuals in institutions under the jurisdiction of such
  department.




   §  485.  Determination  of  cost  of agent, retail dealer or wholesale
  dealer. (a) 1. In determining "cost of the retail dealer", "cost of  the
  agent"  and "cost of the wholesale dealer" the tax commission or a court
  shall receive and consider as bearing on the bona fides  of  such  cost,
  evidence  tending  to show that any such person complained against under
  any of the provisions of this article purchased cigarettes, with respect
  to the sale of which complaint is made, at a fictitious price,  or  upon
  terms,  or  in  such a manner, or under such invoices, as to conceal the
  true costs, discounts or terms of purchase, and shall also  receive  and
  consider  as  bearing  on  the  bona fides of such cost, evidence of the
  normal, customary and prevailing terms and discounts in connection  with
  other sales of a similar nature in the trade area or state.
    2. Merchandise given gratis or payment made to an agent, retail dealer
  or  wholesale  dealer  by  the  manufacturer  thereof  for  display,  or
  advertising,  or  promotion  purposes,  or  otherwise,  shall   not   be
  considered  in  determining  the cost of cigarettes to the agent, retail
  dealer or wholesale dealer.
    (b) In all advertisements, offers for sale or sales involving  two  or
  more  items,  at  least  one of which items is cigarettes, at a combined
  price, and in all advertisements, offers for sale,  or  sales  involving
  the  giving of any gift or concession of any kind whatsoever (whether it
  be coupons or otherwise), the  agent's,  retail  dealer's  or  wholesale
  dealer's  combined  selling  price  shall  not  be below the cost of the
  agent, the cost of the retail  dealer  or  the  cost  of  the  wholesale
  dealer,  respectively,  of  the  total  costs of all articles, products,
  commodities, gifts and concessions included in such transactions.
    (c) When one wholesale dealer sells cigarettes to any other  wholesale
  dealer, the former shall not be required to include in his selling price
  to the latter, the cost of the wholesale dealer, as defined by paragraph
  two  of  subdivision  (b)  of  section four hundred eighty-three of this
  article, except that no such sale shall be made at a price less than the
  cost of the agent for sales to wholesale dealers as defined by paragraph
  one of subdivision (b) of section  four  hundred  eighty-three  of  this
  article,  but  the  latter  wholesale  dealer,  upon  resale to a retail
  dealer, shall be deemed to be  the  wholesale  dealer  governed  by  the
  provisions  of  paragraph two of subdivision (b) of section four hundred
  eighty-three of this article.
    (d) When one agent sells cigarettes to any  other  agent,  the  former
  shall not be required to include in his selling price to the latter, the
  cost  of  the  agent,  as defined by paragraph one of subdivision (b) of
  section four hundred eighty-three of this article, except that  no  such
  sale shall be made at a price less than the basic cost of cigarettes, as
  defined  by  paragraph  one  of  subdivision (a) of section four hundred
  eighty-three, but the latter agent,  upon  resale  of  such  cigarettes,
  shall be deemed to be the agent governed by paragraph one of subdivision
  (b)  of  section  four  hundred eighty-three of this article. Cigarettes
  sold by an agent to an agent must be picked up at the warehouse  of  the
  selling agent, or delivered to the warehouse of the purchasing agent.




   §  486. Exceptions. (a) The provisions of this article shall not apply
  to sales made:
    1. As an isolated transaction and not the usual course of business; or
    2. Where cigarettes are advertised, offered for sale, or sold  by  any
  fiduciary  or  other  officer acting under the order or direction of any
  court.
    (b) 1. Any retail  dealer  may  advertise,  offer  to  sell,  or  sell
  cigarettes  at  a  price  made  in  good  faith  to  meet the price of a
  competitor who is selling the same article at cost to him  as  a  retail
  dealer.  Any  agent  or wholesale dealer may advertise, offer to sell or
  sell cigarettes at a price made in good faith to meet  the  price  of  a
  competitor who is rendering the same type of services and is selling the
  same article at cost to him as an agent or as a wholesale dealer, as the
  case  may be.   The price of cigarettes advertised, offered for sale, or
  sold under the exceptions specified in subdivision (a) of  this  section
  shall  not be considered the price of a competitor and shall not be used
  as a basis for establishing prices  below  cost,  nor  shall  the  price
  established at a bankruptcy sale be considered the price of a competitor
  within the purview of this section.
    2.  In  the absence of proof of the price of a competitor, the cost of
  the retail dealer or the cost of the agent or wholesale dealer,  as  the
  case  may  be,  which  is  established  pursuant to section four hundred
  eighty-three of this article, may be deemed the price  of  a  competitor
  within the meaning of this section.
    (c) In establishing the cost of cigarettes of the retail dealer, agent
  or  wholesale  dealer, the invoice cost of said cigarettes purchase at a
  forced bankruptcy, or closeout  sale,  or  other  sale  outside  of  the
  ordinary  channels of trade, may not be used as a basis for justifying a
  price lower than one based upon the replacement cost of  the  cigarettes
  to  the  retail  dealer,  agent or wholesale dealer in the quantity last
  purchased through the ordinary channels of trade.




   §  487.  Secrecy  requirement.  (a)  Except  in accordance with proper
  judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for
  the tax commission, any tax commissioner, any officer or employee of the
  department of taxation and finance, any person engaged  or  retained  by
  such  department  on  an independent contract basis, or any person, who,
  pursuant to this section, is permitted to inspect any costs or to whom a
  copy, an abstract or a portion thereof is furnished, or to whom any such
  information is furnished or any person who in  any  manner  may  acquire
  knowledge  of  such costs, to divulge or make known in any manner any of
  the costs of doing business of a  retail  dealer,  or  of  an  agent  or
  wholesale  dealer which have been filed with the tax commission pursuant
  to paragraph one, two or  three  of  subdivision  (b)  of  section  four
  hundred  eighty-three  of  this  article,  or to divulge the name of any
  person who has provided information to the tax commission concerning any
  alleged violation of this article.
    (b) The officers and  employees  charged  with  the  custody  of  such
  information  shall not be required to divulge any of such information in
  any action or proceeding in any court,  except  on  behalf  of  the  tax
  commission  in  an  action  or  proceeding  under the provisions of this
  chapter or in any other action or proceeding involving the collection of
  a tax due under this chapter to which the state or the tax commission is
  a party or a claimant, or on behalf  of  any  party  to  any  action  or
  proceeding under the provisions of this article when such information is
  directly  involved  in such action or proceeding, in any of which events
  the court may require the production of, and may admit in  evidence,  so
  much  of  such  information as is pertinent to the action or proceeding,
  and no more.
    (c) This provision shall not be construed to prohibit  the  disclosure
  of  such  information  to  a  retail  dealer or to an agent or wholesale
  dealer, or to its duly authorized representative, in connection with its
  establishment  of  a  cost  of  doing  business,  or  to  prohibit   the
  publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification
  of  particular  information concerning the cost of doing business of any
  retail dealer, agent or wholesale  dealer,  or  the  disclosure  of  the
  identity   of  persons  licensed  as  agents  or  wholesale  dealers  or
  registered as chain stores, franchisees, cooperative  members  or  large
  volume outlets, or the disclosure to the attorney general or other legal
  representatives of the state in connection with any action or proceeding
  under  this  article  brought  by or against the retail dealer, agent or
  wholesale dealer, or against whom an action  or  proceeding  under  this
  chapter has been recommended by the commissioner of taxation and finance
  or by the attorney general.
    (d)  Any  officer  or employee of the state who willfully violates the
  provisions of this  section  shall  be  dismissed  from  office  and  be
  incapable  of  holding  any  public office in this state for a period of
  five years thereafter.
    (e) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see article  thirty-seven
  of this chapter.




   §  488. Joint administration. In addition to the powers granted to the
  tax commission in this chapter, the commission is hereby  authorized  to
  make  provisions  pursuant  to  rules  and  regulations  for  the  joint
  administration, in whole or in part,  of  the  tax  imposed  by  article
  twenty  and  article  twenty-A  of  this  chapter,  including  the joint
  reporting of information, and for that purpose to prescribe that any  of
  the  commission's functions under such articles, and any returns, forms,
  statements, documents or information to be submitted to  the  commission
  under  such  articles,  any books and records to be kept for purposes of
  such articles, or any license under such articles shall be  on  a  joint
  basis.




   §  489.  Registration  of  chain  stores. Every chain store, including
  vending machine operators, cooperative members,  franchisees  and  large
  volume outlet operators, must register with the commissioner of taxation
  and  finance.  The  fee  for  such  registration  shall be three hundred
  dollars, unless such fee has  been  paid  during  the  preceding  twelve
  months,  in  which  case,  the  fee  for  such registration shall be two
  hundred dollars. The fee for registration of a chain store  which  is  a
  vending machine operator which sells cigarettes at not less than fifteen
  separate  outlets  shall be two hundred fifty dollars, regardless of the
  number of vending machines owned or operated, or the number of  separate
  outlets  maintained,  unless such fee has been paid during the preceding
  twelve months, in which case, the fee for such registration shall be two
  hundred dollars. The commissioner may require all chain stores to file a
  new registration statement not more often than once every  three  years.
  Registration   statements   shall   contain   such  information  as  the
  commissioner may require by regulation or instruction.   The  provisions
  of  section four hundred eighty of this chapter relating to licensing of
  wholesale dealers shall be  applicable  to  the  registration  of  chain
  stores,  to  the  extent  that such provisions can be made applicable to
  such  registrations,  as  if  such  provisions  expressly  referred   to
  registration of chain stores.




   * §  490.  Excise tax on medical cannabis. 1. (a) For purposes of this
  article,  the  terms  "medical  cannabis,"  "registered   organization,"
  "certified  patient,"  and  "designated  caregiver"  shall have the same
  definitions as in section three of the cannabis law.
    (b) As used in this section, where not otherwise specifically  defined
  and unless a different meaning is clearly required "gross receipt" means
  the  amount  received  in  or  by  reason  of  any  sale, conditional or
  otherwise, of medical cannabis or in or by reason of the  furnishing  of
  medical  cannabis  from  the  sale  of  medical  cannabis  provided by a
  registered organization to a certified patient or designated  caregiver.
  Gross  receipt  is  expressed  in money, whether paid in cash, credit or
  property of any kind or nature, and  shall  be  determined  without  any
  deduction  therefrom  on  account of the cost of the service sold or the
  cost of materials, labor or services used or other  costs,  interest  or
  discount  paid,  or any other expenses whatsoever. "Amount received" for
  the purpose of the definition  of  gross  receipt,  as  the  term  gross
  receipt  is  used  throughout this article, means the amount charged for
  the provision of medical cannabis.
    2. There is hereby imposed an excise tax on the  gross  receipts  from
  the sale of medical cannabis by a registered organization to a certified
  patient   or   designated  caregiver,  to  be  paid  by  the  registered
  organization, at the rate of seven percent.  The  tax  imposed  by  this
  article  shall  be  charged  against  and  be  paid  by  the  registered
  organization and shall not be added as a separate charge or line item on
  any sales slip, invoice, receipt or other statement or memorandum of the
  price given to the retail customer.
    3. The commissioner may make,  adopt  and  amend  rules,  regulations,
  procedures  and  forms  necessary  for the proper administration of this
  article.
    4. Every registered organization that makes sales of medical  cannabis
  subject  to  the  tax  imposed  by  this article shall, on or before the
  twentieth date of each month, file with the  commissioner  a  return  on
  forms  to  be  prescribed by the commissioner, showing its receipts from
  the retail sale of medical cannabis during the preceding calendar  month
  and  the  amount  of  tax  due  thereon. Such returns shall contain such
  further information as the commissioner may  require.  Every  registered
  organization  required to file a return under this section shall, at the
  time of filing such return, pay to the commissioner the total amount  of
  tax  due  on its retail sales of medical cannabis for the period covered
  by such return. If a return is not filed when due, the tax shall be  due
  on the day on which the return is required to be filed.
    5.  Whenever the commissioner shall determine that any moneys received
  under the provisions of this article were paid in error,  he  may  cause
  the  same  to  be refunded, with interest, in accordance with such rules
  and regulations as he may prescribe, except that no  interest  shall  be
  allowed  or  paid  if  the amount thereof would be less than one dollar.
  Such interest shall be at the overpayment rate set by  the  commissioner
  pursuant  to subdivision twenty-sixth of section one hundred seventy-one
  of this chapter, or if no rate is set, at the rate of  six  percent  per
  annum,  from  the  date when the tax, penalty or interest to be refunded
  was paid to a date preceding the date of the refund check  by  not  more
  than  thirty  days.  Provided,  however,  that  for the purposes of this
  subdivision, any tax paid before the last day prescribed for its payment
  shall be deemed to have been paid on such last day. Such moneys received
  under the provisions  of  this  article  which  the  commissioner  shall
  determine  were  paid  in  error,  may  be  refunded out of funds in the
  custody of the comptroller to the  credit  of  such  taxes  provided  an


 application  therefor  is  filed  with the commissioner within two years
  from the time the erroneous payment was made.
    6.  The provisions of article twenty-seven of this chapter shall apply
  to the tax imposed by this article in the same manner and with the  same
  force   and  effect  as  if  the  language  of  such  article  had  been

  judicial order or as in this section or otherwise provided  by  law,  it
  shall  be  unlawful for the commissioner, any officer or employee of the
  department, or any officer or person who, pursuant to this  section,  is
  permitted to inspect any return or report or to whom a copy, an abstract
  or  a  portion  of  any  return  or  report is furnished, or to whom any
  information contained in any return  or  report  is  furnished,  or  any
  person engaged or retained by such department on an independent contract
  basis  or  any  person  who  in  any manner may acquire knowledge of the
  contents of a return or report filed pursuant to this article to divulge
  or make known in any  manner  the  contents  or  any  other  information
  relating  to  the  business  of  a  distributor,  owner  or other person
  contained in any return or  report  required  under  this  article.  The
  officers  charged  with the custody of such returns or reports shall not
  be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained  in
  them  in  any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the
  state, office of cannabis management, or the commissioner in  an  action
  or  proceeding  under the provisions of this chapter or on behalf of the
  state or the commissioner in any other action  or  proceeding  involving
  the collection of a tax due under this chapter to which the state or the
  commissioner  is  a party or a claimant or on behalf of any party to any
  action or proceeding under the provisions  of  this  article,  when  the
  returns  or the reports or the facts shown thereby are directly involved
  in such action or proceeding, or in an action or proceeding relating  to
  the  regulation or taxation of medical cannabis on behalf of officers to
  whom information shall have been supplied as provided in subdivision two
  of this section, in any of  which  events  the  court  may  require  the
  production  of,  and  may  admit  in evidence so much of said returns or
  reports or of the facts shown thereby as are pertinent to the action  or
  proceeding  and  no  more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit
  the commissioner, in his or her discretion, from allowing the inspection
  or delivery of a certified copy of any return or report filed under this
  article or of any information contained in any such return or report  by
  or  to  a  duly authorized officer or employee of the office of cannabis
  management;  or  by  or  to  the  attorney  general   or   other   legal
  representatives  of the state when an action shall have been recommended
  or commenced pursuant to this chapter in which such returns  or  reports
  or  the  facts shown thereby are directly involved; or the inspection of
  the returns or reports required under this article by the comptroller or
  duly designated officer or employee of the state department of audit and
  control, for purposes of the audit of a refund of  any  tax  paid  by  a
  registered  organization  or  other  person  under  this article; nor to
  prohibit the delivery to a registered organization, or a duly authorized
  representative of such registered organization, a certified copy of  any
  return  or report filed by such registered organization pursuant to this
  article, nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified  as
  to  prevent  the identification of particular returns or reports and the
  items thereof. This section shall also not be construed to prohibit  the
  disclosure,  for  tax  administration  purposes,  to the division of the
  budget  and  the  office  of  the  state  comptroller,  of   information
  aggregated  from  the  returns filed by all the registered organizations
  making sales of, or  manufacturing,  medical  cannabis  in  a  specified
  county,  whether  the  number of such registered organizations is one or
  more. Provided further that,  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  this
  subdivision,  the commissioner may, in his or her discretion, permit the
  proper  officer  of  any  county  entitled  to  receive  an  allocation,
  following appropriation by the legislature, pursuant to this article and
  section  eighty-nine-h  of  the  state  finance  law,  or the authorized


 representative of such officer, to inspect any return filed  under  this
  article,  or  may  furnish  to  such officer or the officer's authorized
  representative an abstract of any such return or supply such officer  or
  such representative with information concerning an item contained in any
  such  return,  or  disclosed by any investigation of tax liability under
  this article.
    2. The commissioner, in his or her discretion  and  pursuant  to  such
  rules and regulations as he or she may adopt, may permit the appropriate
  officers  of  any other state which regulates or taxes medical cannabis,
  or the duly authorized representatives  of  such  officers,  to  inspect
  returns or reports made pursuant to this article, or may furnish to such
  other  officers,  or duly authorized representatives, a copy of any such
  return or report or an abstract of the information therein contained, or
  any  portion  thereof,  or  may  supply  any  such  officers   or   such
  representatives   with   information  relating  to  the  business  of  a
  registered  organization  making  returns  or  reports  hereunder.   The
  commissioner   may   refuse  to  supply  information  pursuant  to  this
  subdivision to the officers of any other state if the  statutes  of  the
  state  represented  by such officers, do not grant substantially similar
  privileges to the commissioner, but such refusal shall not be mandatory.
  Information shall not be supplied to the  appropriate  officers  of  any
  other  state  which  regulates  or  taxes  medical cannabis, or the duly
  authorized representatives of any of such officers, unless such  officer
  or other representatives shall agree not to divulge or make known in any
  manner  the information so supplied, but such officers may transmit such
  information to their employees or legal representatives when  necessary,
  who  in  turn  shall be subject to the same restrictions as those hereby
  imposed upon such officer or other representatives.
    3. (a) Any officer or employee of the state who willfully violates the
  provisions of subdivision one or two of this section shall be  dismissed
  from  office and be incapable of holding any public office in this state

  for the tax, and such tax shall accrue at the time of the retail sale.
    (b) In addition to any other tax imposed by this chapter or other law,

  accrue at the time of such sale or transfer.
    (c) In addition to the taxes imposed by subdivisions (a)  and  (b)  of
  this  section,  there is hereby imposed a tax on the sale or transfer of

  tax  shall  accrue at the time of such sale or transfer. The tax imposed
  by this subdivision is imposed on a person who sells adult-use  cannabis
  products  at  retail, and shall be paid to the commissioner in trust for
  and on account of a city having a population of a million or  more,  and
  counties  (other  than  counties  wholly  within  such  a  city), towns,
  villages, and cities with a population of less than a million in which a
  retail dispensary is located.
    (d) The taxes imposed by this section shall  not  apply  to  sales  of
  adult-use cannabis to a person holding a cannabis research license under
  section thirty-nine of the cannabis law.




   § 494. Registration and renewal. (a) (1) Every distributor on whom tax
  is  imposed  under  this  article  and  every person who sells adult-use
  cannabis products at retail must file with the commissioner  a  properly
  completed  application for a certificate of registration and obtain such
  certificate before engaging in business, provided, however, this section
  shall  not  apply  to  a  natural  person  engaged  in  lawful  activity
  pertaining  to  personal use or personal cultivation pursuant to article
  two  hundred  twenty-two  of  the  penal  law.  An  application  for   a
  certificate  of registration must be submitted electronically, on a form
  prescribed  by  the  commissioner,  and  must  be   accompanied   by   a
  non-refundable  application fee of six hundred dollars. A certificate of
  registration shall not  be  assignable  or  transferable  and  shall  be
  destroyed  immediately  upon  such  person  ceasing  to  do  business as
  specified in such certificate, or in the event that such business  never
  commenced.
    (2) Provided, however, that the commissioner shall refund or credit an
  application  fee  paid  with respect to the registration of an adult-use
  cannabis business in this state if, prior to the beginning of the period
  with respect to which such  registration  relates,  the  certificate  of
  registration  described in paragraph one of this subdivision is returned
  to the department or,  if  such  certificate  has  been  destroyed,  the
  operator  of  such  business satisfactorily accounts to the commissioner
  for the missing certificate, but such business may  not  sell  adult-use
  cannabis  products  in  this  state  during  such  period,  unless it is
  re-registered. Such refund or credit shall be deemed  a  refund  of  tax
  paid  in  error, provided, however, no interest shall be allowed or paid
  on any such refund.
    (b) (1) The commissioner  shall  refuse  to  issue  a  certificate  of
  registration  to  any  applicant  and  shall  revoke  the certificate of
  registration of any such person who does not  possess  a  valid  license
  from the office of cannabis management.
    (2) The commissioner may refuse to issue a certificate of registration
  to any applicant where such applicant:
    (i)  has  a  past-due liability as that term is defined in section one
  hundred seventy-one-v of this chapter;
    (ii) has had a certificate  of  registration  under  this  article,  a
  license  from  the  office  of  cannabis  management,  or any license or
  registration provided for in this chapter  revoked  or  suspended  where
  such  revocation or suspension was in effect on the date the application
  was filed or  ended  within  one  year  from  the  date  on  which  such
  application was filed;
    (iii)  has  been  convicted  of  a  crime provided for in this chapter
  within one year from the date on which such application was filed or the
  certificate was issued, as applicable;
    (iv) willfully fails to file a  report  or  return  required  by  this
  article;
    (v) willfully files, causes to be filed, gives or causes to be given a
  report,  return, certificate or affidavit required by this article which
  is false;
    (vi) willfully fails to collect or truthfully account for or pay  over
  any tax imposed by this article;
    (vii)  has  been  determined to have possessed illicit cannabis within
  one year from the date on which such application was filed;
    (viii) is a distributor that has been  determined  to  have  knowingly
  sold  adult-use  cannabis  products  to  any  person who sells adult-use
  cannabis products at  retail  and  who  is  not  registered  under  this
  section, or whose registration has been suspended or revoked; or


   (ix)  has  a  place  of  business  at  the  same premises as that of a
  distributor upon whom tax is imposed under this article, or  person  who
  sells adult-use cannabis products at retail, whose registration has been
  revoked  and  where  such  revocation  is  still  in  effect, unless the
  applicant   provides   the   commissioner  with  adequate  documentation
  demonstrating that such applicant  acquired  the  premises  or  business
  through  an  arm's  length  transaction  as  defined in paragraph (e) of
  subdivision one of section four hundred eighty-a  of  this  chapter  and
  that  the  sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the
  purpose of permitting the original registrant to avoid the effect of the
  previous revocation for the same premises.
    (3) The commissioner may revoke the certificate of registration issued
  to any person who:
    (i) has had any license or registration provided for in  this  chapter
  revoked or suspended;
    (ii)  has been convicted of a crime provided for in this chapter where
  such conviction occurred not more than one year prior  to  the  date  of
  revocation;
    (iii)  willfully  fails  to  file  a report or return required by this
  article;
    (iv) willfully files, causes to be filed, gives or causes to be  given
  a  report,  return,  certificate  or  affidavit required by this article
  which is false;
    (v) willfully fails to collect or truthfully account for or  pay  over
  any tax imposed by this article; or
    (vi)  is a distributor that has been determined to have knowingly sold
  adult-use cannabis products to any person who sells  adult-use  cannabis
  products  at  retail  and  who  is not registered under this section, or
  whose registration has been suspended or revoked.
    (4) In addition to the grounds for  revocation  in  this  subdivision,
  where  a person who holds a certificate of registration is determined to
  have possessed or sold illicit cannabis:
    (1) such registration may be revoked (i) for a period  of  up  to  one
  year for the first such possession or sale by such person;
    (ii) for a period of up to three years for a second such possession or
  sale within a period of five years by such person; and
    (iii)  for a period of up to five years for a third such possession or
  sale within a period of five years by  such  person.  A  certificate  of
  registration  may be revoked pursuant to this paragraph immediately upon
  such  person's  receipt  of  written  notice  of  revocation  from   the
  commissioner.
    A  person  who  is  notified  of  a revocation of their certificate of
  registration pursuant to this paragraph shall have the right to have the
  revocation reviewed by the commissioner or their designee by  contacting
  the  department  at  a telephone number or an address to be disclosed in
  the notice of revocation within ten days of  such  person's  receipt  of
  such  notification. Such person may present written evidence or argument
  in support of their defense  to  the  revocation  or  may  appear  at  a
  scheduled  conference with the commissioner or their designee to present
  oral arguments and written and oral evidence in support of such defense.
  The commissioner or their designee is authorized to delay the  effective
  date of the revocation to enable such person to present further evidence
  or  arguments  in  connection  with  the revocation. The commissioner or
  their designee  shall  cancel  the  revocation  of  the  certificate  of
  registration if the commissioner or their designee is not satisfied by a
  preponderance  of  the  evidence that a basis for revocation pursuant to
  this paragraph exists. An  order  of  revocation  of  a  certificate  of
  registration  under  this  paragraph  shall  not  be  reviewable  by the


 division of  tax  appeals  but  may  be  reviewed  pursuant  to  article
  seventy-eight  of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules by a proceeding
  commenced in the supreme court within  four  months  of  the  revocation
  petitioning  that the order of revocation be enjoined or set aside. Such
  proceeding shall be instituted in the county where the commissioner  has
  their principal office. Upon the filing of such petition the court shall
  have  jurisdiction to set aside such order of revocation, in whole or in
  part, or to dismiss the petition. The jurisdiction of the supreme  court
  shall be exclusive and its order dismissing the petition or enjoining or
  setting  aside  such order, in whole or in part, shall be final, subject
  to review by the appellate division of the supreme court and  the  court
  of  appeals  in  the  same  manner  and form and with the same effect as
  provided by law for appeals from a judgment in a special proceeding. All
  such proceedings shall be heard and determined by the court and  by  any
  appellate  court as expeditiously as possible and with lawful precedence
  over other civil matters. All such proceedings for review shall be heard
  on the petition, transcript and other papers, and  on  appeal  shall  be
  heard on the record, without requirement of printing.
    (c) Where a person that does not possess a certificate of registration
  under  this  section  has  been determined to have possessed or sold any
  adult-use cannabis product or illicit cannabis:
    (1) The commissioner may revoke a certificate of authority  issued  to
  such  person  pursuant  to  section  eleven  hundred thirty-four of this
  chapter for a place of business where such person has been determined to
  have possessed for sale or to have sold adult-use  cannabis  product  or
  illicit  cannabis  three  or  more  times  within a period of five years
  without a certificate of registration.
    (2) The commissioner may refuse to issue a  certificate  of  authority
  under   section   eleven  hundred  thirty-four  of  this  chapter  to  a
  distributor upon whom tax is imposed under this article, or a person who
  sells adult-use cannabis products at retail, who has a place of business
  at the same premises as that of a person whose certificate of  authority
  has been revoked pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision and where
  such  revocation  is  still in effect, unless the applicant provides the
  commissioner  with  adequate  documentation  demonstrating   that   such
  applicant  acquired  the  premises  or  business through an arm's length
  transaction as defined in paragraph (e) of subdivision  one  of  section
  four hundred eighty-a of this chapter and that the sale or lease was not
  conducted,  in  whole  or  in  part,  for  the purpose of permitting the
  original registrant to avoid the effect of the previous  revocation  for
  the same premises.
    (d)  A  certificate  of  registration  shall  be  valid for the period
  specified  thereon,  unless  earlier  suspended  or  revoked.  Upon  the
  expiration  of  the  term  stated on a certificate of registration, such
  certificate shall be null and void.
    (e) Every holder of a certificate  of  registration  must  notify  the
  commissioner  of  changes  to  any  of  the  information  stated  on the
  certificate,  or  of  changes  to  any  information  contained  in   the
  application  for the certificate of registration. Such notification must
  be made on or before the last day of the month in which a change  occurs
  and   must   be   made  electronically  on  a  form  prescribed  by  the
  commissioner.
    (f) Every holder of a certificate of registration under  this  article
  shall  be  required  to  reapply prior to such certificate's expiration,
  during a reapplication period  established  by  the  commissioner.  Such
  reapplication  period  shall  not  occur  more frequently than every two
  years. Such reapplication shall be subject to the same requirements  and


 conditions  as an initial application, including grounds for refusal and
  the payment of the application fee.
    (g) Any person who is required to obtain a certificate of registration
  under  subdivision  (a) of this section who possesses adult-use cannabis
  products without such certificate shall be subject to a penalty of up to
  seven thousand five hundred dollars for a  first  violation  and  up  to
  fifteen  thousand  dollars  for  a second or subsequent violation within
  three years following a prior violation.  Any  such  adult-use  cannabis
  product shall be subject to immediate forfeiture to, and seizure by, the
  commissioner  or  their  duly  authorized  representatives,  or the duly
  authorized representatives of the office of cannabis management.
    (h) No distributor on whom tax is imposed  under  this  article  shall
  sell  any  adult-use  cannabis product to any person who sells adult-use
  cannabis products at  retail  and  who  is  not  registered  under  this
  section, or whose registration has been suspended or revoked.




   §  495.  Returns  and  payment of tax. (a) Every person on whom tax is
  imposed under this article shall, on or before the twentieth day of  the
  month  following  each  quarterly  period  ending  on  the  last  day of
  February, May, August, and November, respectively,  file  electronically
  with  the  commissioner  a  return  on  forms  to  be  prescribed by the
  commissioner, showing the total amount of  tax  due  in  such  quarterly
  period,  and  including  such  other information as the commissioner may
  require.
    (b) Every person required to file a return under this  section  shall,
  at   the   time  of  filing  such  return,  pay  electronically  to  the
  commissioner the total amount of tax due for the period covered by  such
  return.  If  a return is not filed when due, the tax shall be due on the
  day on which the return is required to be filed.




   §  496.  Records  to be kept; penalties. (a) Records to be kept. Every
  distributor on whom tax is imposed under this article and  every  person
  who  sells adult-use cannabis products at retail shall maintain complete
  and accurate records in  such  form  as  the  commissioner  may  require
  including,  but  not  limited to, such items as the total THC content of
  the adult-use cannabis products sold to  or  produced  by  such  person;
  complete  records  of  every  retail sale of adult-use cannabis, and any
  other record or information required by the commissioner.  Such  records
  must  be  preserved  for a period of three years after the filing of the
  return to which  such  records  relate  and  must  be  provided  to  the
  commissioner upon request.
    (b)  Penalties.  In  addition  to  any  other penalty provided in this
  article or otherwise imposed by law, every distributor on  whom  tax  is
  imposed under this article and every person who sells adult-use cannabis
  products  at  retail  who  fails  to  maintain  or make available to the
  commissioner the records required  by  this  section  is  subject  to  a
  penalty  not  to  exceed  five  hundred  dollars  for each month or part
  thereof for which the failure occurs. This penalty may  not  be  imposed
  more than once for failures for the same monthly period or part thereof.
  If  the  commissioner  determines  that  a  failure  to maintain or make
  available records in any month was entirely due to reasonable cause  and
  not to willful neglect, the commissioner must remit the penalty for that
  month.
    (c) The failure of any person who sells adult-use cannabis products at
  retail,  except  a  person who possesses a valid registered organization
  adult-use cultivator processor distributor retail dispensary license  or
  microbusiness  license  issued  by the office of cannabis management, to
  comply with subdivision (a) of this section for the  adult-use  cannabis
  products  in such person's possession shall be presumptive evidence that
  the tax thereon has not been paid, and that such person shall be  liable
  for  the  tax  thereon  unless  evidence  of  such  invoice,  payment or
  assumption shall later be produced.




   §  496-a.  Returns  to be secret. (a) Except in accordance with proper
  judicial order or as in this section or otherwise provided  by  law,  it
  shall  be  unlawful for the commissioner, any officer or employee of the
  department, or any officer or person who, pursuant to this  section,  is
  permitted to inspect any return or report or to whom a copy, an abstract
  or  a  portion  of  any  return  or  report is furnished, or to whom any
  information contained in any return  or  report  is  furnished,  or  any
  person  who  in  any  manner  may acquire knowledge of the contents of a
  return or report filed pursuant to this article to divulge or make known
  in any manner the content or any  other  information  contained  in  any
  return  or report required under this article. The officers charged with
  the custody of such returns or reports shall not be required to  produce
  any  of  them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or
  preceding in any court, except on behalf of the  state,  the  office  of
  cannabis  management,  or  the  commissioner  in an action or proceeding
  involving the collection of tax due under  this  chapter  to  which  the
  state  or  the commissioner is a party or a claimant or on behalf of any
  party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this  article,
  when  the returns or the reports or the facts shown thereby are directly
  involved in such action or proceeding, or in  an  action  or  proceeding
  related  to the regulation or taxation of adult-use cannabis products on
  behalf of officers to whom  information  shall  have  been  supplied  as
  provided  in  this section, in any of which events the court may require
  the production of, and may admit in evidence so much of said returns  or
  reports  or of the facts shown thereby as are pertinent to the action or
  proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall be  construed  to  prohibit
  the commissioner, in his or her discretion, from allowing the inspection
  or delivery of a certified copy of any return or report filed under this
  article  or of any information contained in any such return or report by
  or to a duly authorized officer or employee of the  office  of  cannabis
  management;   or   by   or  to  the  attorney  general  or  other  legal
  representatives of the state when an action shall have been  recommended
  or  commenced  pursuant to this chapter in which such returns or reports
  or the facts shown thereby are directly involved; or the  inspection  of
  the returns or reports required under this article by the comptroller or
  duly designated officer or employee of the state department of audit and
  control,  for  purposes  of the audit of a refund of any tax paid by any
  person under this article; nor to prohibit the delivery to  such  person
  or  a duly authorized representative of such person, a certified copy of
  any return or report filed by such person pursuant to this article,  nor
  to  prohibit  the  publication of statistics so classified as to prevent
  the identification of  particular  returns  or  reports  and  the  items
  thereof.  This  section  shall  also  not  be  construed to prohibit the
  disclosure, for tax administration purposes,  to  the  division  of  the
  budget   and  the  office  of  the  state  comptroller,  of  information
  aggregated from the returns filed by all persons subject  to  the  taxes
  imposed  by  the  article,  whether the number of such persons is one or
  more. Provided further that,  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  this
  subdivision,  the commissioner may, in his or her discretion, permit the
  proper officer of any county entitled to receive any distribution of the
  monies received on account of the tax  imposed  by  subdivision  (c)  of
  section  four  hundred  ninety-three  of this article, or the authorized
  representative of such officer, to inspect any return filed  under  this
  article,  or  may  furnish  to  such officer or the officer's authorized
  representative an abstract of any such return or supply such officer  or
  representative with information concerning an item contained in any such
  return,  or  disclosed  by any investigation of tax liability under this
  article.


   (b) The commissioner,  in  his  or  her  discretion,  may  permit  the
  appropriate officers of any other state that regulates or taxes cannabis
  or  the duly authorized representatives of any such officers, to inspect
  returns or reports made pursuant to this article, or may furnish to such
  other  officers, or their duly authorized representatives, a copy of any
  such return  or  report  or  an  abstract  of  the  information  therein
  contained,  or  any  portion thereof, or may supply any such officers or
  such representatives with information relating  to  the  business  of  a
  person  making  returns  or reports hereunder solely for purposes of tax
  administration.  The  commissioner  may  refuse  to  supply  information
  pursuant  to  this subdivision to the officers of any other state if the
  statutes of  the  state  represented  by  such  officers  do  not  grant
  substantially  similar  privileges to the commissioner, but such refusal
  shall not be  mandatory.  Information  shall  not  be  supplied  to  the
  officers  of  any  state that regulates or taxes cannabis, or their duly
  authorized representatives of any such officers, unless such officer  or
  other  representatives  shall  agree not to divulge or make known in any
  manner the information so supplied, but such officers may transmit  such
  information  to their employees or legal representatives when necessary,
  who in turn shall be subject to the same restrictions  as  those  hereby
  imposed upon such officer or other representatives.
    (c)(1) Any officer or employee of the state who willfully violates the
  provisions  of subdivision (a) or (b) of this section shall be dismissed
  from office and be incapable of holding any public office in this  state
  for a period of five years thereafter.
    (2) For criminal penalties, see article thirty-seven of this chapter.




   §  496-b.  Administrative  provisions.  (a)  The provisions of article
  twenty-seven of this chapter shall apply to the taxes imposed by section
  four hundred ninety-three of this article in the same  manner  and  with
  the  same  force  and effect as if the language of such article had been
  incorporated in full into this section and had expressly referred to the
  tax imposed by this article, except to the extent that any provision  of
  such  article is either inconsistent with a provision of this article or
  is not relevant to this article.
    (b)(1) All taxes, interest, and penalties collected or received by the
  commissioner under this article  shall  be  deposited  and  disposed  of
  pursuant  to the provisions of section one hundred seventy-one-a of this
  chapter, provided that an amount equal to one hundred percent  collected
  under  this article less any amount determined by the commissioner to be
  reserved by the comptroller for refunds or reimbursements shall be  paid
  by   the  comptroller  to  the  credit  of  the  cannabis  revenue  fund
  established by section ninety-nine-ii of the state finance law.  Of  the
  total  revenue collected or received under this article, the comptroller
  shall retain such  amount  as  the  commissioner  may  determine  to  be
  necessary  for  refunds.  The commissioner is authorized and directed to
  deduct from the registration fees under subdivision (a) of section  four
  hundred  ninety-four  of  this article, before deposit into the cannabis
  revenue  fund  designated  by  the  comptroller,  a  reasonable   amount
  necessary  to  effectuate refunds of appropriations of the department to
  reimburse the department for the costs incurred to administer,  collect,
  and distribute the taxes imposed by this article.
    (2)  All  taxes,  interest, and penalties collected or received by the
  commissioner under subdivision (c) of section four hundred  ninety-three
  of  this  article  shall  be  deposited  and disposed of pursuant to the
  provisions  of  section  one  hundred  seventy-one-a  of  this  chapter,
  provided  that  an  amount  equal to one hundred percent collected under
  such subdivision (c), less any amount determined by the commissioner  to
  be  reserved  by the comptroller for refunds or reimbursements, shall be
  paid to the comptroller  and  the  commissioner  shall  certify  to  the
  comptroller  the  amount of tax, penalties, and interest attributable to
  retail sales within a city with a population of a million  or  more  and
  counties (other than a county wholly within such city). Such amount will
  be  distributed  by the comptroller to such city and such counties. Such
  counties shall be entitled to retain twenty-five percent of  the  monies
  so   distributed.   Such   counties   shall   distribute  the  remaining
  seventy-five percent of such monies to the towns, villages,  and  cities
  within such county in which a retail dispensary is located in proportion
  to  the  sales of adult-use cannabis products by the retail dispensaries
  in such towns, villages and cities as reported by a seed-to-sale system,
  provided, however, where a retail dispensary is  located  in  a  village
  within  a  town  that both permit cannabis retail sales, then the county
  shall distribute the monies attributable to such  retail  dispensary  to
  such  town  and  village in such proportion as may be agreed upon by the
  elective governing body of such town and of  such  village  or,  in  the
  absence  of  such  an agreement, shall evenly divide such monies between
  such town  and  village.  Such  counties  shall  distribute  the  monies
  received  for  each  quarter  ending  on  the last day of February, May,
  August or November to such towns, villages and cities no later than  the
  thirtieth day after receipt of such monies from the comptroller.




   §  496-c.  Additional penalties. (a) In addition to any other civil or
  criminal penalties that may apply, any person knowingly in possession of
  or knowingly having control  over  any  type  of  illicit  cannabis,  as
  defined in section four hundred ninety-two of this article, after notice
  and an opportunity for a hearing, shall be liable for a civil penalty in
  an  amount  up  to  two times the amount of tax otherwise required to be
  paid for such product for  a  first  violation,  and  for  a  second  or
  subsequent  violation within three years following a prior violation may
  be liable for a civil penalty in an amount up to three times the  amount
  of tax otherwise required to be paid for such product.
    (b) In addition to any other penalty authorized by this chapter or any
  other law:
    (1)  Any  person  who  knowingly  possesses  for sale, as such term is
  defined in section four hundred ninety-two of this  article,  more  than
  five pounds but less than twelve pounds of illicit cannabis or more than
  one  pound but less than four pounds of illicit concentrated cannabis or
  illicit cannabis edible product, after notice and an opportunity  for  a
  hearing, may be liable for a civil penalty of up to twenty-five thousand
  dollars  for  a first violation and may be liable for a civil penalty of
  up to fifty thousand dollars for a second or subsequent violation within
  three years following a prior violation.
    (2) Any person who knowingly possesses  for  sale,  as  such  term  is
  defined  in section four hundred ninety-two of this article, over twelve
  or more pounds of illicit cannabis or four or  more  pounds  of  illicit
  concentrated  cannabis  or illicit cannabis edible product, after notice
  and an opportunity for a hearing, may be liable for a civil  penalty  of
  up  to  seventy-five  thousand  dollars for a first violation and may be
  liable for a civil penalty of up to one hundred thousand dollars  for  a
  second  or  subsequent  violation  within  three years following a prior
  violation.
    (3) In addition to any penalty imposed pursuant to paragraphs  one  or
  two of this subdivision, any person who knowingly possesses for sale, as
  such term is defined in section four hundred ninety-two of this article,
  more  than  five  pounds  of illicit cannabis, or more than one pound of
  illicit concentrated cannabis or illicit cannabis edible product,  in  a
  commercial  location, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, may
  be subject to an additional  civil  penalty  of  up  to  fifty  thousand
  dollars  for  a first violation and may be liable for a civil penalty of
  up to one hundred thousand dollars for a second or subsequent  violation
  within  three  years  following  a prior violation. For purposes of this
  paragraph, "commercial location" means real property or a  vehicle  held
  out  as  open to the public or otherwise being used to conduct wholesale
  or retail transactions, including a storage area in or adjacent to  such
  property  or  vehicle.  Such  term  shall  not  include a residence or a
  personally-owned vehicle located at such residence.
    (c) Any distributor on whom tax is imposed  under  this  article  that
  knowingly  sells  any adult-use cannabis product to any person who sells
  at retail adult-use  cannabis  products  who  is  not  registered  under
  section  four hundred ninety-four of this article, or whose registration
  has been suspended or revoked, may, after notice and an opportunity  for
  a hearing, be liable for a civil penalty of up to fifty thousand dollars
  for  a  first  violation  and  up  to one hundred thousand dollars for a
  second or subsequent violation within  three  years  following  a  prior
  violation.
    (d)  No enforcement action taken under this section shall be construed
  to limit any other criminal or civil liability of anyone  in  possession
  of illicit cannabis.


   (e)  The  penalties imposed by this section shall not apply to natural
  persons lawfully in possession of  adult-use  cannabis  or  concentrated
  cannabis  for personal use as provided in article two hundred twenty-two
  of the penal law.




   §  496-d.  Enforcement.  The  commissioner  or the commissioner's duly
  authorized representatives are hereby authorized:
    (a) To conduct regulatory inspections during normal business hours  of
  any place of business, including a vehicle used for such business, where
  adult-use  cannabis  products  are  distributed, placed, stored, sold or
  offered for sale. For the purposes of this section, "place of  business"
  shall  not  include  a residence or other real property, or any personal
  vehicle on or about such property, not held out as open to the public or
  otherwise being utilized in a  business  or  commercial  manner,  unless
  probable  cause  exists to believe that such residence, real property or
  vehicle is being used in such a business or commercial  manner  for  the
  buying or selling of adult-use cannabis products.
    (b)  To examine any adult-use cannabis products and the books, papers,
  invoices and other records of any place of  business  or  vehicle  where
  adult-use  cannabis  products  are  distributed, placed, stored, sold or
  offered for sale. Any person in possession, control or occupancy of  any
  such   business   is  required  to  give  to  the  commissioner  or  the
  commissioner's duly authorized representatives or  the  duly  authorized
  representatives  of  the  office  of  cannabis  management,  the  means,
  facilities, and opportunity for such examinations. For the  purposes  of
  this section, "place of business" shall not include a residence or other
  real  property,  or  any personal vehicle on or about such property, not
  held out as open to the public or otherwise being utilized in a business
  or commercial manner, unless probable cause exists to believe that  such
  residence,  real property or vehicle is being used in such a business or
  commercial manner for  the  buying  or  selling  of  adult-use  cannabis
  products.
    (c) If any person registered under section four hundred ninety-four of
  this  article, or their agents, refuses to give the commissioner, or the
  commissioner's duly authorized representatives,  the  means,  facilities
  and  opportunity  for  the inspections and examinations required by this
  section, the  commissioner,  after  notice  and  an  opportunity  for  a
  hearing,  may  revoke their registration to distribute or sell adult-use
  cannabis products at retail:
    (i) for a period of one year for the first such failure;
    (ii) for a period of up to three  years  for  a  second  such  failure
  within a period of three years; and
    (iii)  for  a  period  of  up  to seven years for a third such failure
  within five years.
    (d)  The  commissioner   or   the   commissioner's   duly   authorized
  representatives  shall  seize any illicit cannabis found in any place of
  business or vehicle where adult-use cannabis products  are  distributed,
  placed,  stored,  sold  or  offered  for sale by any person who does not
  possess a certificate of  registration  as  described  in  section  four
  hundred ninety-four of this chapter.
    (e)  All  illicit  cannabis  seized  pursuant to the authority of this
  chapter or any other law of this state  shall  be  turned  over  to  the
  office  of  cannabis management or their authorized representative. Such
  seized illicit cannabis shall, after notice and  an  opportunity  for  a
  hearing, be forfeited to the state. If the office of cannabis management
  determines  the  illicit  cannabis  cannot  be  used for law enforcement
  purposes, it may, within a reasonable time after the forfeiture of  such
  illicit  cannabis,  upon publication in the state registry, destroy such
  forfeited illicit cannabis.




   §  496-e.  Notification of enforcement actions. The commissioner shall
  notify the cannabis control board and the office of cannabis  management
  of  the commencement of any enforcement actions taken under this article
  as well as  the  conclusion,  outcomes,  and  the  amount  of  penalties
  collected as a result of such actions.




   §  497.  Definitions.  The  following  terms  shall have the following
  meanings when used in this article.
    (a)  "Opioid"  shall  mean  an  "opiate"  as  defined  by  subdivision
  twenty-three  of  section  thirty-three hundred two of the public health
  law and any natural, synthetic,  or  semisynthetic  "narcotic  drug"  as
  defined  by  subdivision  twenty-two  of  such section that has agonist,
  partial  agonist,  or  agonist/antagonist  morphine-like  activities  or
  effects   similar  to  natural  opium  alkaloids,  and  any  derivative,
  congener, or combination thereof listed in  schedules  II-V  of  section
  thirty-three  hundred  six  of  the public health law. The term "opioid"
  shall not mean buprenorphine, methadone, or morphine.
    (b) "Unit" shall mean a single finished dosage form of an opioid, such
  as a pill, tablet, capsule, suppository, transdermal patch, buccal film,
  milliliter of liquid, milligram of topical  preparation,  or  any  other
  form.
    (c)  "Strength per unit" shall mean the amount of opioid in a unit, as
  measured by weight, volume, concentration or other metric.
    (d) "Morphine milligram equivalent conversion factor" shall mean  that
  reference  standard  of  a particular opioid as it relates in potency to
  morphine as determined by the commissioner of health.
    (e) "Morphine milligram equivalent" shall mean a  unit  multiplied  by
  its  strength  per  unit multiplied by the morphine milligram equivalent
  conversion factor.
    (f) "Registrant" shall mean: (1)  any  person,  firm,  corporation  or
  association  that:  (i)  is required to be registered with the education
  department  as  a  wholesaler,  manufacturer,  or  outsourcing  facility
  pursuant  to  section  six  thousand  eight hundred eight or section six
  thousand eight hundred eight-b of the education law and (ii)  holds  and
  transfers  title to an opioid unit; (2) any person, firm, corporation or
  association that: (i) would  be  required  to  be  registered  with  the
  education  department  as  a  wholesaler,  manufacturer,  or outsourcing
  facility pursuant to such section six thousand eight hundred eight-b but
  for the exception in subdivision two of such section and (ii) holds  and
  transfers  title to an opioid unit; or (3) any person, firm, corporation
  or association that: (i) is required to be registered  with  the  health
  department  as  a  manufacturer or distributor of a controlled substance
  pursuant to section thirty-three hundred ten of the  public  health  law
  and (ii) holds and transfers title to an opioid unit.
    (g)  "Wholesale  acquisition  cost" shall mean the manufacturer's list
  price for an opioid unit to wholesalers  or  direct  purchasers  in  the
  United  States,  not including prompt pay or other discounts, rebates or
  reductions in price, for the most recent month for which the information
  is  available,  as  reported  in  wholesale  price   guides   or   other
  publications of drug or biological pricing data.
    (h)  "Sale"  shall  mean any transfer of title to an opioid unit for a
  consideration where actual or constructive  possession  of  such  opioid
  unit is transferred by a registrant holding title to such opioid unit to
  a  purchaser  or  its  designee  in this state. A sale shall not include
  either the dispensing of an opioid unit pursuant to a prescription to an
  ultimate consumer or the transfer of title to  an  opioid  unit  from  a
  manufacturer  in  this state to a purchaser outside this state when such
  opioid unit will be used or consumed outside this state.




   § 498. Imposition of excise tax. (a) There is hereby imposed an excise
  tax on the first sale of every opioid unit in the state at the following
  rates:  (1)  a quarter of a cent per morphine milligram equivalent where
  the wholesale acquisition cost is less than fifty cents, or (2) one  and
  one-half  cents  per  morphine  milligram equivalent where the wholesale
  acquisition cost is fifty cents or more; except that such tax shall  not
  apply  when  such  first  sale  is  to  any program operated pursuant to
  article forty of the public health law and  article  thirty-two  of  the
  mental  hygiene  law.  The  tax imposed by this article shall be charged
  against and paid by the registrant making such  first  sale,  and  shall
  accrue  at  the  time  of  such  sale.  For  the  purpose  of the proper
  administration of this article and to prevent evasion of the tax  hereby
  imposed,  it  shall  be presumed that any sale of an opioid unit in this
  state by a registrant is the first sale of such in the state  until  the
  contrary  is established, and the burden of proving that any sale is not
  the first sale in the state shall be upon the registrant.
    (b) Every registrant liable for the tax imposed by this article  shall
  file  with  the  commissioner  a return on forms to be prescribed by the
  commissioner  showing  the  total  morphine  milligram  equivalent   and
  wholesale acquisition costs of such opioid units that are subject to the
  tax  imposed  by  this  article, the amount of tax due thereon, and such
  further information as the commissioner may require. Such returns  shall
  be  filed  for  quarterly periods ending on the last day of March, June,
  September and December of each year. Each return shall be  filed  within
  twenty  days  after the end of such quarterly period and shall cover all
  opioid sales in the state made in the prior  quarter,  except  that  the
  first  return required to be filed pursuant to this section shall be due
  on January twentieth, two thousand twenty, and shall  cover  all  opioid
  sales occurring in the period between the effective date of this article
  and  December  thirty-first,  two  thousand  nineteen.  Every registrant
  required to file a return under this  section  shall,  at  the  time  of
  filing  such return, pay to the commissioner the total amount of tax due
  for the period covered by such return. If a return  is  not  filed  when
  due,  the tax shall be due the day on which the return is required to be
  filed. The commissioner  may  require  that  the  returns  and  payments
  required by this section be filed or paid electronically.
    (c)  Where a sale of an opioid unit by a registrant has been cancelled
  by the purchaser and tax thereon was previously paid by the  registrant,
  the  commissioner  shall  allow  to the registrant a refund or credit of
  such tax on a return for a  later  period  subject  to  the  limitations
  period  for  claiming  a  refund  or credit as prescribed by section one
  thousand eighty-seven of this chapter. Where a registrant proves that an
  opioid unit for which it previously paid a tax has been distributed  out
  of the state for use or consumption outside this state, the commissioner
  shall  allow  a  credit to the registrant for tax paid on a return for a
  later period subject to the limitations period for claiming a credit  as
  prescribed by section one thousand eighty-seven of this chapter.
    (d)  All  sales  slips,  invoices,  receipts,  or  other statements or
  memoranda of  sale  from  any  sale  or  purchase  of  opioid  units  by
  registrants  must  be  retained  for a period of six years after the due
  date of the  return  to  which  they  relate,  unless  the  commissioner
  provides  for  a  different retention period by rule or regulation. Such
  records must be sufficient to determine the number of units  transferred
  along  with  the morphine milligram equivalent of the units transferred,
  and otherwise be suitable to determine the correct amount  of  tax  due.
  Such  records  must  also  record  either (1) the address from which the
  units are shipped or delivered, along with  the  address  to  which  the
  units  are  shipped  or  delivered,  or  (2)  the  place at which actual


 physical possession of the units is transferred. Such records  shall  be
  produced upon demand by the commissioner.
    (e) The provisions of article twenty-seven of this chapter shall apply
  to  the tax imposed by this article in the same manner and with the same
  force  and  effect  as  if  the  language  of  such  article  had   been
  incorporated in full into this article and had expressly referred to the
  tax  imposed by this article, except to the extent that any provision of
  such article twenty-seven is either inconsistent  with  a  provision  of
  this article or is not relevant to this article.
    (f) The commissioners of education and health shall cooperate with the
  commissioner  in  administering  this  tax,  including  sharing with the
  commissioner pertinent information about registrants upon the request of
  the commissioner.
    (g) Each registrant shall provide a report to the department of health
  detailing all opioids sold by such registrant in the state of New  York.
  Such report shall include:
    (i)  the  registrant's  name,  address,  phone  number,  federal  Drug
  Enforcement  Agency  (DEA)  registration  number,  education  department
  registration  number,  and controlled substance license number issued by
  the department of health, if applicable;
    (ii) the name, address and DEA registration number of  the  entity  to
  whom the opioid was sold;
    (iii) the date of the sale of the opioid;
    (iv) the gross receipt total, in dollars, for each opioid sold;
    (v) the name and National Drug Code of the opioid sold;
    (vi)  the number of containers and the strength and metric quantity of
  controlled substance in each container of the opioid sold;
    (vii) the total number of morphine milligram equivalents sold; and
    (viii) any other elements as deemed necessary by the  commissioner  of
  health.
    Such information shall be reported annually in such form as defined by
  the commissioner of health and shall not be subject to the provisions of
  section  four hundred ninety-nine of this article. With the exception of
  the information collected under paragraph (ii) of this subdivision,  the

   §  499.  Returns  to be secret. (a) Except in accordance with a proper
  judicial order or as otherwise provided for by law, it shall be unlawful
  for the commissioner, any officer or employee of the department, or  any
  person engaged or retained by such department on an independent contract
  basis or any other person who in any manner may acquire knowledge of the

  proceeding in any court, except  on  behalf  of  the  state,  the  state
  department   of  health,  the  state  department  of  education  or  the
  commissioner in an action or proceeding under  the  provisions  of  this
  chapter  or  on  behalf  of  the  state or the commissioner in any other
  action or proceeding involving the collection of a tax  due  under  this
  chapter  to which the state or the commissioner is a party or a claimant
  or on behalf of  any  party  to  any  action  or  proceeding  under  the
  provisions of this article, when the returns or the reports or the facts
  shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in any
  of  which  events the court may require the production of, and may admit
  in evidence so much of said returns or reports or  of  the  facts  shown
  thereby  as  are  pertinent  to  the  action  or proceeding and no more.
  Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the commissioner,  in  his
  or  her  discretion,  from  allowing  the  inspection  or  delivery of a
  certified copy of any return or report filed under this article, or from
  providing any information contained in any such return or report, by  or
  to  a  duly  authorized  officer  or employee of the state department of
  health or the  state  department  of  education;  nor  to  prohibit  the
  inspection or delivery of a certified copy of any return or report filed

  the state when an  action  shall  have  been  recommended  or  commenced
  pursuant  to  this chapter in which such returns or reports or the facts
  shown thereby are directly involved; nor to  prohibit  the  commissioner
  from   providing  or  certifying  to  the  division  of  budget  or  the
  comptroller the total number of returns  or  reports  filed  under  this
  article  in  any  reporting  period  and  the total collections received
  therefrom; nor to prohibit the inspection  of  the  returns  or  reports
  required  under  this  article  by  the  comptroller  or duly designated
  officer or employee of the state department of audit  and  control,  for
  purposes  of  the  audit  of a refund of any tax paid by a registrant or
  other person under this article; nor  to  prohibit  the  delivery  to  a
  registrant,  or  a  duly authorized representative of such registrant, a
  certified copy of any return or report filed by such registrant pursuant
  to this article, nor  to  prohibit  the  publication  of  statistics  so
  classified  as  to  prevent  the identification of particular returns or
  reports and the items thereof.
    (a-1) Cooperation with investigations by  certain  committees  of  the
  United   States   Congress.   (1)   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of

  ownership  or  control  of  a  majority  interest  in  such  entity,  or
  otherwise, or filed by a partnership,  firm,  association,  corporation,
  joint-stock  company,  trust  or  similar entity of which any individual
  listed in this paragraph  holds  ten  percent  or  more  of  the  voting
  securities  of  such  entity; provided however that, prior to furnishing

  federal  return  that  is  reflected  on, such return or report, and any
  social  security  numbers,  account  numbers  and  residential   address

   § 502. Highway use registration. 1. a. Each carrier shall apply to the
  commissioner  for  a  certificate of registration for each motor vehicle
  operated or to be operated by such carrier on  the  public  highways  in
  this  state.  Application  shall  be made upon a form prescribed by such
  commissioner and shall set forth the gross and unloaded weight  of  each
  motor vehicle, license plate information for each motor vehicle and such
  other information as the commissioner may require. Such weights shall be
  subject  to  audit  and  approval  by the commissioner. The commissioner
  shall issue a certificate of registration for each motor  vehicle  or  a
  consolidated  certificate of registration for all or any portion of such
  vehicles of such carrier which shall contain such information and be  in
  such  form as the commissioner shall prescribe. In the case of the loss,
  mutilation  or  destruction  of  a  certificate  of  registration,   the
  commissioner  shall  issue  a duplicate thereof. Any such certificate of
  registration shall not be transferable, except as hereinafter  provided,
  and  shall  be  valid  until  revoked,  suspended  or  surrendered. Such
  certificate of registration shall be maintained in the carrier's regular
  place of business. In the event of an increase in the gross or  unloaded
  weight  of  any motor vehicle subject to this article, application for a
  corrected  certificate  of  registration  shall  be  made  upon  a  form
  prescribed  by  such  commissioner  setting  forth the previous gross or
  unloaded weight, the  new  gross  or  unloaded  weight  and  such  other
  information  as the commissioner may require. In the event of a decrease
  in the gross or unloaded weight of any motor  vehicle  subject  to  this
  article,  application  may  be  made  for  a  corrected  certificate  of
  registration in a similar manner, provided that any such application  on
  the  basis  of  a  decrease in the gross or unloaded weight of any motor
  vehicle may be made only during the month of January. In the event of  a
  decrease in the gross or unloaded weight of any motor vehicle subject to
  this  article, an application to cancel a certificate of registration on
  the basis of such decrease may be made during any month.  The  corrected
  gross  or  unloaded weight shall be subject to audit and approval by the
  commissioner. In the event of a change to the license plate  information
  of  any  motor  vehicle  subject  to  this article, an application for a
  corrected  certificate  of  registration  shall  be  made  upon  a  form
  prescribed  by the commissioner setting forth the previous license plate
  information,  the  new  license  plate  information   and   such   other
  information  as  the  commissioner  may  require.  Upon surrendering the
  certificate of registration previously issued,  the  commissioner  shall
  issue a corrected certificate of registration.
    b. Every automotive fuel carrier shall apply to the commissioner for a
  special  certificate  of  registration,  in  place of the certificate of
  registration described in paragraph a  of  this  subdivision,  for  each
  motor  vehicle  operated or to be operated by such carrier on the public
  highways in this state to transport automotive fuel. Provided,  however,
  a  special  certificate of registration shall not be required under this
  paragraph for a tractor or other  self-propelled  device  which,  except
  with  respect  to  the  fuel  in the ordinary fuel tank intended for its
  propulsion, transports automotive fuel solely by  means  of  a  trailer,
  dolly  or  other  device  drawn  by such tractor or other self-propelled
  device if a certificate of registration prescribed  by  paragraph  a  of
  this   subdivision  has  been  issued  for  the  self-propelled  device.
  Application shall be made upon an application  form  prescribed  by  the
  commissioner.  The  commissioner shall issue such special certificate of
  registration for each motor vehicle  listed  in  the  application  or  a
  consolidated  certificate of registration for all or any portion of such
  vehicles of such carrier. All of the provisions  of  this  article  with
  respect  to  certificates  of  registration  shall  be applicable to the


 special certificates of registration issued to automotive fuel  carriers
  under  this  paragraph as if those provisions had been set forth in full
  in this paragraph and expressly referred to the special certificates  of
  registration  required  by  this paragraph except to the extent that any
  such provision is either inconsistent with a provision of this paragraph
  or not relevant to the certificates of  registration  required  by  this
  paragraph.  Any  certificate  of registration shall not be transferable,
  and shall be valid until revoked, suspended or surrendered. Such special
  certificate of registration shall be maintained in the carrier's regular
  place of business. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any  way
  exempt  an  automotive  fuel  carrier  from payment of the taxes imposed
  pursuant to this article.
    c. In  lieu  of  the  certificate  of  registration  provided  for  in
  paragraph  a of this subdivision, but not in place of any certificate of
  registration required by paragraph b of this subdivision,  any  carrier,
  except  as hereinafter limited, may apply to the commissioner for a trip
  certificate of registration for any motor vehicle to be operated by  him
  or  her  on  the public highways of this state. Application for the trip
  certificate of registration shall be made on a form  prescribed  by  the
  commissioner,  shall  set  forth  the license plate information for each
  such motor vehicle  and  such  information  as  the  commissioner  shall
  require.  The  application  shall be accompanied by a fee of twenty-five
  dollars for each motor vehicle. Each trip  certificate  of  registration
  shall  be  valid  for a period of seventy-two hours from the time of its
  issuance. The issuance of a trip certificate of registration for a motor
  vehicle shall exempt the carrier from the requirement of filing  returns
  and  payment  of the taxes imposed by section five hundred three of this
  article on the operation of such motor vehicle for the effective  period
  of the trip certificate of registration but no refund application may be
  filed  on  account  of  trip  certificate  of registration applications.
  Provided, however, that in order for any person liable for  the  tax  to
  claim  such  exemption,  such  person  must  retain  a  copy of the trip
  certificate of registration in his records for the  complete  period  of
  time  required  by section five hundred seven of this article. A carrier
  may not apply for more than ten trip certificates of registration during
  a single calendar year.
    2. The commissioner, for cause, may deny a certificate of registration
  and suspend or revoke any certificate of registration issued by  him  or
  her,  after  an opportunity for a hearing has been afforded the carrier,
  provided, however, that a certificate of  registration  may  be  denied,
  suspended or revoked for failure to file a return as required by section
  five  hundred  five  of this article or for nonpayment of any monies due
  under this  article  without  a  hearing.  Such  denial,  suspension  or
  revocation of a certificate of registration for any motor vehicle of any
  carrier  shall  automatically  result in suspension or revocation of all
  certificates of registration issued to such  carrier,  unless  otherwise
  specified  by  the commissioner. A violation of any of the provisions of
  this  article  or  of  any  rule  or  regulation  of  the   commissioner
  promulgated under this article shall constitute sufficient cause for the
  denial,  suspension  or revocation of a certificate of registration. The
  nonpayment of any monies due for any other tax or  imposition  which  is
  administered  by  the commissioner shall constitute sufficient cause for
  the denial of a certificate of registration.  Any  such  action  by  the
  commissioner  shall  be  reviewable  under  article seventy-eight of the
  civil practice law and rules.
    3. If the certificate of registration of any motor  vehicle  has  been
  suspended or revoked under this section the department of motor vehicles
  shall  not  thereafter  reregister  the  motor  vehicle  or transfer the


 registration of ownership thereof upon the records of the department  of
  motor vehicles until there is furnished to such department a certificate
  issued  by  the  commissioner  to  the effect that such person has fully
  complied  with  the  provisions of this article. The department of motor
  vehicles shall not reregister or transfer the  registered  ownership  of
  any  motor  vehicle  for  which  a  certificate of registration has been
  issued under this article until there is furnished to it  a  certificate
  of  tax  clearance  issued  by the commissioner. Such certificate of tax
  clearance shall be issued after the payment of all monies due under this
  article or after the payment of  any  such  amount  is  secured  to  the
  satisfaction of the commissioner.
    4.  Nothing  herein  contained shall be construed as authorizing motor
  vehicle weight limits in excess of those permitted by  the  vehicle  and
  traffic law.
    5.  For purposes of this section, monies due shall be considered to be
  due if the monies have been assessed or finally determined to be due.
    6. a. The commissioner may require the use of decals as evidence  that
  a carrier has a valid certificate of registration for each motor vehicle
  operated  or  to  be  operated  on  the public highways of this state as
  required by paragraph a of subdivision  one  of  this  section.  If  the
  commissioner  requires  the  use of decals, the commissioner shall issue
  for each motor vehicle with a valid certificate of registration a  decal
  that  shall  be  of a size and design and containing such information as
  the commissioner prescribes. In the case of  the  loss,  mutilation,  or
  destruction  of  a  decal, the commissioner shall issue a new decal upon
  proof of the facts. The decal shall be firmly and conspicuously  affixed
  upon the motor vehicle for which it is issued as closely as practical to
  the  registration  or  license  plates  and  at all times be visible and
  legible. No decal is transferable. A  decal  shall  be  valid  until  it
  expires or is revoked, suspended, or surrendered.
    b.  The commissioner may require the use of special decals as evidence
  that an automotive fuel carrier  has  a  valid  special  certificate  of
  registration  for  each  motor vehicle operated or to be operated on the
  public highways of this state to transport automotive fuel  as  required
  by  paragraph  b of subdivision one of this section. If the commissioner
  requires the use of special decals, the  commissioner  shall  issue  for
  each  motor  vehicle  with a valid special certificate of registration a
  special decal that shall be distinctively colored  and  of  a  size  and
  design  and  containing such information as the commissioner prescribes.
  In the case of the loss, mutilation, or destruction of a special  decal,
  the  commissioner  shall  issue  a  new  special decal upon proof of the
  facts. The special decal shall be firmly and conspicuously affixed  upon
  the  motor  vehicle  for  which  it  is issued pursuant to the rules and
  regulations  prescribed  by  the  commissioner  to   enable   the   easy
  identification   of   the   automotive   fuel   carrier  certificate  of
  registration number and at all times be visible and legible. No  special
  decal is transferable and shall be valid until it expires or is revoked,
  suspended, or surrendered.
    c.  The  suspension  or  revocation of any certificate of registration
  issued under this article shall be deemed to include the suspension  and
  revocation of any decal issued under this subdivision.




   §  502-a.  Certificate of registration and decal fees. The application
  for a certificate of registration and decal described in paragraph a  of
  subdivision  one  and  paragraph  a  of  subdivision six of section five
  hundred two of this article, or a special  certificate  of  registration
  and  special  decal  as  described in paragraph b of subdivision one and
  paragraph b of subdivision six of such section, shall be accompanied  by
  a fee of one dollar and fifty cents. In the case of the loss, mutilation
  or  destruction  of  any  such documents, the commissioner shall issue a
  duplicate set thereof upon payment of a fee  of  one  dollar  and  fifty
  cents.  Provided,  however,  there shall be no additional charge for the
  issuance  of  a  corrected  certificate  of  registration  pursuant   to
  paragraph  a  of  subdivision  one  of  section five hundred two of this
  article.




   §  503.  Imposition  of  tax.  1.  In addition to any other tax or fee
  imposed by law, there is hereby levied and imposed a highway use tax for
  the privilege of operating any vehicular unit upon the  public  highways
  of  this  state  and  for  the purpose of recompensing the state for the
  public expenditures  incurred  by  reason  of  the  operations  of  such
  vehicular units on the public highways of this state.  Such tax shall be
  upon  the carrier except that where the carrier is not the owner of such
  vehicular unit, the tax shall be a  joint  and  several  liability  upon
  both.  Such  tax  shall  be  based  upon  the gross weight of each motor
  vehicle and the number of miles it is operated on the public highways in
  this state except as hereinafter provided.
    (a) The  tax  for  each  such  motor  vehicle  shall  be  computed  by
  multiplying  the number of miles operated on the public highways in this
  state by the appropriate tax rate as it  appears  in  the  gross  weight
  method  table  entitled "laden miles" set forth in paragraph (b) of this
  subdivision for the gross weight of the motor vehicle.

    (c) Provided, however, when a motor vehicle is  operated  without  any
  load  or  cargo, either alone or when it is drawing an unloaded trailer,
  semi-trailer, dolly or other  device,  the  carrier  shall  in  lieu  of
  computing  the  tax  by  the  gross  weight method table entitled "laden


 miles" compute the tax by multiplying the number of miles operated under
  such conditions by the appropriate tax rate entitled "unladen miles" for
  tractors set forth in this paragraph, if the vehicular unit is propelled
  by  a  tractor, and by the appropriate tax rate entitled "unladen miles"
  for trucks set forth  in  this  paragraph,  if  the  vehicular  unit  is
  propelled  by a truck. Such tax rate shall be determined by the unloaded
  weight of the tractor if the motor vehicle is  a  tractor  and,  in  all
  other  cases,  by the combined unloaded weight of any such motor vehicle
  plus the unloaded weight of the heaviest trailer, semi-trailer, dolly or
  other device to be drawn by such motor vehicle (determined in  a  manner
  similar  to  the  methods for determining the unloaded weight of a motor
  vehicle) when the motor  vehicle  is  operated  under  such  conditions.
  Provided  further,  however,  when an unloaded tractor is being operated
  alone, the carrier shall compute the  tax  by  multiplying  the  mileage
  operated  under  such  conditions by the appropriate tax rate for trucks
  set forth in this paragraph determined at the  unloaded  weight  of  the
  tractor.

  5.    26,001 to 28,000 inclusive                  9.5
  6.    28,001 to 30,000 inclusive                 10.0
  7.    30,001 and over                            add five tenths of
                                                   a mill per ton and
                                                   fraction thereof
 
    (d)  Provided,  however,  for  purposes  of determining the applicable
  rates of tax under this subdivision, for those miles when a  truck  does
  not  draw  a  trailer,  semi-trailer,  dolly  or other device, the gross
  weight and unloaded weight of the  truck  shall  be  determined  without
  regard to the weight of any trailer, semi-trailer, dolly or other device
  drawn  at  other times by the truck or the weight of any load carried by
  any such trailer, semi-trailer, dolly or other device.
    2. In lieu of basing the tax on the gross weight and mileage  of  each
  vehicular  unit consisting of a combination of motor vehicle and trailer
  operated as a unit, any carrier operating more than one  such  vehicular
  unit  may elect in his return to base the tax on (i) the gross weight of
  its heaviest laden motor vehicle and the number of laden  miles  all  of


 its  motor  vehicles  are  operated on the public highways of this state
  under such condition by the tax rate entitled "laden miles" set forth in
  paragraph (b) of subdivision one of this section plus (ii) the  unloaded
  weight  of  its  heaviest  unladen  tractor,  if  the  vehicular unit is
  propelled by a tractor and in all other cases, by the combined  unloaded
  weight  of  the  motor  vehicle plus the unloaded weight of the heaviest
  trailer, semi-trailer, dolly or other device to be drawn by  such  motor
  vehicle  (determined  in  a manner similar to the method for determining
  the unloaded weight of a motor vehicle) and the number of unladen  miles
  all  of  its  motor vehicles are operated on the public highways of this
  state under such conditions by the tax rate entitled "unladen miles" set
  forth in paragraph (c) of  subdivision  one  of  this  section  for  the
  tractor  or  truck,  as  the  case  may  be.  Provided, however, when an
  unloaded tractor is being operated alone, the carrier  in  lieu  of  the
  computation required by clause (ii) of this subdivision for such mileage
  shall  compute the tax for the mileage operated under such conditions by
  multiplying the appropriate tax  rate  for  trucks  set  forth  in  such
  paragraph  determined  at  the  unloaded  weight  of  the  tractor. Such
  election may be made with respect to each return filed by a carrier  and
  shall  apply  to  all  such  motor vehicles required to be included in a
  return of the carrier during the taxable period  covered  thereby.  Such
  election  shall  be  irrevocable  with respect to the taxable period for
  which the return is filed.
    3. In lieu of computing the tax on the basis provided in the preceding
  subdivisions, any carrier may elect to compute the tax on the  basis  of
  the  unloaded weight of each motor vehicle and the number of miles it is
  operated on the public highways in this state. The tax computed for each
  such motor vehicle shall be computed by multiplying the number of  miles
  operated  on  the  public  highways in this state by the appropriate tax
  rate in the following tables:
 
                                                  Tax Rate

  5.    10,001 to 12,000 inclusive                 25
  6.    12,001 and over                            33
 
  Such election may be made by  the  carrier  only  on  the  first  return
  required  to be filed by him in any calendar year and shall apply to all
  motor vehicles required to be included therein. Such election  shall  be


 irrevocable  with respect to the taxable period for which such return is
  filed and all subsequent returns covering operations during any part  of
  the calendar year in which such election is made.
