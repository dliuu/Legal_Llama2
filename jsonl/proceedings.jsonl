Where the reverter or breach occurred before September 1, 1963, an action may be maintained if demand is made as provided in this section before the expiration of ten years computed from the occurrence of the reverter or the first occurrence of the breach, or on or before September 1, 1965, whichever is later, and the action is commenced within one year thereafter or if, without previous demand as provided in this section, the action is commenced before the expiration of ten years computed from the occurrence of the reverter or the first occurrence of the breach, or on or before September 1, 1965, whichever is later.3.

If the person entitled to maintain the action shall have died, the demand may be made either by the persons succeeding to the right of the decedent, or one of them, or on their behalf by the personal representative of the decedent.5. The demand shall become ineffective unless action to recover possession in accordance therewith is commenced within one year from the date of service thereof. If no action is commenced, or no such demand is served within the time specified in subdivisions 1 or 2, or if the demand served becomes ineffective, it shall be conclusively presumed that the possibility of reverter by reason of which the estate is claimed to have reverted, or the power of termination for breach of the condition which is claimed to have been broken, was extinguished at or before the date when the reverter would have occurred or a right of entry would have accrued by reason of such possibility of reverter or breach of such condition.6. The operation of this section is not affected by any disability, or by the fact that the person against whom the action might have been brought within the period herein provided was during that time a non-resident or absent from the state, and is not affected by any lack of knowledge on the part of any person that the reverter or breach has occurred, unless it is established that the facts upon which the reverter occurred, or the facts constituting the breach, were concealed from the plaintiff or his predecessor in interest by actual fraud. If such fraud be established, the time provided in subdivision 1 or 2 shall commence to run when the facts are discovered by a person entitled to serve the demand as provided in this section.7. This section does not limit any other statute or rule of law or equity by which a possibility of reverter or right of entry is or may be extinguished or rendered unenforceable, or by which an action to recover possession of the property may be extinguished or barred."}

The tenant continues in possession of any portion of the premises after the expiration of his term, without the permission of the landlord or, in a case where a new lessee is entitled to possession, without the permission of the new lessee. Acceptance of rent after commencement of the special proceeding upon this ground shall not terminate such proceeding nor effect any award of possession to the landlord or to the new lessee, as the case may be. A proceeding seeking to recover possession of real property by reason of the termination of the term fixed in the lease pursuant to a provision contained therein giving the landlord the right to terminate the time fixed for occupancy under such agreement if he deem the tenant objectionable, shall not be maintainable unless the landlord shall by competent evidence establish to the satisfaction of the court that the tenant is objectionable.2. The tenant has defaulted in the payment of rent, pursuant to the agreement under which the premises are held, and a written demand of the rent has been made with at least fourteen days' notice requiring, in the alternative, the payment of the rent, or the possession of the premises, has been served upon him as prescribed in section seven hundred thirty-five of this article. Any person succeeding to the landlord's interest in the premises may proceed under this subdivision for rent due his predecessor in interest if he has a right thereto.

Entry of such a judgment shall be without prejudice to the possessory claims of the occupants, and any warrant issued shall not be effective as against the occupants.3. The tenant, in a city defaults in the payment, for sixty days after the same shall be payable, of any taxes or assessments levied on the premises which he has agreed in writing to pay pursuant to the agreement under which the premises are held, and a demand for payment has been made, or at least three days' notice in writing, requiring in the alternative the payment thereof and of any interest and penalty thereon, or the possession of the premises, has been served upon him, as prescribed in section 735. An acceptance of any rent shall not be construed as a waiver of the agreement to pay taxes or assessments.4. The tenant, under a lease for a term of three years or less, has during the term taken the benefit of an insolvency statute or has been adjudicated a bankrupt.5. The premises, or any part thereof, are used or occupied as a bawdy-house, or house or place of assignation for lewd persons, or for purposes of prostitution, or for any illegal trade or manufacture, or other illegal business.6. The tenant, in a city having a population of one million or more, removes the batteries or otherwise disconnects or makes inoperable an installed smoke or fire detector which the tenant has not requested be moved from its location so as not to interfere with the reasonable use of kitchen facilities provided that the court, upon complaint thereof, has previously issued an order of violation of the provisions heretofore stated and, subsequent to the thirtieth day after service of such order upon the tenant, an official inspection report by the appropriate department of housing preservation and development is presented, in writing, indicating non-compliance herewith; provided further, that the tenant shall have the additional ten day period to cure such violation in accordance with the provisions of subdivision four of section seven hundred fifty-three of this chapter."}

In a proceeding to recover the possession of premises occupied for dwelling purposes, other than a room or rooms in an hotel, lodging house, or rooming house, the court, on application of the occupant, may stay the issuance of a warrant and also stay any execution to collect the costs of the proceeding for a period of not more than one year, if it appears that the premises are used for dwelling purposes; that the application is made in good faith; that the applicant cannot within the neighborhood secure suitable premises similar to those occupied by the applicant and that the applicant made due and reasonable efforts to secure such other premises, or that by reason of other facts it would occasion extreme hardship to the applicant or the applicant's family if the stay were not granted. In determining whether refusal to grant a stay would occasion extreme hardship, the court shall consider serious ill health, significant exacerbation of an ongoing condition, a child's enrollment in a local school, and any other extenuating life circumstances affecting the ability of the applicant or the applicant's family to relocate and maintain quality of life. The court shall consider any substantial hardship the stay may impose on the landlord in determining whether to grant the stay or in setting the length or other terms of the stay. In an application brought outside a city of one million or more, the term neighborhood shall be construed to mean (i) the same town, village or city where the applicant now resides, or (ii) if the applicant has school aged children residing with him or her, neighborhood shall mean the school district where such children attend or are eligible to attend.2. Such stay shall be granted and continue effective only upon the condition that the person against whom the judgment is entered shall make a deposit in court of the entire amount, or such installments thereof from time to time as the court may direct, for the occupation of the premises for the period of the stay, at the rate for which the applicant was liable as rent for the month immediately prior to the expiration of the applicant's term or tenancy, plus such additional amount, if any, as the court may determine to be the difference between such rent and the reasonable rent or value of the use and occupation of the premises; such deposit may also include all rent unpaid by the occupant prior to the period of the stay. The amount of such deposit shall be determined by the court upon the application for the stay and such determination shall be final and conclusive in respect to the amount of such deposit, and the amount thereof shall be paid into court, in such manner and in such installments, if any, as the court may direct. A separate account shall be kept of the amount to the credit of each proceeding, and all such payments shall be deposited in a bank or trust company and shall be subject to the check of the clerk of the court, if there be one, or otherwise of the court. The clerk of the court, if there be one, and otherwise the court shall pay to the landlord or the landlord's duly authorized agent, the amount of such deposit in accordance with the terms of the stay or the further order of the court.3. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a proceeding to recover possession upon the ground that an occupant is holding over and is objectionable if the landlord shall establish by competent evidence to the satisfaction of the court that such occupant is objectionable.4. In the event that such proceeding is based upon a claim that the tenant or lessee has breached a provision of the lease, the court shall grant a thirty day stay of issuance of the warrant, during which time the respondent may correct such breach.5. Any provision of a lease or other agreement whereby a lessee or tenant waives any provision of this section shall be deemed against public policy and void."}

The court may appoint the commissioner of the department of the city of New York charged with enforcement of the housing maintenance code of such city or the commissioner's designee as such administrator, provided that the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall consent, in writing, to such appointment. Any administrator is authorized and empowered in accordance with the direction of the court, to order the necessary materials, labor and services to remove or remedy the conditions specified in the judgment, and to make disbursements in payment thereof; and to demand, collect and receive the rents from the tenants; and to institute all necessary legal proceedings including, but not limited to, summary proceedings for the removal of any tenant or tenants; and to rent or lease for terms not exceeding three years any part of said premises, however, the court may direct the administrator to rent or lease commercial parts of said premises for terms that the court may approve.

If such administrator cannot provide such services and correct such conditions by the dates specified in the plan, he shall be required to file with the court an amendment to the plan setting forth the reasons why such services and corrections could not be provided by such date and specifying new dates for such services and corrections. Such plan and any amendments to such plan shall be provided to the tenants by mail or by posting in a common area of the building and to the owner of record by mail.10.[Repealed Effective 6302024](a) Where a building for which an administrator has been appointed pursuant to this section is transferred to a new owner at any time following the appointment of such administrator, whether or not such building remains subject to such administrator, the department charged with enforcement of the housing maintenance code of the city of New York may enter into a regulatory agreement with such new owner. Such regulatory agreement may impose such terms and conditions upon the operation and repair of such building as such department may determine.

(a) Every co-tenant who requests or joins a request for partition of heirs property by sale has thereby agreed that his or her interest may be acquired in accordance herewith at the value determined under subdivision six of this section by the co-tenants who have not sought or joined in the request for partition by sale. Upon determination that the property is heirs property and prior to the determination of value under subdivision six of this section, the court shall send notice to all parties identifying the owners of interests that have sought partition by sale, the percentage interests such owners allege to hold and of the right of the remaining co-tenants to avert partition by sale by exercising the right to purchase all of the interests of the co-tenants who requested partition by sale.(b) Not later than forty-five days after the notice of the determination of value under subdivision six of this section is sent and by the date specified in such notice, any co-tenant, except a co-tenant that requested partition by sale, may give notice to the court of the total amount of percentage interests subject to purchase that he or she elects to buy; provided, however, the court shall make a determination of each co-tenant's percentage ownership interest in the property prior to sending notice of the determination of value if such interest is in dispute and shall consider all facts as determined by the court and presented by the parties, and all laws and rules that govern the transfer, succession and acquisition of title through probate, intestacy or otherwise.(c) The purchase price for percentage interests shall be the value of the entire parcel determined under subdivision six of this section multiplied by the aggregate amount of the percentage interests subject to purchase.(d) After expiration of the period in paragraph (b) of this subdivision, the following rules apply: (i) If one or more co-tenants have elected in the aggregate to buy at least the total amount of percentage interests subject to purchase, the court shall notify all the parties of such fact.(ii) If the electing co-tenants' offers equal or exceed the amount of percentage interests subject to purchase, the court shall allocate the right to buy those interests among the electing co-tenants based on each electing co-tenant's existing fractional ownership of the entire parcel divided by the total existing fractional ownership of all co-tenants electing to buy, reserving priority, first, to electing co-tenants who acquired the interest from a relative and reside in the property and, second, to all other electing co-tenants who acquired their interest from a relative, and send notice to all the parties of the foregoing and of the price to be paid by each electing co-tenant.(iii) If co-tenants with the right to elect fail to elect to purchase the entirety of the interests of the co-tenants whose interests are subject to purchase, the court shall send notice to all the parties of such fact and resolve the partition action under paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision eight of this section.(e) If the court sends notice to the parties under subparagraph (i) or (ii) of paragraph (d) of this subdivision, the court shall set a date, not sooner than sixty days after the date the notice was sent, by which electing co-tenants must pay their apportioned price into the court. After this date, the following rules apply: (i) If all electing co-tenants timely pay his or her apportioned price to the court, the court shall issue an order reallocating all the interests of the co-tenants and disburse the amounts held by the court to the persons entitled to them.(ii) If no electing co-tenant timely pays his or her apportioned price, the court shall resolve the partition action under paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision eight of this section as if the interests of the co-tenants that requested partition by sale were not purchased.(iii) If one or more, but not all, of the electing co-tenants fail to pay their apportioned price on time, the court, on motion, shall give notice to the electing co-tenants that paid their apportioned price of percentage of the unpurchased interests remaining and the price for all such interests.(f) Not later than twenty days after the court gives notice pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (e) of this subdivision, any co-tenant that paid his or her apportioned price may elect to purchase all of the remaining interest by paying the entire price to the court. After the twenty day period, the following rules shall apply: (i) If only one co-tenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall issue an order reallocating the remaining interest to such co-tenant. The court shall issue promptly an order reallocating the interests of all of the co-tenants and disburse the amounts held by the court to the persons entitled to such amounts.(ii) If no co-tenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall resolve the partition action under paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision eight of this section as if the interests of the co-tenants that requested partition by sale were not purchased.(iii) If more than one co-tenant pays the entire price for the remaining interest, the court shall reapportion those remaining interests among those paying co-tenants, based on each paying co-tenant's original fractional ownership of the entire parcel divided by the total original fractional ownership of all co-tenants that paid the entire price for the remaining interest. The court shall issue promptly an order reallocating all of the co-tenants' interests, disburse the amounts held by the court to the persons entitled to such amounts, and promptly refund any excess payment held by the court.(g) Not later than forty-five days after the court sends notice to the parties pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision, any co-tenant entitled to buy an interest under this subdivision may request the court to authorize the sale as part of the pending action of the interests of co-tenants named as defendants and served with the complaint but that did not appear in the action.(h) If the court receives a timely request under paragraph (g) of this subdivision, the court, after a hearing, may deny the request or authorize the requested additional sale on such terms as the court determines are fair and reasonable, subject to the following limitations: (i) a sale authorized under this subdivision may occur only after the purchase prices for all interests subject to sale under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this subdivision have been paid to the court and such interests have been reallocated among the co-tenants as provided in such paragraphs; and(ii) the purchase price for the interest of a non-appearing co-tenant is based on the court's determination of value under subdivision six of this section.8. Partition alternatives. (a) If all the interests of all co-tenants that requested partition by sale are not purchased by other co-tenants pursuant to subdivision seven of this section, or if after conclusion of the buyout under subdivision seven of this section, a co-tenant remains that has requested partition in kind, the court shall order partition in kind unless the court, after consideration of the factors listed in subdivision nine of this section, finds that partition in kind will result in great manifest prejudice to the co-tenants as a group. In considering whether to order partition in kind, the court shall approve a request by two or more parties to have their individual interests aggregated.(b) If the court does not order partition in kind under paragraph (a) of this subdivision, the court shall order partition by sale pursuant to subdivision ten of this section provided that, if no co-tenant timely requested partition by sale, the court shall dismiss the action.(c) If the court orders partition in kind pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision, the court may require that one or more co-tenants pay one or more other co-tenants amounts so that the payments, taken together with the value of the in kind distributions to the co-tenants, will make the partition in kind just and proportionate in value to the fractional interests held.(d) If the court orders partition in kind, the court shall allocate to the co-tenants that are unknown, cannot be located, or the subject of a default judgment, if the co-tenants interests were not bought out pursuant to subdivision seven of this section, a part of the property representing the combined interests of such co-tenants as determined by the court and such part of the property shall remain undivided.9. Considerations for partition in kind. (a) In determining under subdivision eight of this section whether partition in kind would result in great manifest prejudice to the co-tenants as a group, the court shall consider the following: (i) whether the heirs property practicably can be divided among the co-tenants;(ii) whether partition in kind would apportion the property in such a way that the aggregate fair market value of the parcels resulting from the division would be materially less than the amount reasonably expected to be realized if the property were sold as a whole, taking into account the conditions under which a court-ordered sale likely would occur;(iii) evidence of the collective duration of ownership or possession of the property by a co-tenant and one or more predecessors in title or predecessors in possession to the co-tenant who are or were relatives of the co-tenant or each other;(iv) a co-tenant's sentimental attachment to the property, including any attachment arising because the property has ancestral or other unique or special value to the co-tenant;(v) the lawful use being made of the property by a resident or other co-tenant and the degree to which any such co-tenant would be harmed if the co-tenant could not continue the same use of the property;(vi) the degree to which the co-tenants have contributed their pro rata share of the property taxes, insurance, and other expenses associated with maintaining ownership of the property or have contributed to the physical improvement, maintenance, or upkeep of the property;(vii) the price, terms and conditions of the acquisition of the co-tenant's interest in the property if such co-tenant is not a relative of the person from whom it acquired his or her interest; and(viii) any other relevant factor.(b) The court shall not consider any one factor in paragraph (a) of this subdivision to be dispositive without weighing the totality of all relevant factors and circumstances.10. Open-market sale, sealed bids, or auction.

If the court orders an auction, the auction shall be conducted in accordance with section two hundred thirty-one of this chapter.(f) If a purchaser is entitled to a share of the proceeds of the sale, the purchaser is entitled to a credit against the price in an amount equal to the purchaser's share of the net proceeds.11.

The determination as to whether a sum in gross or the earnings of a sum invested shall be awarded to the owner of such particular estate shall be governed by the provisions of section 968 with respect to the proceeds of a sale in partition."}

Whenever an executor, trustee, guardian of an infant, committee of a person incompetent to manage himself or his affairs, conservator of a person unable to care for his affairs, or other person or persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, or a life tenant, is authorized to sell any real property or any interest therein pursuant to a power contained in a deed or will, or pursuant to a judgment or order of the supreme court in an action or special proceeding pursuant to any provision of law, or pursuant to a statutory power to sell or exchange any real property, or any interest therein, or whenever a trustee of an express trust is seized of a legal title to an undivided share or interest in any real property, and the said property has been or is about to be conveyed to a corporation formed or to be formed for such purpose, and two-thirds in number and amount of interest of the adult beneficiaries and also two-thirds in number and amount of interest of the adult persons having a vested interest or estate in possession, reversion or remainder in such real property have agreed, or desire to agree that their interests and estates shall be exchanged for the stock and bonds or either the stock or bonds of such corporation, then the said executor, trustee, guardian, committee, conservator or other person or persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, or the life tenant or tenants, may, with the approval of the supreme court, convey such real property or interest to such corporation in exchange for the stock or bonds of such corporation, or a proportionate amount thereof, provided, however, that such corporation shall be prohibited by its certificate of incorporation from investing in any stocks, bonds or other securities other than real property which are not under the laws of this state a proper subject for the investment of trust funds, and provided further that if the interest of a trust estate in any real property to be so exchanged is an undivided part or share therein, such undivided part or share of the trust estate may be so exchanged if it shall appear to the court to be for the best interest of such estate.2. The supreme court shall not grant an order permitting such an exchange and conveyance unless it appears to the satisfaction of such court that a written notice stating the time and place of the application for such leave has been served upon every beneficiary and also upon every person in being having a vested interest or estate in possession, reversion or remainder, in such real property at least eight days before the making thereof, if such beneficiary or other person is an adult within the state; or if a minor, incompetent, conservatee, or absentee, until proof of the service on such beneficiary or other person of such notice as the court or a justice thereof prescribes.3. The court shall appoint a guardian for any minor and for any person unable to manage himself or his affairs who shall not be represented by a committee or conservator duly appointed.4. The application must be by petition duly verified, must be made by the executor, trustee, guardian of an infant, committee, conservator, or such other person or persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, or a life tenant who has been so authorized to sell or exchange, or by the trustee of an express trust seized of a legal title to an undivided share or interest in real property; and shall set forth the reasons for such exchange and conveyance and the nature thereof and the peculiar facts which make it proper that the application shall be granted, but when the interest of a trust estate in any real property is an undivided part or share thereof, it shall be sufficient to show by such petition that the exchange will be for the best interests of such estate. After taking proof of the facts either before the court or a referee, and hearing the parties and fully examining into the matter, the court must direct judgment upon the application. In case the application is granted, the judgment must authorize the said executor, trustee, guardian of an infant, committee, conservator, or other person or persons acting in a fiduciary capacity or life tenant, to make such exchange and conveyance upon such terms and conditions as the court may therein prescribe.5. Whenever it shall appear from the papers submitted upon the application that there are conflicting claims in respect to the ownership of or the right to sell and convey such real property or any interest therein, the court may, within the demand for relief as evidenced by the notice of application, and if all adult beneficiaries, and also all adult persons having a vested interest or estate in possession, reversion or remainder in such real property under such conflicting claims consent thereto, direct that the stock and bonds or either the stock or bonds to be given by the corporation in exchange for such real property or interest therein shall be issued to and held by a trust company authorized to hold moneys paid into court upon such terms and conditions and with such powers as the court shall prescribe until the further order of the court."}

Where an infant, person with a mental disability, or conservatee holds real property, in joint tenancy or in common, the general guardian of the infant, or the committee of the person with a mental disability, or conservator of the conservatee, may apply to the supreme court or to the county court of the county wherein the real property is situated, for authority to agree to a partition of the real property. Where such application affects the interests of an incompetent person or a conservatee who has been committed to a state institution, and is an inmate thereof, notice of such application must be given to the superintendent, acting superintendent or state officer having special jurisdiction over the institution where the incompetent person or conservatee is confined. Irrespective of the location of any real property held by an infant in joint tenancy or in common, his general guardian may make such application to the surrogate's court which appointed such guardian. A certified copy of the decree entered in the surrogate's court on such application must be recorded in the office of the clerk of each county in which is situated property affected by such decree.2. Such an application must be by a petition, which must describe the real property proposed to be partitioned; must state the rights and interests of the several owners thereof; must specify the particular partition proposed to be made; and must be verified by affidavit. The court may order notice of the application to be given to such persons as it thinks proper.3. If, after due inquiry into the merits of the application, by a reference or otherwise, the court is of the opinion that the interests of the infant, or person with a mental disability, or conservatee, will be promoted by the partition proposed, it may make an order authorizing the petitioner to agree to the partition proposed, and in the name of the infant, person with a mental disability, or conservatee, to execute releases of his right and interest in and to that part of the property which falls to the shares of the other joint-tenants or tenants in common. The court may, in its discretion, for the furtherance of the interests of said infant, person with a mental disability, or conservatee, direct partition to be so made as to set off to him or them his or their share in common with any of the other owners, provided the consent in writing thereto of such owners shall be first obtained.4. Releases so executed have the same validity and effect, as if they were executed by the person in whose behalf they are executed, and as if the infant was of full age, person with a mental disability, was of sound mind, and competent to manage his affairs, or the conservatee was competent to manage his affairs."}

No reverter shall occur and no possessory estate shall result by reason of such special limitation, and no right of entry shall accrue by reason of breach of such condition subsequent, but upon the happening of such a breach the person or persons who would have such possessory estate or right of entry except for this section, may maintain an action in the supreme court to compel a conveyance to him or them of the land, or the interest therein, which is subject to the special limitation or condition subsequent.3.

This section shall not apply where the special limitation or condition subsequent was created in a conveyance or devise, whether or not in trust, for benevolent, charitable, educational, public or religious purposes and restricts the use of land to such a purpose or to a particular application or means of carrying out such purpose, or was created by a lease for a term of less than one hundred years and restricts use of the leased premises."}
